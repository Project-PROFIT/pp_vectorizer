The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new
manufacturing processes in the period from about
1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This
transition included going from hand production
methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing
and iron production processes, the increasing use of
steam power, the development of machine tools and
the rise of the factory system.
Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial
Revolution in terms of employment, value of output
and capital invested. The textile industry was also the
first to use modern production methods.

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and
many of the technological innovations were of British
origin.

, controlling a
global trading empire with colonies in North America
and Africa, and with some political influence on the Indian subcontinent, through the activities of the East India Company.

development of trade and the rise of business were major causes of the Industrial Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In
particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major
impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the
first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th
centuries.

GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,
[8] while
the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.
[9] Economic historians are in
agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the
domestication of animals and plants.

The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social
changes.
[11][12][13][14] Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until
the 1830s or 1840s,
[11] while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.
[12] Rapid industrialization first
began in Britain, starting with mechanized spinning in the 1780s,
[15] with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production
occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the
early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in
France.

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the
Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late
in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, hot blast iron smelting and new
technologies, such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high

rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been
called the Second Industrial Revolution. These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture
of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.

Textile manufacture
British textile industry statistics
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire.
The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was
22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines. [1]:41–42
The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831. Value added
by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801. Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797. In 1760
approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800. In 1781 cotton spun
amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800. In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was
produced on machinery invented in Britain. In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30
years. [30]
Wages in Lancashire, a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in
India in 1770, when overall productivity in Britain was about three times higher than in India. [30]
Cotton
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing cotton
textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most
was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.
In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all
Chinese wore cotton clothing. Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a medium of exchange. In India a significant
amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers. Some merchants also
owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality. [30]
Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown in the Americas. [30] The early Spanish explorers
found Native Americans growing unknown species of good quality cotton: sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and upland
green seeded cotton Gossypium hirsutum. Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South
Carolina, but did poorly inland. Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650's. Upland green seeded cotton
grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S. , but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem
solved by the cotton gin. [17]:157 A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the
parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to
pick. [30]
Trade and textilesThe Age of Discovery was followed by a period of colonialism beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a
trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie
(abbr. VOC) or Dutch East India Company and the British founded the East India Company, along with smaller companies of
different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region
and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe. One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles,
which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for
sale to Southeast Asia and Europe. By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports. Indian
textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the
amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century. [30]
Pre-mechanized European textile production
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English
towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well
established; however, they were left alone by the guilds who did not
consider cotton a threat. Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning
and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern
Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of
cotton was cut off. The Moors in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton

beginning around the 10th century. [30]
British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of
Britain's. [31] In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed Calico Acts in order to protect the domestic woollen and linen
industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India. [1][32]
The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around Lancashire that produced fustian, a cloth with flax
warp and cotton weft. Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting
blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew. [32]
On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a
cottage industry under the putting-out system. Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the
putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials. In the
off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving. Using the spinning wheel, it took
anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver. [1][32][33]:823
Invention of textile machinery
The flying shuttle patented in 1733 by John Kay, with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747,
doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving. It became widely used around
Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, Robert, invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors. [33]:821–22
Lewis Paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The
technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of Birmingham. Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used
their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of
Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt
down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at
different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by Richard
Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule.
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770. It was
the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles. [34] The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first
clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting. [35] It was a simple, wooden framed machine thatonly cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792, [36] and was used mainly by
home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft,
not warp. [33]:825–27
The spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who,
along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a
spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was
hired by Arkwright. [33]:827–30 For each spindle, the water frame used a series of
four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to
draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller spacing was
slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused the fibres to
break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. The top rollers were
leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. The weights
kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood
and metal, with fluting along the length. The water frame was able to produce a

hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth
to be made in Britain. A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at
a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.
Samuel Crompton's Spinning Mule was introduced in 1779. Mule implies a hybrid
because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which
the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational
sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from
the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started
rotating. [33]:832 Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand
spinning and at a lower cost. Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used
as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large
quantities. [33]:832
Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the
supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright
developed a vertical power loom which he patented in 1785. In 1776 he patented a
two-man operated loom which was more conventional. [33]:834 Cartwright built

two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers.
Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread
breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813. Horock's
loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large
numbers by Roberts, Hill & Co. [37]
The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United
States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could
be found to remove the seed. Eli Whitney responded to the challenge by inventing
the inexpensive cotton gin. A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as
much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one

pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process. [17][38]
These advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of
inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as Thomas Highs and John Kay; Arkwright nurtured the inventors,
patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the cotton mill which brought the production
processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then water power—which made cotton
manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twistingand spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of yarn increased greatly. Before long steam power was applied to drive textile
machinery. Manchester acquired the nickname Cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile
factories. [39]
Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could
not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in
India, which allowed high thread counts. However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades
of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry. [30]
Wool
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to
mechanize than cotton. Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant, but was far
less than that of cotton. [1][4]
Silk
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was John Lombe's water-powered
silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing
by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the
Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time
is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of
raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition. In order to promote
manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were
exhibited in the Tower of London.

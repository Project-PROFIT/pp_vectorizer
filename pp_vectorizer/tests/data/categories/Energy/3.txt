Foreword
European socio-economic research plays
a key role in providing policy-makers with
a substantiated scientific background. In
the field of energy, transport and environment, a scientific and rigorous analysis can
help to assess a renewable electricity target, an energy tax, a quantified objective to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, a state aid exception for clean
energies or a standard for energy efficiency.
The determination of the external costs caused by energy
production and consumption, i.e. the monetary quantification of its socio-environmental damage, goes in the
same direction. Indeed, external costs have to be quantified before they can be taken into account and internalised.This is precisely the goal of the ExternE (External
costs of Energy) European Research Network active
from the beginning of the Nineties. These multidisciplinary teams of researchers adopted a common methodology, conducted case studies throughout Europe and succeeded in presenting robust and validated conclusions.
Within this coherent framework, the
ExternE results allowed different fuels
and technologies for electricity and transport sectors to be compared. Policy
actions could therefore be taken to tax
the most damaging fuels and technologies
(like oil and coal) or to encourage those with lower
socio-environmental cost (such as renewables or
nuclear). The internalisation of external costs will also
give an impetus to the emergence of clean technologies
and new sectors of activity for research-intensive and
high added value enterprises.
European citizens want to live in a more sustainable
world.The consideration of external costs is one way of
re-balancing social and environmental dimensions with
purely economic ones.The assessment of externalities
answers a social demand and European research should
help to lay down the basis for improved energy and transport policies.

Foreword
Socio-economic research
in the field of energy
Decision-making in energy and environment calls increasingly for a better evaluation of the possible impacts of any
envisaged policy and measure such as a renewable electricity target, an energy tax, a quantified objective to
reduce greenhouse gases emissions, a voluntary agreement between public authorities and industries, a state
aid exception for clean energies, a standard for energy
efficiency or an internalisation of external costs.
Together with technological research which includes
hundreds of projects aiming at promoting new and clean
energy and environment technologies, improving quality
of life, boosting growth, competitiveness and employment,
socio-economic research in the Energy programme
helps to provide the scientific basis for energy and environment-related policy formulation. In particular by:
Socio-economic
activities
 The elaboration of scenarios for energy supply and
demand technologies and their interaction, and the
analysis of cost effectiveness (based on full life cycle
costs) and efficiency of all energy sources
 The socio-economic aspects related to energy within
the perspective of sustainable development (the impact
on society, the economy and employment)
The majority of energy socio-economic projects make
links between energy and environment and address the
issues of natural resources, economic growth and social
needs. Both market competition and environmental
constraints, top-down and bottom-up approaches are
considered.
Three crucial issues have largely been dealt within the
5th RTD Framework Programme with the aim of providing a substantiated scientific background and evaluation
tools for energy and environment policies formulation:
 The Energy-Economy-Environment models, which
explore different scenarios and give quantified information on potential future actions: the consequences of a
given CO2 target, the cost-effectiveness of such a
technology, etc.
 The climate change issue and particularly, beyond the
purely scientific problems, the socio-economic impacts
of the policies and measures taken: what are the
cheapest options to achieve Kyoto, what are the effects
of greenhouse gas emission trading, etc.
 The external cost evaluation or the measurement of
socio-environmental damages provoked by energy
production and consumption: what damages should be
included, what methodology should be used, which
comparisons could be made among technologies, etc.
Energy socio-economic activities in the 6th RTD
Framework Programme (2002-2006) will give
researchers the possibility of improving the assessment
of external costs (emerging technologies, adaptation of
the methodology, case studies in the Accession
Countries, new developments in traditional technologies)
and externalities in the broad sense (also including
questions on job creation and security of energy supply).

Definition of External Costs
The scope of the ExternE Project has been to value the
external costs, i.e. the major impacts coming from the
production and consumption of energy-related activities
such as fuel cycles. An external cost, also known as an
externality, arises when the social or economic activities
of one group of persons have an impact on another group
and when that impact is not fully accounted, or compensated for, by the first group. Thus, a power station that
generates emissions of SO2, causing damage to building
materials or human health, imposes an external cost.This
is because the impact on the owners of the buildings or
on those who suffer damage to their health is not taken
into account by the generator of the electricity when
deciding on the activities causing the damage. In this
example, the environmental costs are external because,
although they are real costs to these members of
society, the owner of the power station is not taking
them into account when making decisions.
There are several ways of taking account of the cost to
the environment and health, i.e. for internalising external
costs. One possibility would be via eco-taxes, i.e. by taxing damaging fuels and technologies according to the
external costs caused. For example, if the external cost
of producing electricity from coal were to be factored
into electricity bills, 2-7 eurocents per kWh would have
to be added to the current price of electricity in the
majority of EU Member States. Another solution would
be to encourage or subsidise cleaner technologies thus
avoiding socio-environmental costs. The recent
Community guidelines on state aid for environmental
protection explicitly foresee that EU member states may
grant operating aid, calculated on the basis of the external
costs avoided, to new plants producing renewable
energy. Besides that, in many other widely accepted
evaluation methods such as green accounting, life-cycle
analysis and technology comparison, the quantitative
results of external costs are an important contribution to
the overall results.
Another application is the use of external-cost estimates
in cost-benefit-analysis. In such an analysis the costs to
establish measures to reduce a certain environmental
burden are compared with the benefits, i.e. the damage
avoided due to this reduction.The value of this can then
be calculated with the methods described here.
Definition
Damages assessed
Seven major types of damages have been considered.The
main categories are human health (fatal and non-fatal
effects), effects on crops and materials. Moreover,
damages caused by global warming provoked by greenhouse gases have been assessed on a global level within
ExternE; however the range of uncertainty is much higher
for global warming impacts than for other damages.
avoidance costs to reach agreed environmental aims are
calculated as an alternative second best approach. The
costs for ecosystems are based on the political aim of
reducing the area in the EU where critical loads are
exceeded by 50%. For global warming, a shadow price
(i.e. like a virtual taxation) for reaching the Kyoto reduction targets is used.
In addition to the damage cost estimates, for impacts on
ecosystems and global warming, where damage cost estimates show large uncertainty ranges, marginal and total
The following table gives an overview of the health and
environmental effects currently included in the analysis

ExternE methodology
The impact pathway approach - and coming along with
this approach, the EcoSense model, an integrated software tool for environmental impact pathway assessment
- was developed within the ExternE project series and
represents its core. Impact pathway assessment is a
bottom-up-approach in which environmental benefits and
costs are estimated by following the pathway from source
emissions via quality changes of air, soil and water to
physical impacts, before being expressed in monetary
benefits and costs. The use of such a detailed bottom-up
methodology  in contrast to earlier top-down
approaches  is necessary, as external costs are highly
site-dependent (cf. local effects of pollutants) and as
marginal (and not average) costs have to be calculated.
An illustration of the main steps of the impact pathway
methodology applied to the consequences of pollutant
emissions is shown in the following diagram.
Methodology
Two emission scenarios are needed for each calculation,
one reference scenario and one case scenario.The background concentration of pollutants in the reference scenario is a significant factor for pollutants with non-linear
chemistry or non-linear dose-response functions. The
estimated difference in the simulated air quality situation
between the case and the reference situation is combined
with exposure response functions to derive differences in
physical impacts on public health, crops and building
material. It is important to note, that not only local damages have to be considered  air pollutants are transformed and transported and cause considerable damage
hundreds of kilometres away form the source. So local
and European wide modelling is required.
Regarding dispersion, with NewExt, not only atmospheric
pollution is analysed, but also pollution in water and soil.
Human exposure to heavy metals and some important
organic substances (e.g. dioxins), which accumulate in
water and soil compartments and lead to a significant
exposure via the food chain, is represented in further
models.
As a next step within the pathway approach, exposureresponse models are used to derive physical impacts on
the basis of these receptor data and concentration levels
of air pollutants. The exposure-response models have
been compiled and critically reviewed in ExternE by
expert groups.
In the last step of the pathway approach, the physical
impacts are evaluated in monetary terms. According to
welfare theory, damages represent welfare losses for individuals. For some of the impacts (crops and materials),
market prices can be used to evaluate the damages.
However, for non-market goods (especially damages to
human health), evaluation is only possible on the basis of
the willingness-to-pay or willingness-to-accept approach
that is based on individual preferences.The monetary values recommended in ExternE by the economic expert
group have been derived on the basis of informal metaanalysis (in the case of mortality values) and most recent
robust estimates.
In some cases where uncertainty is still large, avoidance
costs can be calculated, e.g. for ecosystem damages
resulting from acidification or for global warming damages. To complete the external costs accounting framework for environmental themes (acidification and
eutrophication) that have not yet been properly
addressed but are the main driving force for current environmental policy, a complementary approach for the valuation of such impacts based on the standard-price
approach is developed and improved. This procedure
deviates from the pure welfare economic paradigm followed in ExternE, but it allows to estimate damage figures
for ecological impacts complementary to the existing
data on impacts from the same pollutants on public
health, materials and crops (based on damage function
approach and welfare based valuation studies). The integration of this methodology and data into the existing
external costs framework is an important extension as it
also covers impact categories that could otherwise not
be addressed properly in ExternE. This will again improve
the quality and acceptance of the accounting framework.
To perform the calculations, a software package called
EcoSense is used. EcoSense provides harmonised air
quality and impact assessment models together with a
database containing the relevant input data for the whole
of Europe.
In general, dependent on the question to be answered,
the analysis is not only made for the operation of the
technology to be assessed as such, but also including
other stages of the life cycle (e.g. construction, dismantling, transport of materials and fuels, fuel life cycle).

Methodology
Applications
The ExternE methodology has been applied for a large
number of European and national studies to give advice
for environmental, energy and transport policies.
One of the first objectives of the ExternE programme
was to make a comparative evaluation of different
technologies and fuel cycles for electricity generation.
A decade of research has resulted in detailed set of data
for impacts from a wide range of fuels, technologies and
locations. They include:
 Fossil fuels: coal and oil technologies with varying
degrees of flue gas cleaning, natural gas, centralised
systems and CHP, orimulsion
 Nuclear: PWR, open and closed systems for fuel
provision
 Renewable: onshore and offshore wind, hydro, a wide
range of biomass fuels (waste wood, short rotice,
crops) and technologies
Applications
The application on transport externalities (road, rail, aircraft and navigation) focused on the specific requirements
of emission and dispersion modelling and the extension
and update of dose-response functions. In addition to air
pollution impacts, those from noise and accidents have
been analysed. Besides the estimation of marginal costs
of transport, aggregated costs can be calculated, e.g. those
which refer to the entire transport sector of European
countries. Moreover, several policy case studies and scenarios have been examined in different countries of the
European Union, e.g. the use of alternative fuels in city
buses or the introduction of electric or CNG-fuelled
vehicles.
Besides the different phases of the ExternE project itself,
the methodology developed within this project has been
used to support a large number of policy decisions and
legislative proposals, e.g. of Directorate-General for
Environment, such as to perform economic evaluations
of the:
 Draft directive on non-hazardous waste incineration
 Large combustion plant directive
 EU strategy to combat acidification
 Costs and benefits of the UN-ECE Multi-pollutant,
Multi-effect protocol and of proposals under this protocol (e.g. NOx and VOC control)
 Costs and benefits for the emission ceilings directive

recycling

Environment,Transport and the Regions
 Air quality guidelines on CO and benzene
 Environmental costs of lorries (a study to incorporate
environmental costs in vehicle excise duty rates in UK)
 Second NOx Protocol (for the UNECE Task Force on
economic aspects of abatement strategies)
Moreover, EcoSense has been adapted to other territories in the world, especially for China, Russia, Brazil and
Mexico.
For the transport sector, this methodology developed in
ExternE is applied in a broader context within the
European projects UNITE and RECORDIT.
Fair and efficient pricing of transport infrastructure use is
a fundamental aspect of developing a sustainable transport policy that takes account of the full social costs and
benefits of transport. The project UNITE (Unification of
accounts and marginal costs for transport efficiency) supply policymakers with the framework and state-of-the-art
cost estimates to progress this policy. This framework
integrates pilot transport accounts for all modes and
marginal costs, consistent with public finance economics
and the role of transport charging in the European
economy.
In RECORDIT (Real cost reduction of door-to-door
intermodal transport) a comprehensive methodology is
designed and validated for the calculation of real (internal
and external) costs of intermodal freight transport and
for the understanding of cost formation mechanisms. For
selected corridors external costs from direct emissions
as well as lifecycle emissions are calculated.
A project called ECOSIT applies the same methodology
to the evaluation of several innovative industrial
technologies outside the energy and transport sector.
The GARP II project and the GREENSENSE project
incorporate the methodology into the systems of national
accounting.
Applications
Comparison of damage costs per kWh for
coal, gas, nuclear and wind electricity
A comparative evaluation of fossil, nuclear and renewable
fuel cycles reveals a wide range of impacts from a wide
range of power generation technologies. Data illustrate
that the external costs of electricity generation differ
greatly, depending on fuel choice, technology and location.A short overview of some results is shown in order
to give an idea of the range of results, the underlying
parameters that influence the impacts and the assumptions to take into account for their interpretation.
Although the data have been generated with a common
methodology, it may be misleading to simply compare the
final results because:
 Results are by nature location and technology specific,
therefore no simple generalisations are possible
 Only subtotals are available, as not all impacts have
been assessed completely
 Assumptions and parameters included in the analysis
may be specific for the fuel cycle, technology or location
 Assumptions and parameters have changed over time,
reflecting the state of the art at that time
The comparison of results can be described as follows:
ExternE methodology has been applied to a wide range
of fuels, different technologies and locations. The overall
result is somewhat summarised in the picture, though
generalisation is not what ExternE is aiming at (in contrast, the site and technology-specificity is one of the
most innovating aspects of ExternE). In general, wind
technologies are very environmental friendly with

impact categories. Not every location is equally suited for
wind generation, and hence the variability in external
costs due to noise or other amenity impacts. Nuclear
power in general generates low external costs, although
the very low probability of accidents with very high consequences and the fuel cycle impacts are included. It is
also a technology with very low greenhouse gas emissions.There are dozens of different biomass technologies,
and depending on the care given on gas cleaning technologies, the biomass options can range from low to high
external costs. They generate very low greenhouse gas
emissions in their life cycle. Photovoltaics is a very clean
technology at the use stage, but has considerable life
cycle impacts.
Gas-fired technologies are quite clean, with respect to
classical pollutants, but their impact on climate change
depends strongly on the efficiency of the technology.
Newer combined-cycle technologies can also be categorised as generating average to low greenhouse gas
impacts. Coal technologies carry the burden of their very
high CO2 emissions, even for new, more efficient technologies, and in addition cause quite high impacts due to
the primary-secondary aerosols. Old coal-fired power
plants are also very high emitters of classical pollutants,
making them overall the worst available technology. For
nuclear, results are presented for a discount rate of 0%.
Results for an (alternative) discount rate of 3% are even
lower.

technologies to be implemented in some European countries) it should be

visual intrusion are difficult to value. Both impacts can be
minimised through planning and consultation. Impacts on
birds and animals are negligible when quantified. Human
accidents during construction, or due to collisions on sea,
are also very small, but can become relatively important
when emissions from the production of materials
decrease further.
this table, in addition to the damage cost estimates, avoidance costs are given for impacts on ecosystems (acidification and eutrophication) and global warming, where
damage cost estimates show large uncertainty ranges.
The costs for ecosystems are based on the political aim
(as stated in European Commission 1997) of reducing the
area in the EU where critical loads are exceeded by 50%.
For global warming a shadow price for reaching the
Kyoto reduction targets is used. Besides global warming,
health impacts is the most important damage category;
here especially the reduction of life expectancy due to
long term exposure with primary and secondary particles
causes the highest damage.

Comparison of damage costs between
transport modes
This section presents a comparison of costs for road and
rail transport 1. For this purpose, costs due to vehicle use,
vehicle production, fuel production and infrastructure use
are included. The costs are related to the load of a vehicle to facilitate comparison between modes. Of course
the load factors used are very important for the results.
Air pollution costs due to urban passenger transport 2

mate has an important influence on the population exposure, as illustrated by the peak values for Athens.
Petrol cars cause lower costs per passenger kilometre
compared to diesel cars, as they emit much less fine particles, leading to lower health impacts. On a passenger
kilometre basis urban buses perform better than diesel
cars due to their higher number of occupants. But for
instance in London, petrol cars cause less specific costs
than urban busses.

The following figures refer to marginal costs, except the
last one, which presents total costs. All marginal costs
presented refer to specific locations, illustrating the range
of costs in different countries locations. They are not to
be interpreted as typical values for the respective countries.
The next figure shows costs due to transport in extraurban areas. Due to a lower number of people affected
close to the road or rail track, the impact of tail pipe
emissions is reduced, leading to a lower total per passenger kilometre. As a consequence, emissions from the upand downstream processes (vehicle and fuel production
and infrastructure provision) gain in relative importance.
Vehicles of the public transport, i.e. coaches and trains,
cause lower costs per passenger kilometre due to the
higher number of occupants.Trains with electric traction
have no direct emissions; for them, the dominating
process is the electricity production. They cause by far
the smallest costs; the second best vehicle category is the
coach due to its high capacity use.
The range of transport externalities assessed has been
extended to impacts due to noise, accidents and congestion. A methodology consistent with the approach for

The method can also be used to

country. In the following figure,
Goods Train
damage costs due to air pollutants,
global warming, accident risks, and
noise caused by all transport modes in Germany have
been estimated. Quantifiable total costs for the year 1998
amount to ca. 33 billion for the transport sector. This
corresponds to 1.7% of that years gross domestic product.
Road transport takes the lions share; rail, aircraft and
inland waterway transport cause much lower costs. In
the road transport sector external accident costs are the
most important category, followed by air pollution, noise,
and global warming. Rail transport shows a good environmental performance except for noise costs, which
dominate the result for rail transport.
Heavy goods vehicle
Containership
Barge
in Germany. The highest cost per TEU-km is caused by
the heavy goods vehicle, mainly due to accident and air
pollution costs. The high air pollution costs for the containership are mainly due to the high NOx emissions.
Accident risk and noise impacts are very low for the containtership as well as for the barge. So air pollution and
global warming are the dominating cost categories. The
goods train considered causes comparably low costs due
to airborne pollutants (which are included in the category up- and downstream). The total costs split almost
equally between the cost categories accidents,up- and
downstream, global warming and noise. Please note
that the costs reflect the specific technologies actually
used for the transport task described. Other technologies may cause higher or lower costs.

Uncertainties and Reliability
The methodology is sometimes criticised by pointing at
the  large  uncertainties involved. But before discussing
these, one has to distinguish these uncertainties from
deviations of current results compared to earlier results
as well as from ExternE itself and from other publications.
Firstly there has been a substantial methodological development in the last ten years, e.g. from a top-down to a
site-dependent bottom-up approach or with regard to
the monetary valuation of health effects.Therefore, comparisons should include an analysis of whether the chosen methods are appropriate and state of the art, and
whether the studies are complete. Secondly, new knowledge, e.g. about health impacts, of course changes the
results. For example, the emerging knowledge that fine
particles can cause chronic diseases resulting in a reduction of life expectancy changed the results considerably.
An assessment always reflects current knowledge.That an
assessment changes with new knowledge  and also may
change due to a change in peoples preferences  is natural and not a methodological problem.
Uncertainties
Reliability
Individual sources of uncertainty then have to be identified and quantified. It is appropriate to group them into
different categories, even though there may be some
overlap:
 Data uncertainty, e.g. slope of a dose-response function, cost of a day of restricted activity, and deposition
velocity of a pollutant
 Model uncertainty, e.g. assumptions about causal links
between a pollutant and a health impact, assumptions
about form of a dose-response function (e.g. with or
without threshold), and choice of models for atmospheric dispersion and chemistry
 Uncertainty about policy and ethical choices, e.g.
discount rate for intergenerational costs, and value of
statistical life
 Uncertainty about the future, e.g. the potential for
reducing crop losses by the development of more
resistant species
 Idiosyncrasies of the analyst, e.g. interpretation of
ambiguous or incomplete information
The first two categories (data and model uncertainties)
are of a scientific nature and can be analysed by using statistical methods. Results show a geometric standard deviation of ca. 2 to 4 which means that the true value could
be 2 to 4 times smaller or larger than the median estimate. The largest uncertainties lie in the exposureresponse function for health impacts and the value of a
life year lost  current research is directed towards
reducing these uncertainties which reflect our limited
knowledge.
Furthermore, certain basic assumptions have to be made,
e.g. such as the discount rate, the valuation of damage in
different parts of the world, the treatment of risks with
large impacts or the treatment of gaps in data or scientific knowledge. Here, a sensitivity analysis should be and
is carried out demonstrating the impact of different
choices on the results. Decisions then would sometimes
necessitate a choice of the decision-maker about the
assumption to be used for the decision. This would still
lead to a decision process that is transparent and, if the
same assumptions were used throughout different decisions, these would be consistent with each other. If
uncertainties are too large, as currently still is the case
for global warming impacts, shadow values could be used
as a second best option. Shadow values are inferred from
reduction targets or constraints for emissions and estimate the opportunity costs of environmentally harmful
activities assuming that a specified reduction target is
socially desired.
Despite these uncertainties, the use of the methods
described here is seen to be useful, as
 The knowledge of a possible range of the external costs
is obviously a better aid for policy decisions than the
alternative  having no quantitative information at all
 The relative importance of different impact pathways is
identified (e.g. has benzene in street canyons a higher
impact on human health as fine particles?)
 The important parameters or key drivers, that cause
high external costs, are identified
 The decision making process will become more transparent and comprehensible; a rational discussion of the
underlying assumptions and political aims is facilitated
 Areas for priority research will be identified
It is however remarkable that despite these uncertainties
certain conclusions or choices are robust, i.e. do not
change over the whole range of possible external costs
values. Furthermore, it can be shown that the ranking of
e.g. electricity production technologies with respect to
external costs does not change if assumptions are varied.
Thus, the effect of the uncertainty of externalities
depends on the application. The key question is: what is
the increase in total life cycle cost to society if one makes
the wrong choice? A detailed analysis of this question in
a specific situation involves the probability distribution of
the total social cost for each of the options under consideration, to estimate the expectation value of the social
cost or the probability of making the wrong choice.
It should also be noted that gaps can be closed and
uncertainties reduced by performing further research,
e.g. further contingent valuation studies and epidemiological studies.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I use the numbers that I have found in ExternE
reports for further calculations?
Yes you can, provided you make a clear reference to the
source and you are aware of the assumptions made and
the uncertainties involved. It is also recommended to
check with the author or somebody from the ExternE
network whether these are the best and latest data. It has
to be noted that there are a lot of other studies that use
and build further on the ExternE data (see also the
National Implementation Report).
the most important changes relate to the quantification
of public health impacts from pollutants and the quantification of global warming impacts.
Although for some case studies numbers have been
upgraded, this is not a general rule, and there is no systematic upgrade of the numbers of older reports. A first
short-cut attempt can be made by using new numbers
per ton of emissions for the specific sector and country,
and emission factors.
Why are ranges of numbers often displayed?
Is external cost information only understandable
for economists?
Questions
No, external costs are based on a multi-disciplinary
approach involving a lot of different scientific disciplines
to quantify impacts from emissions and burdens from
energy use. These impacts are weighted using monetary
values - based on the willingness to pay concept - to
reflect the importance of these impacts for society. This
information can also be completed with other indicators
and used in e.g. a multi-criteria analysis.
Why are the ExternE numbers different from some
other scientific sources?
Some numbers may be based on avoidance costs, which
is a very different methodology. Most other studies use
a top-down approach analysis, which does not fully reflect
the marginal cost approach referring to an additional
plant or produced unit of electricity at a specific site.
Other studies are also based on a kind of impact pathway
approach, but may have used other models, assumptions
or inputs.Thus a detailed comparison would be required.
Can I compare numbers of the most recent studies
with those from older reports?
One has to be prudent in comparing the numbers,
because in some areas scientific understanding is changing fast and significantly, and this scientific development is
reflected into the ExternE numbers. As a rule of thumb,
There are two main reasons: to reflect variability in
nature, technology, etc. and to reflect uncertainty in our
knowledge. However, the ranges do not reflect changes
of the results over time due to growing scientific understanding.
Can the numbers be used for policy preparation,
even if you only give subtotals and uncertainties
are large?
Yes - although not as figures that have the same quality of
accuracy as data gathered from the official national
accounts. However, external cost data gained from
ExternE are useful for a quantitative comparison of magnitude with each other as well as with other data
expressed in monetary values, e.g. gross or net domestic
products (which is done in Green Accounting). Such a
comparison represents a trade-off ratio between marketed and non-marketed goods that is based on a consistent
(and widely accepted in economic theory) approach of
individual preferences and willingness-to-pay.
Numbers have indeed already been used in several policy
areas, such as economic evaluations of the draft directive
on non-hazardous waste incineration, the Large
Combustion Plant Directive, the EU strategy to combat
acidification, the National Air Quality Strategy, the
Emission Ceilings Directive, proposals under the UNECE
multi-pollutant, multi-effect protocol and many more
policies, green accounting research projects,
and air quality objectives.
Future Research Topics
Extending and Improving the Methodology
Epidemiology
The dose-response functions of ExternE must be updated to take into account the enormous amount of
research on air pollution epidemiology in recent years.
The assumptions of ExternE about the health effects of
the different types of primary and secondary particulate
matter should be re-examined.
Atmospheric dispersion
The ExternE models for atmospheric dispersion and
chemistry could be improved.
Sound propagation
The models for sound propagation could be validated and
improved.
Monetary valuation
Security of energy supply
The growth of energy demand in recent years, coupled
with the current political situation, raises the spectre of
new energy shortages.The security of supply implications
of different energy technologies should be examined.
Other positive externalities like jobs creation could
also be studied.
Data on traffic accident risks
Costs due to accident risks make a considerable share of
the total cost of transport externalities. But available
empirical evidence is still comparably poor for some key
factors such as the marginal risk caused by an additional
vehicle kilometre. These key factors should be further
examined to reduce uncertainties in the estimates.
New Applications
New contingent valuation studies are needed to improve
the monetary valuation of the dominant contribution to
the external costs (loss of life expectancy and chronic
bronchitis). For several potentially significant impacts
ExternE has not yet been able to calculate reliable damage costs, in particular for acidification and eutrophication, other ecosystem impacts, damage to cultural values,
reduced visibility, and impacts of transmission lines.
The difficulties lie not only in the monetary valuation. For
ecosystems, the estimation of physical impacts is problematic because the slope of the dose-response functions
is needed, whereas so far only thresholds are known. In
reality, there are usually no sharp thresholds but a gradual increase of damage with burden.To circumvent these
difficulties one can try valuation by experts who would
be asked to compare these impacts with the health damage costs that have been quantified.
New energy technologies
Validation of the methodology by experts
Further economic, especially industrial activities
Experts of the various disciplines involved in an impact
pathway analysis could be asked by means of questionnaires to assess the validity of the various assumptions
and calculations in their respective field of expertise.
Several other industrial processes outside of the energy
sector cause significant external effects as well, and the
potential of new and innovative technologies replacing
conventional processes is not only able to reduce factor
Energy technologies are evolving, and their externalities
should be reassessed periodically. Of particular interest
would be a life cycle externalities analysis of fuel cells,
including the impacts of hydrogen production. A new life
cycle externalities analysis is also appropriate for renewables, because the technologies have been improving and
their use is expected to increase.
New technologies in the transport sector
Vehicle propulsion technologies are evolving, internal
combustion engines are being improved and new systems
such as fuel cells and hybrid systems are approaching
market maturity. For this reason the externalities should
be reassessed. In addition, new transport technologies,
e.g. airship-based logistics services, are being developed
which should be assessed.
F u t u r e
Research
inputs and thus internal costs, but also external costs. In
addition to the singular pilot case studies examined in the
ECOSIT project that show the principal application of the
ExternE results to further industrial processes, there is a
growing need for these companies to have at hand a standardised decision-supporting instrument of its own for all
strategic product and process decisions affecting health
and environment. Such an instrument is helpful to meet
environmental regulations and obligations, but becomes
even more inevitable as companies of nearly all branches,
e.g. car producers, nowadays are increasingly confronted
with a strong awareness of their customers and shareholders regarding political correctness and environmental friendliness of the company and their products.
Transfer of results to policy
F u t u r e
Research
External costs can be internalised in a variety of ways, in
particular environmental regulations (e.g. limit values for
emission of pollutants), taxation or tradable permits.
To help policy makers to use the results of ExternE,
the implications for the economy should be studied,
including distributional effects and taking into account the
uncertainties.
Dissemination
Internet tool
The EcoSense software can be made available on the
Internet to enable others to carry out their own analysis
of externalities.
Stakeholder involvement
Stakeholders (utility industries, policy makers, environmental organisations, consumer groups, etc) will be asked
to react to the results of ExternE. Stakeholder involvement will be solicited by workshops and, more efficiently,
by electronic communication (Internet site and e-mail).

implementation of sustainable development. In Europe, especially from the Gteborg Council, a strategy has been
launched and the internalisation of external costs is becoming one common sustainable point.
The ten years ExternE (External costs of Energy) socio-economic energy research project (10 millions of Community
funding through the RTD Framework Programmes) has certainly played an important role in the assessment of the
health and environmental effects coming from the production and use of energy.
ExternE has not only been useful in terms of European awareness about the possibility to quantify - and therefore to
internalise - external costs, but particularly to provide a coherent and complete accounting framework for European
Union external costs for electricity and, partially, for transport sectors.
The multidisciplinary team of researchers has furnished a common scientifically agreed methodology and made enough
case studies to launch a concrete debate on the internalisation of external costs in Europe.

Formed in 1992 following the Rio Earth Summit, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy
(BCSE) is dedicated to promoting market-based approaches to reduce pollution and providing a
diverse, secure mix of energy resources. The BCSE is comprised of companies and industry trade
associations in the energy efficiency, natural gas, renewable energy, independent power and
electric utility industries. Our membership includes companies on the cutting edge of efficient and
environmentally sound fuels and technologies, such as natural gas, wind, solar and geothermal
power, combined heat and power, insulation and fuel cells. The BCSE advocates the
implementation of cost-effective programs and policies that recognize the environmental attributes
of various energy sources and reduce reliance on imported fuels. Sister organizations have been
formed in the European Union, United Kingdom and Australia.

Distributed Generation in a Changing World
The massive power outages that occurred in the United States and Italy in the summer of 2003 have
drawn attention to the fragility of electric transmission and distribution systems, even in the
worlds most advanced energy systems. Such outages are common occurrences in developing
countries where the power system failures are endemic. Transmission and distribution line losses
in developing countries often run as high as 20 to 30 percent due largely to inadequate maintenance
and investments in distribution systems. The financial viability of electric utilities in developing
countries also remains constrained by improper billing, lack of payment, unauthorized connections
and continued subsidies that often benefit customers who have the ability to pay.1
Over 1.64 billion people worldwide (99 percent of them in developing countries) live without
access to electricity. Four out of five of those are in rural areas2 and 80 percent are from South
Asia3 and sub-Sahara Africa.4 Even in Latin America, where total electrification is much higher at
86 percent, nearly half of those in rural areas still lack access to electricity.5 As the International
Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2002 notes, the lack of electricity exacerbates
poverty and contributes to its perpetuation, as it precludes most industrial activities and the jobs
they create.6
In an attempt to reduce energy costs, attract private capital and improve service, countries
throughout Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean began opening their electricity markets to
private investors in the 1990s.7 With the introduction of competition, governments started to
privatize state owned utilities, unbundle energy production and distribution and create independent
regulatory bodies. However, electricity reforms in these countries have advanced slowly and
unevenly and independent electricity regulators remain inherently weak.8 Despite the advances
made in Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, only 40 percent of the countries in the
region have begun to privatize existing generation or distribution assets.9 Further, many of those
countries that have restructured their electricity sectors, have failed to achieve the results desired
largely due to a lack of adequate competition, the poor financial state of the electricity sector, and
the inability of customers to pay the contracted tariff.10 In Brazil, the Dominican Republic and
Georgia, the government has even been forced to buy back failed privatized utilities.

Meanwhile, the continued deregulation of electricity markets in the U.S. and Europe, the energy
shortages that resulted from the wholesale competition in California in the late 1990s, the rise of
the digital economy (and the associated need for reliable power) and increasing local opposition to
the construction of new transmission lines have contributed to a rise in developed countries of the
use of distributed generation  electricity generation close to the point of use. Unlike conventional
central power plants that produce 100 to 1000 Megawatts (MW) or more of electricity, distributed
generation facilities are smaller, ranging in size from 10 watts (W) to 50 MW. Distributed
generation, often referred to as DG, includes everything from conventional diesel generators and
industrial cogeneration units to small solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Distributed generation can
be used for continuous power generation (either stand-alone or with grid backup); to power local
mini-grids; to provide standby power to run during power outages or peak periods when electricity
prices are highest; provide supplemental power to households; or to export power back to the
electricity grid, helping reduce congested and overburdened distribution systems. The increased
emphasis on distributed generation has also resulted from widespread advances in DG technologies
and concerns over the environmental and climate change impacts of traditional electrical generation
and distribution systems.11
In the coming 30 years, demand for electricity in developing countries is expected to increase at an
annual rate of 4.1 percent, nearly twice that of developed nations. Although rural populations
without electricity are expected to gradually decline, rapid urban population growth will place an
ever increasing strain on existing electrical generation, transmission and distribution systems.12 To
meet this growing demand, the IEA estimates that 2,382 GW of new electrical generation capacity
will be needed at a cost of $2.13 trillion. The IEA concludes that developing countries will also
have to invest in: (1) the extension of the electricity grid in urban areas; (2) mini-grids in mediumsized settlements; (3) decentralized installations providing thermal, mechanical and electric power
in rural areas; and (4) maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure.

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
With many developing countries struggling to make utilities economically sustainable and meet
increased energy demand, the time is right for governments to re-evaluate their energy strategies
and begin to take advantage of the possible benefits that DG can provide. New energy strategies at
the local level are needed that reflect actual market and social conditions. Greater use of DG can
help reduce peak loads and overall consumption, improve transmission and distribution reliability,
reduce energy sector emissions, boost income for businesses that sell electricity to the grid, create
jobs and broaden access to electricity in isolated areas where grid extension is uneconomical.
One of the challenges facing governments of developing countries, is how to increase access to DG
technologies and promote greater energy efficiency and conservation while still ensuring that the
existing electric utilities (many of which are financially unstable) remain viable and competitive.
Under current electricity market reforms, even in developed countries, the benefits of DG are
largely unrecognized. Among the barriers faced by DG include costly equipment requirements,
high connection fees, lack of grid access and lengthy approval processes. 13 In developing countries
the capital costs for new technologies is often very high, which often results in undeveloped natural
gas and DG project infrastructure (an essential component for DG growth). Renewable energy DG
technologies in developing countries either dont exist or are in their early stages of market entry
and local knowledge of such technologies is usually rudimentary. Price distortions and fossil fuel
subsidies also make renewable DG technologies less competitive.
Despite these challenges, developing country governments can begin to take a number of
regulatory and financial measures to help level the playing field for DG and increase access to
electricity in rural and urban areas. Governments can begin by standardizing technical and safety
requirements for DG. A second step is to devise uniform interconnection standards to lower
transaction costs for DG technologies and allow them to more fairly compete. Third, governments
can ensure that DG receives non-discriminatory access to the distribution system and the ability to
compete in the wholesale market for the provision of energy, reserve or ancillary services.14
Fourth, governments should explore allowing customers with excess power from DG power
systems to sell electricity back into the grid. The more access DG is provided, however, the more
complex its management becomes. Regulators will need to address ways to adopt fair pricing
systems that takes into account the grid-benefits of DG while fairly compensating utilities and
distribution companies for other costs resulting from DG. Other barriers, such as cumbersome
permitting and other regulatory requirements, including environmental impact issues, will also
need to be addressed.
Overcoming regulatory barriers is only part of the equation for increasing the use and application
of DG technologies. Governments must also take an active role to help create market opportunities
for the widespread adoption of DG through tax incentives and credits, buy-down programs, low
interest loans and guarantees, and public benefit funds for rural electrification. In doing so,
governments must take care to ensure that subsidies are directed at lowing capital costs and not
used to cover operating expenses. Finally, developing countries should support the development of
human capital and entrepreneurs. DG is not a cure all for developing country energy needs and
problems.
Nevertheless, with the right regulatory policies, incentives and government
commitment, DG can help expand access to energy and provide numerous other ancillary benefits
to developing countries.

Distributed Generation Applications and
Technologies
What is Distributed Generation?
Distributed generation is the generation of electricity near the place of use or close to the load
being served.15 Beyond this broad definition, there is no consensus on what constitutes distributed
generation. Some regulatory bodies limit the definition to electricity generation near the place of
use that is connected to the transmission or distribution system.16 The IEA defines distributed
generation as a generating plant serving a customer on-site or providing support to a distribution
network, connected to the grid at distribution-level voltages.17 Others limit the definition by size
or type of generation.18 For purposes of this publication, distributed generation includes electricity
generation or storage close to the point of use, including on-site generation that is connected to the
distribution grid or a mini or micro-grid.19
DG Applications
Distributed generation includes both fossil fuel and renewable energy technologies and can be used
for a variety of different purposes. For example, distributed generation can be a simple
independent power source used for back-up power or a complex system that is connected to the
electricity grid and involves electricity generation, energy storage and power management
systems.20 The following are some of the different DG applications:
1. Self-Sufficiency and Grid Independence. DG technologies can be used for continuous
on-site customer electrical power generation to meet all of ones energy needs with or
without grid connection. Grid connection is often desirable for backup power should the
DG technology fail or during maintenance outages. This also includes mini-grid
applications. Improved power quality and reliability are two of the primary drivers for onsite distributed generation. Off-grid, stand-alone power generation is also used for village
and rural power applications in areas that are difficult to access and not served by the
CAL. ENERGY COMM., DG STRATEGIC PLAN at 2. See also, Resource Dynamics Corp., at 28.
The California Energy Commission defines distributed generation as: electric generation connected to
the distribution level of the transmission and distribution grid usually located at or near the intended place of
use. CAL. ENERGY COMM., DG STRATEGIC PLAN at 2.
IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 10.
The Public Utility Commission of Texass Distributed Generation Interconnection Manuel defines
distributed generation and on-site distributed generation as: An electrical generating facility located at a
customers point of delivery (point of common coupling) of 10 MW or less and connected at a voltage less
than 60 kV, which may be connected in parallel operation to the utility system. PUBLIC UTILITY COMM. OF
TEXAS at A1-3.
This definition is similar to what the IEA defines as dispersed generation, distributed generation plus
wind power and other generation, either connected to a distribution network or completely independent of the
grid. IEA defines Distributed Power as distributed generation plus energy storage technologies such as
flywheels, large regenerative fuel cells, or compressed air storage; Distributed Energy Resources as
distributed generation plus demand-side measures; and Decentralized power as a system of distributedenergy resources connected to a distribution network. IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 19 and 20.
The California Energy Commission defines a micro-grid as: A micro-grid is a grouping of small-scale
generators that are owned and operated by energy users who are members of the micro-grid. The micro-grid
is operated entirely in the customers own interests and has only one point of interconnection with the utility
grid. CAL. ENERGY COMM., DG STRATEGIC PLAN at 15.

electricity grid.
2. Supplemental Power. On-site generation can be applied to augment power from the grid.
This can be out of the desire to provide standby or emergency power during grid outages.
DG can also be used to reduce the amount of electricity purchased during peak pricing
periods (peak shaving).
3. Net Energy Sales or Metering.
Customers who install distributed generation
(homeowners, businesses or entrepreneurs) that produce excess on-site power can sell their
surplus electricity back to the electricity grid, particularly during peak pricing periods.
This is often called net metering.
4. Combined Heat and Power or Cogeneration. Industrial processes or power generation
can use captured waste heat to enhance energy efficiency and help meet a customers hot
water, space heating or other thermal or cooling needs.
5. Overall Load Reduction. Supplemental DG power and other energy efficiency and
saving measures can also be used to reduce electricity consumption from the grid (demandside-management).
6. Grid Support. DG can also be used by power companies to reduce congestion during
high peak loads as a way to avoid having to invest in expensive line and sub-station
upgrades.21
DG Fossil Fuel Technologies
Fossil fuel technologies remain the primary source of distributed generation in both developed and
developing countries. The three primarily fossil fuel uses are: reciprocating engines, combustion
gas turbines, and micro turbines, with the later still in the development stage. Most fossil fuel
technologies run on natural gas or diesel. However, natural gas infrastructure is not always
prevalent in many developing countries and the gas often has to be imported. Many fossil fuel
technologies can have high emissions. Given the need for many countries to import fossil fuels,
some developing countries are beginning to experiment with indigenous fuels that use modified
combustion engines.
Reciprocating Engines
Reciprocating or internal combustion engines are the most widely used for DG applications, mainly
for standby or emergency power for small industrial or commercial customers. This is due to their
fast start-up time and wide availability.22 However, with high efficiency levels and low fuel costs,
reciprocating engines can also be utilized for continuous power applications. Reciprocating
engines include compression-ignited diesel and four cycle spark-ignited Otto engines.23
Typical efficiencies range from 25 to 36 percent, although large modern diesel engines that are
capable of running on heavy fuel oil or crude oil can attain electric efficiencies close to 50
percent.24 Newer reciprocating diesel engines are capable of substituting diesel with 89 to 90
percent gasoline or natural gas that emits fewer emissions. By recovering the heat from the

engines exhaust, approximately 70 to 80 percent of the fuels energy can be utilized.25 Average
cost is between $200 to $350/kW for normal reciprocating engines26 and $800 to $1,500/kW for
combined heat and power projects.27 Maintenance costs are $0.01 to 0.015/kWhr. Although
reciprocating engines are widely available, inexpensive, and efficient, they have high maintenance
requirements, and diesel units have a higher level of emissions.28
Combustion Gas Turbines
In OECD countries,29 gas turbines make up two-thirds of the 2000 orders of 20 GW distributed
generation systems. Half of the orders are for standby units, 40 percent for continuous use and 15
percent for peak capacity.30 Gas turbines range from 1 to 10 MW for onsite power generation, and
they can operate using natural gas, synthetic gas and fuel oils.31 Simple cycle efficiencies are
between 25 to 40 percent with newer combined cycle turbines. These combine a gas turbine with a
heat recovery steam generator  typically above 25 MW  achieving electric efficiencies around 60
percent. Capital costs range between $300 to $900/kW with average maintenance between $0.003
to $0.005/kWhr.32
Micro Turbines
Micro turbines are 25 kW to 250 kW turbine engines that run on natural gas, gasoline, diesel or
alcohol.33 Derived from aircraft auxiliary power systems and automotive designs, micro turbines
have one or two shafts that operate at speeds of up to 120,000 revolutions per minute for single
shaft engines and 40,000 rpm for duel shaft engines. Micro turbines are a relatively new
technology and are only now being sold commercially. They have capital costs of $500 to
$1,000/kW and electrical efficiencies of 20 to 30 percent.34 Their main advantage is their small
size and relatively low NOx and CO2 emissions. Main markets include light industrial and
commercial facilities that often pay higher prices for electricity.35 Their modest heat output can
also be used for low pressure steam or hot water requirements.36
Combined Heat & Power
Combined heat and power (CHP, or cogeneration) can produce substantial cost savings for
industrial and commercial users, providing an important source of additional electrical power, hot

water, low and high pressure steam consumption and cooling loads, while reducing energy
consumption and lowering emissions.37 Apart from electricity generation, steam turbines can also
be used to operate rotating equipment such as air or refrigeration compressors. In the state of So
Paulo, the natural gas utility is providing incentives for natural-gas powered CHP as a way to
increase market share.38
Industrial applications provide the greatest potential for CHP in agriculture, forest products, lumber
and wood products, paper and allied products, mining, glass, petroleum, chemicals and metals and
food processing.39 In a study of the U.S. market, the following sectors were identified as having
potential: colleges, universities and schools, district energy utilities, government, hospitals, solid
waste (using landfill gas and biogas from sewage treatment facilities), office buildings, apartments,
airports, prisons, supermarkets, nursing homes and warehouses.40 One advantage of combined
heat and power is that it can be used with a wide array of technologies, including fuel cells. Gas
turbines or reciprocating engines are the two primary technologies used for industrial, commercial
or institutional end users.41 Another source is biomass fuels, such as bagasse from sugar cane.
Box 1. Case Study: Sugar Mill Cogeneration in India42
With policy support and promotional assistance from the Indian Ministry of Non-conventional Energy
Source, the Indian Government, and USAID, state power boards began offering sugar mills 13-year power
purchase contracts at a competitive price of $0.06/kWh, and a 50 percent reduction in interconnection fees.
As a result, Indias sugar mills now produce and sell over 300 MW of electricity to state grids using a high
pressure and temperature cogeneration process with bagasse, a renewable fuel and byproduct from sugar
cane. An additional 400 MW surplus of exportable bagasse energy is in advanced stages of development
and over 3,000 MW is planned for year-round cogeneration. The total development potential for bagasse in
India is believed to be 5,000 MW. The benefits provided by Indias bagasse cogeneration program extend
far beyond the additional electricity generated. From 1999 to 2000, four sugar mills alone offset 359,000
tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The growth of electricity generation as a byproduct of sugar mills also
creates jobs, fortifies rural and local economies, and helps avoid further migration to overcrowded cities.
Economy of scale is important in CHP applications due to the amount of capital investment
required. The higher the utilization rate the more economical CHP becomes. In OECD countries,43
the capital costs to combine both power and heat production increase on average by 10 percent.
This may well be higher in developing countries due to the increased cost of capital. Nevertheless,
studies show that the additional costs are almost always recovered by the value of excess heat
energy produced, sometimes in as little as two to five years.44
One downside to CHP is that is it is very site specific due to the need for customers to use the
process heat.45 Because developing countries tend not to be highly industrialized, they also do not
have a large demand for the process heat, and where there is demand, it normally is in select

regions of the country. There is particularly little demand for process heat in rural areas.
DG Renewable Energy Technologies
Experiences with renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, small hydro
and fuel cells) in developing countries have been mixed. India and China have aggressively
promoted its development, with relative success. Nevertheless, many barriers continue to impede
its development. Foremost is the high up-front cost of renewables compared with fossil fuel
technologies. DG renewable technologies continue to be inhibited by fossil fuel and electricity
subsidies that do not reflect the true cost of generation and transmission. The intermittent nature of
some renewables  their dependency on the availability of wind, water, sun, or biomass resources 
may further limit their use. As a result, DG renewable technologies require the use of energy
storage devices, (usually batteries, which are expensive and require maintenance) or back-up
power, most often diesel generators. Renewable DG technologies normally require resource
assessments before installation and the provision of support services and replacement parts is not
always readily available.
There are, however, a number of benefits to renewables. Renewable DG technologies are not
subject to fossil fuel price fluctuations.46 Renewables in a DG context will often have an advantage
when applied in mini-grid or off-grid rural settings where power line extensions are too costly or
where line construction will take considerable time to complete. In China, for example, small
hydro and solar power have been successfully applied to run DG mini-grids. High peak energy
prices can also make DG renewable energy economically attractive. Renewables also emit less
pollution.
Solar Power
Solar energy is the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity using semiconductor materials
called photovoltaic (PV) modules, of which there are roughly 30 different types. Three are under
commercial production: monocrystalline modules are the most efficient; polycrystalline modules
are less efficient but less expensive to produce; and thin-film modules, normally used for running
consumer devices, are half as efficient as the best cells but far less expensive.47 Thin film PV
technologies offer the advantage of providing lightweight and unbreakable panels on flexible
substrates that can be integrated with the roof. Solar PV technologies can operate for up to 30
years, and are used worldwide. The global PV market is currently growing at a rate of
approximately 20 to 25 percent per year.48
PV solar systems range in size from 50 watts to one kW for stand-alone systems (usually with
battery storage) and 500W to five kW for grid-connected systems or larger remote water pump
systems. A five-kW PV solar system can serve a village of 50 to 80 households. PV modules can
also be integrated with diesel, wind and hydro systems and are cost-effective with other energy
sources today in remote areas without access to electrical grids. PV panels are used for charging
batteries in lanterns, village lighting, communications, refrigeration and water pumping. PV
modules typically cost between $2.50 to $3.00/watt.49 For example, solar home systems for
lighting and basic household uses in developing countries can be as low as $350 to install.
However, home systems have been slow to catch on, even for middle and upper income rural

generator, or to operate mechanical devices, such as water pumps.51 Small wind turbines range in
size from 900W to 50 kW. Wind power is a proven technology and is used in more than 30
countries. It is estimated that small-wind power is available in 75 percent of the world. China
alone has installed over 150,000 small wind turbines.52 The availability of wind speed data is vital
for determining the feasibility of wind projects. Although wind energy is intermittent, it is
nevertheless a predictable resource that can be integrated into the electrical grid or used in minigrid, often with other energy sources, such as solar or diesel generators.53 In remote locations,
variable speed wind turbines can be used to help stabilize distribution networks.54 Small wind
turbines with only two to thee moving parts are mechanically simple, rugged, reliable, and last up
to 50 years. They require virtually no maintenance and can be used off-grid for pumping and
treating drinking water, irrigation, telecommunications, homes, schools, clinics or for
supplementing larger village power systems. A village wind power system that provides up to 500
kWh per month ranges in cost from $15,000 to $25,000, with larger systems prices as high as
$150,000.55 A 7.5 kW wind turbine and battery charging station that supplies electrical power to
40 homes in Tomenas, in Timor costs each family approximately $2.40 per month.56
Biomass and Biofuels
Biomass energy comes from wood chips, aquatic plants, corn cobs and stalks, rice hulls, nut shells,
orchard prunings, alcohol, sugarcane bagasse and vegetable oils, and municipal and animal waste
(biogass). Biomass energy is produced either through direct combustion (usually solids in furnaces
or boilers), through anaerobic digestion (accelerating the natural conversion of biomass into
methane-rich biogas for use as a gaseous fuel), gasification (the physical or chemical conversion of
biofuels into secondary gaseous compounds used as a fuel), or chemical or biochemical conversion
(using yeast to decompose carbohydrates such as starches in grains, sugar cane juice or molasses to
produce methanol, ethanol or other liquid fuels).57
Biomass power plants range in size from four kW to as large as 50 MW and have tremendous
potential in developing countries. In India alone, Winrock International estimates that 19,500 MW
can be generated from fuel wood and crop residues and bagasse from the sugar industry.58
According to the World Alliance for Decentralized Energy (WADE), with the right tariff structure
bagasse has the potential to provide sugar mills around the world with heat and power and still be
able to export anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of the power generated. 59 The conversion of sugar

cane to alcohol in Brazil is beginning to compete with gasoline, although the countrys alcohol fuel
program has relied on substantial subsidies over the years. Biogass plants also require sufficient
space and a constant fuel source.60
Biomass is also an excellent source of power for remote village applications. A number of
commercial companies, including Ormat International and Community Power Corporation,
manufacture small stand-alone biomass units from 4 to 15 kW for village power applications.
Ormats new Biomass Fuel Power Unit E4V, for example, is a self-contained, fully automatic
power system that can be skid-mounted and operated by local farmers using various types of
biomass and agricultural residue.61 The Community Power Corporation has also developed a biopower battery charger that uses a gasifier to operate a free-piston Stirling engine generator. The
company is also working to develop systems that produce clean gas from biomass to power fuel
cells and micro-turbines. 62 As the following case study below demonstrates, innovative uses of
biomass crops, such as switch grass and plant extracts are increasingly being used as a replacement
for diesel fuel.
Box 2. Case Study: Village Power Using Biofuel in India as a Replacement for Diesel63
In the remote village of Chalpadi in the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh, oil extracted from the seeds of the local
pongamia pinnata tree is being used as biofuel to run an off-the-shelf diesel engine that provides power to a communityrun village electrification micro-grid. The town originally received the diesel engine from the Indian government as
part of its rural electrification program, but when the cost of diesel became prohibitive, the town turned to the idea
extracting oil from pongamia seeds as a source of fuel to power the generator instead of diesel.
Villagers now pay for the operation of the generator and their electricity by collecting the seeds needed to make the
biofuel. A womens self-help group responsible for the operation and maintenance of the engine levies a weekly tariff
of 7 kilograms of pangamia seed per family. In April 2003, the town of Chalpadi sold 900 tons of carbon-dioxide
equivalent verified emission reductions to Germany. The sale, which was facilitated by former World Bank economist
Dr. Emmanuel DSilva, fetched the community $4,164.00, equal to a years worth of income for every family in the
village.
The state government has plans to replicate the project in some 100 villages. In addition, the federal government of
India is actively encouraging biofuel production sources from pongamia and other oilseed-bearing tree species. The
next phase of the Indian project is to form womens associations that will produce the seed, process the biofuel, and use
the fuel to power irrigation pumps. The womans associations will then sell water to local farmers as a woman-owned
business enterprise.
Geothermal
Geothermal power uses the natural heat from the earths interior to drive a turbine generator and
produce electricity. Direct geothermal energy is used in 60 countries for commercial purposes,
such as agricultural (mainly greenhouse heating), aquaculture (fish pond heating) and industrial
processes.64 Although geothermal energy is generally not considered a distributed resource, as it
normally provides large base loads of up to 100 MW connected to the electricity grid, small
geothermal energy systems can be used for mini-grid applications. Smaller geothermal energy
plants of less than 5 MW are in use in China, Mexico and Thailand and have potential in Central
and Latin America, the Caribbean, East Africa and the Philippines.

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Small-sized units are readily available in 250 and 500 kW steam units.65 A 300 kW geothermal
power plant built by Ormat in Fang, Thailand not only generates electricity but also uses the spent
hot water to operate a cold storage house and a crop dryer. Costs for geothermal energy plants in
the 1 to 5 MW range are between $0.05 to $0.07/kWh, while smaller geothermal electrical systems
are higher, between $0.105 to $0.30/kWh. The cost of geothermal energy competes with that of
diesel in the 100 to 1000 kW size range.66 Unlike intermittent technologies, geothermal energy
provides constant power at 80 percent capacity or higher.
Small Hydro
Hydropower converts falling water into electrical energy or mechanical energy. The amount of
power provided by the falling water is a function of the vertical distance the water drops (the head)
and the volume of the water passing through the turbine. For example, 50 cubic meters of water
falling 10 meters (a low head application) represents the same energy potential as 10 cubic meters
of water falling 50 meters (a high head application).67 Brazil defines small hydro as 1,000 to
30,000 kW installed capacity, mini-hydro as 100 to 1,000 kW and micro-hydro as up to 100 kW.68
Small hydro systems require a turbine, generator, water-flow controllers and a structure to house
the equipment.69
Depending on its size, the construction of a small hydroelectric project can take between two to
three years at a cost of $1,000 to $5,000/kW, 45 percent of which is for equipment, 27 percent for
labor, 15 percent for development and 13 percent for infrastructure. Sites with a fast water flow
(high head) will usually require smaller and less expensive turbines and equipment. While most
hydroelectric projects use a storage reservoir to supply water to the turbine, run-of-river systems
capture the energy in the water by placing a special turbine in the river. Such systems are
susceptible to low water flow, however. Well-planned small hydro systems have minimal
environmental consequences and a project life of 20 to 30 years.70 The life-cycle cost of a small
hydro project is between $0.05 to $0.15 kWh. There are extensive opportunities for small hydro in
Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Fuel Cells
Power from fuel cells is created through an electrochemical process with (no moving parts) that
uses hydrogen (usually derived from natural gas) and oxygen to produce a DC current, heat, water
and carbon dioxide. There are presently four types of fuel cells being developed for electrical
power generation: (1) phosphoric acid fuel cells; (2) molten carbonate fuel cells; (3) solid oxide
fuel cells; and (4) proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Phosphoric acid fuel cells have a 40
percent energy efficiency and are presently on the market mostly in the 200 kW range. Molten
carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells produce high temperatures and have 60 percent
efficiency. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells operate at lower temperatures and are used for
small-scale operations.71
Fuel cell efficiency can reach as high as 85 percent with combined heat and power applications.
Fuel cell and gas turbine hybrid systems are also being developed (see hybrid discussion below).

The main barrier to fuel cells is their cost which range from $1,000 to $1,150 per kW with
operating costs estimated at $0.08 to $0.10/kWh. Fuel cells emit very low levels of nitrogen oxides
(NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) when hydrogen is
extracted from natural gas or other hydrocarbon fuels.
Hybrid Energy Systems
Hybrid power systems are those that use more than one generation technology. CHP systems,
discussed above, are but one example of hybrid systems. Hybrids can include any combination of
renewable and fossil fuel generation technologies or different renewable sources, such as wind,
solar and small-hydro, which are normally combined with battery storage. Hybrid systems are
capable of providing reliable grid quality AC power sufficient to support standard appliances,
such as refrigerators.
One hybrid system under development is the use of fuel cells and gas turbines. These highly
efficient systems eventually will be able to produce 30 MW or more of electrical power at a 70
percent efficiency.72 Because wind and PV solar power systems are intermittent, hybrid systems
can allow one technology to distribute power when the other is idle. For example, wind or minihydro and solar PV modules often have seasonal compatibility. During summer months there is
generally less wind and water but lots of sun, while in the winter there tends to be more wind and
water and less sun.73 For low load applications, a small 1.2 kW wind/solar hybrid system capable
of producing between 3 to 5 kWh per day can be installed by two people in less than a day at a total
cost of approximately $5,900.74 These systems are easy to ship and can operate in adverse terrain.
Villages throughout the world run diesel generators for three to six hours a day, providing
electricity only during evening hours. Wind/diesel or Wind/solar/diesel hybrid systems, however,
can provide electricity 24 hours per day and are ideal for village mini-grid applications. Existing
diesel mini-grid systems, for example, can be retrofitted with larger size AC type induction
generator wind turbines. Typically, renewable energy in a hybrid system will supply between 60
and 80 percent of the energy with diesel generators running as little as 10 percent of the time. One
downside to such systems is the necessary watering of the battery banks, which represents an
operational burden.75
The Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributed
Generation for Developing Countries
Distributed generation offers a number of different benefits for power consumers, generators,
distribution companies, independent power producers and society as a whole. For one, it offers
consumers more efficient, reliable and flexible power at a reasonable cost. In addition, it can
provide utilities and distribution companies with a number of ancillary services, such as reduced
congestion and lower transmission and distribution losses.76 However, there are also technical and
safety issues associated with DG technologies that negatively impact utilities.77

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Off-Grid Remote Applications
One area where renewable DG technologies can excel is in rural applications where consumption is
low and the distance to the nearest distribution center is high. Most off-grid opportunities for
distributed generation are in Africa, Asia and select areas in Latin America, with Asia accounting
for largest off-grid population. Deciding between grid connection and the use of DG technologies
depends on a variety of technical, managerial and economic considerations that must be evaluated
on a case by case basis.78 Recent studies conducted by the World Bank suggest that a majority of
off-grid populations can be served most economically through grid extension.79 Nevertheless,
much depends on the load requirements of a given area and the cost of expanding transmission and
distribution lines. As Table 2 below indicates, these costs can vary considerably, ranging anywhere
from $40 to $2,000 per kW of new peak load with a wide gap between rural and urban systems.80
For example, solar power in Kenya has been found to be more economical than grid-supplied
electricity when located 9 kilometers or more from the electricity grid.81 Similar figures exist for
Nepal. Other studies have shown solar and the adoption of energy efficiency measures to be costeffective when compared with extending residential lines as little as  mile.82

Because consumption levels in rural areas are often low with the primary use being for lighting,
DG technologies are often initially the most appropriate option. DG home systems or mini-grids in
rural areas can be very attractive, particularly when there is a low electricity load requirement. A
recent comparison between the cost of providing low load electrical services through an 80
kilometer extension of the grid to a rural population center versus using distributed solar home
systems, found that the break-even point was slightly above 7,000 customers.84
Even when grid extension is determined to be the most cost effective or appropriate given a
populations electrical power needs, DG technologies may still be an interim solution that can be
rapidly applied. This is particularly true for critical services such as water pumping and
purification, healthcare, lighting, telephone, computer and internet services. Once the grid is

extended, distributed generation technologies can be moved and re-used elsewhere.
The use of distributed generation in remote areas also has the added advantage of enhancing the
quality of rural life.85 According to the World Bank, the benefits of decentralized energy are often
under-counted.86 The World Bank notes that the economic benefits of electricity may be difficult
to measure on the basis of the cost of substitutes. For instance, because electric lighting provides
an order of magnitude improvement over lighting from candles and kerosene, electric light is much
more than a simple replacement for kerosene.87 Distributed generation can reduce the time
women and children spend collecting water and improve health through water treatment devices
and the electrification of clinics.88 Access to electricity helps improve security, allow participation
in community and school activities and extend work hours. It also helps improve a communitys
access to information and promotes a sense of being part of the modern world.89
Studies show that rural electrification by itself does not necessarily trigger economic development
unless other prerequisites of sustainable development exist, such as markets for farm produce,
transport infrastructure, education, skilled labor and communication services.90 The one exception,
however, is the use of electricity for pumping water for irrigation that often leads to agricultural
growth and improved food security.91 Distributed generation is particularly suited for water
pumping applications. Other examples of productive DG applications include the use solarpowered lighting in India for pest control and micro-hydro in Nepal for grinding grain.92
Consumer Benefits
Increased Power Quality, Greater Flexibility and Lower Costs
Voltage fluctuations in the electricity grid and blackouts are responsible for large economic losses
and increased production costs for goods and services.93 Even in advanced grids, such as in the
United States, there are widespread surges, swells and transients that hurt sophisticated controls,
sensing, communications and computing equipment. In developing countries, these power swings
are even more extreme, negatively impacting industry, healthcare providers and businesses that
rely on computers and require high quality power.

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
In response to the poor power quality and high costs, households, apartment complexes and
companies in developing countries are increasingly resorting to distributed generation to provide
uninterrupted or standby emergency power to protect them against the risk of power outages and
avoid high electricity prices.94 In many instances, distributed generation can help bring down the
cost of electricity when one takes into account true delivery costs and line losses.95 Self-generation
in developing countries accounts for 13 percent of all power generated. The percentage of self
generation in Africa is even higher, equaling 25 percent of all electrical power.96
Flexibility is another important attribute of distributed generation.97 When DG is readily available
it can respond rapidly to inadequate distribution of electrical power and fuel price fluctuations.
Newer generators can also operate using multiple types of fuel, including fuels generated from biogasification98 (see section on Biomass energy below). DG can also be deployed by a wide range of
market participants from end-use customers and businesses to utilities and energy service
companies.99
Reduced Demand and Peak Shaving Benefits
Distributed generation can be operated to reduce energy consumption, shave peak power demand,
or both.100 In liberalized electricity markets, large customers often pay time-of-use rates where the
energy charge varies according to season (e.g., summer has higher electricity demands than
winter), time of day (mid morning to late afternoon is more expensive) and to the day of the week
(workdays are more expensive than weekends or holidays).101 Particularly during peak periods,
distributed generation can be used to hedge against volatile prices. In many instances, DG
technologies may be cheaper than peak time-of-use rates.102
Grid-Side Benefits and Costs
Siting, Planning and Construction Benefits
Distribution systems in many developing countries are already capacity-constrained. With 95
percent of population growth over the next 30 years destined to take place in urban areas, there is
an urgent need to boost power and upgrade and expand distribution lines. System upgrades in
urban areas, however, require much greater investment per kilowatt than more standard generation
To ensure a smooth transition from grid power to on-site power generation, electric storage and switching
equipment is used. CAL. ENERGY COMM., DG STRATEGIC PLAN at 2. For example, industries with
continuing manufacturing processes (chemicals, paper and others) or that provide essential services (banks,
telecommunications, data storage and retrieval, hospitals, grocery stores) increasingly depend on reliable
uninterrupted power supply. IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 48-49.

and transmission improvements. 103 Engineering solutions based on the central power plant model
can also take years to design and install. Small DG systems can take between six and 18 months to
plan and install compared with an average of three to five years for a large independent gas power
plant.104 Strategically placed, distributed generation can not only provide additional power but also
prolong the life of overburdened distribution systems, thereby avoiding the need for costly
upgrades. The modular nature of DG technologies and the relative speed with which they can be
deployed means that they can be brought on line quickly and incrementally as the population
grows.105
Increased Reliability
Greater use of distributed generation can also increase the reliability of the electricity grid. When
numerous sources of distributed power generation are connected to the electricity grid the impacts
of one or more of the DG systems failing has less of an overall impact on the entire system.
Similarly, the ability for DG to sell power to other consumers in the same distribution network also
increases its value and allows utility customers to contract for backup power.106
Transmission and Distribution Benefits
The IEA estimates that the loss of electricity from transmission and distribution lines world-wide in
1999 equaled 9.5 percent of the total global electricity supply.107 Transmission losses in
developing countries are much higher, ranging from 12 percent in the Philippines, to 20 percent in
Cameroon and Zimbabwe, and to as high as 32 percent in Nigeria.108 Transmission and distribution
of electricity account for 30 percent of the cost of electricity in OECD countries and 40 percent of
the costs for small household consumers.109
Because distributed generation is located close to the end-user (either connected to the electricity
grid or as stand-alone power), it can avoid or reduce transmission and distribution costs and free-up
space on congested distribution systems.110 For example, when strategically placed along the
distribution system near large loads, DG can reduce distribution line losses by lowering power
demand. The reduction in transmission system congestion can at least temporarily reduce the need
to upgrade transmission and distribution systems.111 DG generation can also raise the voltage in
the network, thus enhancing stability and improving the overall quality of the energy supply.112

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
The export of electricity to the grid during peak periods is not only beneficial to the distributed
generator but to energy service providers that are relieved from having to generate and distribute
high cost power. In Mexico, high tariff rates have encouraged the supply of DG power to private
consumers during peak hours. While the program has been successful in helping reduce
congestion, one downside has been in the inability of the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission
to control the amount of DG power provided into the system. Another issue is that almost all the
power has come from diesel generators with no pollution controls.113
Utility Considerations
One drawback to the grid-side benefits of DG is that they are very location specific and difficult to
measure and quantify. Utilities and distribution companies tend to view customer-side DG with
skepticism, seeing it as a temporary solution. Utilities contend that for grid-side benefits to be
meaningful they must be incorporated into long-term planning for transmission and distribution
systems. Because utilities are responsible for system reliability they argue that they have control
over DG equipment, either through contracting or direct dispatch control (the ability to switch
systems on and off).114
In addition, not all of DGs end results are positive. In some instances utilities must install
equipment to handle reverse power flows from DG electricity exported to the grid.115 The export of
power from remote distributed generation locations can also lead to losses in the distribution
system.116 Similarly, while the rise in voltage from adding electricity to the network can be
beneficial, it can also require connections at higher voltages or transformer upgrades to improve
voltage control. In Denmark, for example, a substantial increase in distributed generation reduced
loading on 132kV and 150 kV transmission systems but required the expansion of high-voltage
systems (400 kV).117
The connection of DG to the electricity grid also raises technical, safety, power quality and
dispatch issues (see section 4 below). While the use of DG for self generation or to meet peak
power demand will have little impact on the electricity grid, the more DG power that is dispatched
into the distribution system the greater the operational complexity for utilities and distribution
companies.118 Another issue is the ability of the utility to rely on DG power when it is needed.
Bagasse cogeneration, for example, is only available at certain times of the year (e.g., during sugar
processing after harvest). Even with the addition of DG power, utilities may decide that they have
to add new capacity to ensure a reliable power supply.
The interconnection of DG equipment to the grid also raises questions regarding the appropriate
costs for providing electricity to augment DG loads or backup power during DG equipment
failures, or for the export of DG power back into the electricity grid. An Arthur D. Little White
Paper notes that Transaction costs per unit of energy could also increase from DG market activity
and settlements, since they are generally dependent on the number, rather than size, of
Adding electricity to the network normally causes the voltage to rise which is a benefit when there are low
voltage levels. IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 73-74, 94.

transactions.119 Another factor is the loss of revenue by the utility. Most utilities view DG as
competition and are opposed to seeing their customer base eroded. Governments may also have
concerns over lost utility revenues that must be recovered either through a tariff increase or a
subsidy from the government (i.e., from taxpayers). The issue of revenue loss for developing
country utilities is particularly important as many utilities are already financially unstable. Lost
revenue may not be an issue if the utility can sell its power to other customers or if DG is installed
to meet excess demands that the utility would otherwise not be able to meet. But even when a
utility is able replace a customer, the new customers may not be equally credit worthy.120
Environmental Impacts, Access to Finance and Economic
Considerations
Environmental Impacts
Distributed generation also raises important environmental issues. Fossil fuel DG technologies, for
example, emit varying levels of emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfer dioxide (SO2),
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter (PM-10) and unburned hydrocarbons. DG can
also have noise, visual and land use impacts, particularly when used in densely populated urban
areas.121 In India, for example, the most common use of DG has been on diesel generators, which
are highly polluting.122 Similarly, other fossil fuel DG technologies, including gas turbines, are
unable to compete environmentally with the low emissions levels from large combined-cycle
natural gas fired plants with state-of-the-art pollution control technology.
Proponents of DG note that distributed generation rarely displaces only one technology, such as
natural gas.123 They contend that since DG tends to displace a mix of new and existing power
generation with higher average emissions, environmental benefits are usually obtained.124
Gradually, developing country governments are becoming more sensitive to regional and global
environmental concerns and are increasingly acknowledging the need to diversify their energy
resources.125 An important question for policy makers is how to reduce the use of more polluting
DG technologies and promote cleaner renewable DG technologies that are almost always more
expensive.
DG Finance and Access to Local Capital
Securing financing for energy projects in developing countries is no easy task and is one of the
major barriers to its development. Following the demise of Enron, many international energy
companies sold their foreign energy assets in developing countries and have limited their overseas
investments. When private investment is made, it normally occurs in power generation and not
transmission and distribution, and often requires a 20 percent or higher return on investment due in
part to the high level of risk. Moreover, foreign direct investment is not equal for all nations. For
example, Africa and South Asia only receive one quarter of all foreign investment in energy.126

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
One reason is that distributed generation projects generally have higher upfront capital costs
($/kW) and production costs ($/kWh) than larger central power plants, due to their smaller size.
For DG renewable technologies, a higher ratio of capital costs to operating costs also requires long
term financing at reasonable rates.127 In most developing countries financiers are less familiar with
DG renewable technologies, project developers often lack extensive project experience and
renewable technologies and therefore lack a successful track record that Banks can point to. All of
this results in higher completion and operating risks, which increase the cost of capital.128
While the financial challenges size will continue to be an impediment, because of their size DG
projects in developing countries may be better positioned to access domestic capital markets, while
larger central power projects will almost always need some international finance.129 A case in
point is Java and Bali in Indonesia, where disputes have flared between the government and
independent power producers. As a result, international lenders and even multilateral agencies,
such as the Asian Development Bank, have stopped investing in Indonesias power sector. It is
estimated that Indonesia needs $28.5 billion in investments by the year 2010 just to keep up with
electricity demand.130
With, the state-owned power company, PLN, cash-strapped and unable to finance new projects, the
government is turning to distributed generation from the private sector to help alleviate power
shortages. There is 6,800 MW of captive power available from companies that were forced to
build their own generation plants in the early 1990s to meet their need for consistent power. The
government is also initiating an aggressive demand-side-management campaign to reduce
consumption. Meanwhile, domestic banks are beginning to show increased interest in investing in
the countrys power sector due to the high demand.131
Economic Benefits
Greater use of distributed generation can have a positive impact on developing country economies
and employment.132 Central station power generation is one of the most capital intensive
industries. Nevertheless, it is also one of the least labor intensive. The expansion and growth of
DG technologies can help create manufacturing and energy service jobs.133 Aggressive government
support for renewable technologies in India in the late 1990s led to a rise in domestic wind-turbine
manufacturing, mainly through joint ventures with foreign partners.134 Expanded use of DG, such
as cogeneration from bagasse in India and Brazil, has made their sugar industries more efficient
and brought in extra revenue through the sale of excess electricity to the grid (see India bagasse
case study above).
Since most distributed generation technologies rely in some form on fossil fuels, their overall
impact on diversification fuel supply will be very limited.135 Nevertheless, greater use of combined

heat and power results in lower fossil fuel consumption, and renewable DG technologies, such as
photovoltaic cells, wind, biomass, geothermal and small-hydro, can help reduce dependency on
natural gas, even if in relatively small quantities.136 Because renewable energy DG is locally
available, it is not subject to price and supply fluctuations as is the case with fossil fuels.137 Since
most developing countries must import their fossil fuel, increased use of renewable technologies
can help keep local currency in the country and lead to improved balance of payments.138
Distributed Generation Regulatory and Policy
Considerations
Key Policy Issues Facing Distributed Generation
The barriers facing distributed generation, particularly for smaller projects, have been well
documented in the U.S. and elsewhere. Financial barriers resulting from higher capital and upfront costs are but one. A study undertaken by the U.S. Department of Energy and National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) distributed generation projects also found three other
barriers to be prevalent: technical, business-practice and regulatory.139 These barriers included
costly equipment requirements, high connection fees and lengthy approval processes that often
prevented smaller distributed generation projects from being developed. Box 3 below provides a
ten-point plan prepared by NREL to reduce barriers to DG deployment.

Technical Barriers
1. Adopt uniform technical standards for interconnecting distributed power to the grid.
2. Adopt testing and certification procedures for interconnection equipment.
3. Accelerate development of distributed power control technologies and systems.
Business Practice Barriers
4. Adopt standard commercial practices for any required utility review of [DG grid] interconnection.
5. Establish standard business terms for interconnection agreements.
6. Develop tools for utilities to assess the value and impact of distributed power at any point on the grid.
Regulatory Barriers
7. Develop new regulatory principles compatible with distributed power choices in both competitive and utility
markets.
8. Adopt regulatory tariffs and utility incentives to fit the new distributed power model.
9. Establish expedited dispute resolution processes for distributed generation project proposals.
10. Define the conditions necessary for a right to interconnect.

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
The challenge for policy makers is how to formulate a workable regulatory and policy framework
that values the benefits of distributed generation and reduces industry, market and economic
barriers to development while still protecting the grids infrastructure and ensuring that new power
sources do not threaten the financial viability of existing facilities.141 Even though developing
countries are at different stages of electricity reform, there are a number of measures that can be
taken to promote greater use of distributed generation. See Appendix 2 for a useful list of policy
and regulatory questions pertaining to the promotion and use of distributed generation.
Performance, Safety and Maintenance Interconnect Issues
Distributed generation involves both physical and market interface issues.142 Physical interface
issues include questions regarding safety, protocols, system impacts, reliability, standards and
metering.143 There are three ways in which distributed generation physically interfaces with the
electric utility: (1) parallel operation  when a DG facility provides some or all of its required
power while connected to the utility distribution system or exports excess generation back to the
utility; (2) momentary parallel operation or closed transition switching  when a distributed
generator operates in parallel with, and synchronized to, the utility long enough to ensure a smooth
transition from the utility (normally one second or less); and (3) isolated operation  when the
distributed generator does not operate in parallel with the utility.144
Any time an entity is connected to the electricity grid, system integrity, reliability and safety issues
arise. To be connected to the grid, a control system on the distributed generator is required for the
dispatch of electricity along with a communication system to initiate start-up in real-time. The
control system can be operated by the customer, retail company, distribution company or an
independent systems operator. Electricity markets and interconnect standards were not originally
designed to accommodate the connection of small DG to the grid. Interconnect standards and
procedures were originally developed within the context of a vertically integrated and regulated
monopoly structure and applied only to large customized DG installations ranging from 5 to 50
MW.145 To this day, utilities tend to deal with distributed generation on a case-by-case basis. The
technical and regulatory requirements applied to DG are often complex, time consuming and
costly. Nevertheless, utilities and distribution companies are often reluctant to simplify these
processes due to safety and reliability concerns.
Interconnect Procedures and Agreements
In the U.S. a number of states have sought to overcome technical barriers to distributed generation
by adopting pre-certification standards for certain DG equipment, thus ensuring adequate
performance and safety.146 The U.S. Department of Energy, working under the auspices of the

Interconnection Manual at A2-10 citing The Public Utility Commission of Texas Rules 25.212 (g),
Technical Requirements for Interconnection and Parallel Operation of On-Site Distributed Generation.
Arthur D. Little, Inc. at 13.
The states of California, Texas and New York have developed standards and procedures to address
technical and safety issues pertaining to distributed generation.
Business Council for Sustainable Energy
Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), is developing a Draft Standard for
Distributed Resources Interconnected with Electric Power Systems (IEEE P1547). Draft 11 of
P1547 was passed by IEEE in June 2003. The final standard will address conditions necessary for
the operation, testing, safety and maintenance of interconnected distributed resources. Standards
make it easier for DG users and equipment manufactures to obtain swift review and compliance.
California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Texas have also developed their own DG
interconnection standards. The Public Utility Commission of Texas and the California Energy
Commission have both published DG interconnection manuals with technical and safety
requirements, application forms, pre-certification requirements, and, in the case of California, a
database of certified equipment.147 Texas and California also use model interconnect agreements.
Standard interconnect procedures and agreements have also been developed by the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners148 and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.149
The resolution of interconnect issues is critical because it establishes technical ground rules and
credibility for distributed generation in the subsequent phases of policy development.150 The first
step in designing such a policy is to develop technical and safety requirements that address quality
issues, disconnect switches, minimum power factor requirements, and metering, monitoring and
telemetry requirements.151 A second step is to devise uniform interconnection standards and
procedures to lower transaction costs. As in the case of Texas, rules and procedures should specify
the pricing for transmission and distribution services and tariffs for back-up power, and set time
limits for processing applications. Rules should also provide for dispute resolution procedures.152
Finally, on-site equipment testing procedures to verify compliance with the technical requirements
should also be established by the appropriate regulatory commission.
Market Access and Structure
With streamlined interconnection procedures, regulators can decide under what terms and
conditions DG will be allowed access to the electricity grid, and how to meter and pay for such
access. In a vertically integrated electricity market, distributed generation either displaces
electricity from the grid or exports electricity back to the grid. Normally, this involves a long-term
contract with the utility that includes special charges for backup power, ancillary services and the
exported electricity.153

Energy Comm., California Interconnection Guidebook.

interconnection agreements and procedures for large generators (FERC Order RM02-1-000), and a proposed
rulemakings for small generator interconnection agreements and procedures (FERC Order RM02-12-000).

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Treatment of DG in a liberalized wholesale electricity market is not much different than under a
regulated monopoly.154 In Texas, for example, owners of DG can sell electricity to the utility at
wholesale, but not to other end-users. The price for power is determined through a negotiated
contract.155 Electricity market liberalization exposes generators and consumers to variable
electricity prices and generally encourages more economically efficient generation. In developed
countries, this is normally due to short construction lead times, low capital costs, flexibility in
operation and ability to expand output.156
Nevertheless, wholesale liberalization by itself does not ensure that DG receives nondiscriminatory access.157 In his article, Electricity Sector Reform in Developing Countries:
Implications for Renewable Energy, Dr. Keith Kozloff, formerly of Hagler-Bailly (now PA
Consulting) notes that: Compared with long-term power purchase agreements based on full costs
incurred over a projects life, spot generation markets weaken the incentive to invest in distributed
renewables whose costs must be covered over a period of several years.158 In many developing
countries increased privatization and liberalization of the electricity market has resulted in shorter
power contracts, increased borrowing costs and the need to obtain higher rates of return.159 A
recent report released by the New England Demand Response Initiative concludes that significant
market barriers to cost-effective active load management [which includes the use of distributed
generation] and energy efficiency investments will remain, even in conditions of active wholesale
competition.160
Government intervention is needed to ensure that rules and procedures provide DG fair and nondiscriminatory access to the distribution system and improve the ability to compete in the
wholesale market for energy, reserve or ancillary services.161 Wholesale market trading rules also
should be designed to facilitate greater participation by smaller generators in such markets.162 DG
proponents also argue that in order for them to be economically efficient, retail markets should be
liberalized to allow DG energy producers and customers direct access (also known as retail
wheeling or customer choice) through the distribution system.163

was supposed to open markets and opportunities for distributed resources, form the perspective of these
resources, power sector restructuring has been more like sector destructuring. Breaking the industry into
separate entities subject to different jurisdictions has made it harder for distributed resource vendors and
users to see the full value of distributed resources. Id.
IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 105-107. An important consideration for regulators in a debundled
electricity market (where generation, transmission, distribution and retail services are separated), is whether
to allow distribution companies to own and operate distributed generation facilities (thereby becoming a
power generator). Distribution companies in the U.S., for example, are experimenting with using distributed
generation to provide ancillary services. Proponents argue that distribution companies are the best suited to
identify where distributed generation can be used to the benefit of the customer and the distribution network.
Others fear that allowing distribution companies to be allowed to have ownership of distributed generation
might give them additional market powers and access to customers. One option is to allow distribution
companies the right to solicit bids for distributed generation within its system. Arthur D. Little, Inc. at 8-9.

Business Council for Sustainable Energy
Under direct access or retail wheeling, electricity that is owned by a power supplier (DG or
otherwise) is sold to a retail consumer over transmission and distribution lines owned by a third
party. A wheeling fee is charged by the owners of the lines for the use of the transmission and
distribution system. A special committee on distributive generation in India recommends that
wheeling prices should be related to reasonable levels of transmission and distribution losses of
the State Electricity Boards while ensuring that the Boards do not incur financial losses. Direct
access provides consumers with additional power supply options and creates more competition for
power producers.
Given that market liberalization in most developing countries is still in its early stages, DG grid
access will likely operate in a more regulated context, at first through contracts with the utility or
distribution company (see Net Metering below). Governments should facilitate DG power
generation by industrial users, particularly the use of combined heat and power, and where possible
the sale of excess power back to the grid during peak periods. DG growth in remote areas, through
the establishment of micro-grids and home systems, also has tremendous potential. Gradually, as
developing country electricity markets become more competitive and sustainable, DG can be
allowed to compete with electric utilities in wholesale and perhaps eventually in retail markets.
With greater market access, however, also comes increased structural, operational and price
complexities that will have to be managed by independent regulators.164
Net Metering
One policy mechanism for promoting small distributed generation is the use of net metering,
sometimes called net billing. Originally developed for a vertically integrated utility, net metering
allows customers to sell electricity from small distributed generation to the local distribution
company at (or close to) the retail price.165 New, more sophisticated metering technologies are
capable of tracking usage and sales by time of day. A total of 30 states in the U.S. have adopted
net metering for electric utilities in various forms. Net metering prices can vary by customer class
(commercial, residential, etc.), size (systems up to 10 or 100 kW), system or fuel type (renewables,
cogeneration, including fuel cells) and be limited by a maximum size allowed, or number of
customers per geographic area.166 For example, net metering is sometimes limited to only the
electricity sold back to the distribution system that exceeds the amount of electricity consumed by
the customer in a given billing period (often called net excess generation). The sale of electricity
back to the grid is often at retail prices.
But net metering has its limitations. In India, state electricity boards that are required to buy back
electricity from biomass and wind power projects at a fixed rate complain that prices they are
required to pay are eroding their profitability.167 The IEA has concluded that it is not economically
efficient and has the potential to distort markets.168 Texas, which allows excess power from
distributed generation to be sold into competitive markets, determined that net metering was not
compatible with open retail competition.169 A report prepared by the Embedded Generation
Working Group in the UK, found that a detailed cost-benefit analysis was needed before setting net
metering tariffs.170

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Electricity Pricing
Another barrier to distributed generation is the utility tariff rate.171 With interconnection standards
and expedited interconnect procedures for DG in place, developing country governments will need
to adopt appropriate market signals to take into account the complete range of benefits provided by
distributed generation. While DG should be allowed to fairly compete with central power, it must
also bear its fair share of the costs imposed on the transmission and distribution system.172 A
number of different factors need to be taken into account when developing an appropriate tariff and
fees system for distributed generation.
In many instances DG can bring down the cost of electricity when one takes into account true
delivery costs and line losses. The World Alliance for Decentralized Energy (WADE) argues that
the standard metrics used to determine the cost of electricity  capital per kW of new electricity
generation and cost per kWh to generate electricity  do not capture all the costs, especially the
transmission and distribution costs, of delivering a kWh of electricity. 173 A study commissioned
by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in the U.S. found that most
utilities agreed that the expanded use of DG can help reduce energy costs.174 The potential for
similar cost savings exist in developing countries as well.
According to WADE, the following pricing principles should be followed:
1. Electricity system pricing should be fully cost-reflective, with no cross
subsidies from one part of the system to another.
2. Use of transmission and distribution networks should be priced according to
the services they provide.
3. Any benefits that generators (including decentralized energy) provide to the
system (for example, voltage support, grid stability, and reduction in
transmission and distribution losses), should be fairly reflected in system
pricing.
4. Generators should be charged fees in a fair and transparent way for their
system impacts and no more.175
The low electricity tariffs and price subsidies in developing countries are among the biggest
hurdles that DG will have to face. Presently, privatization in many developing countries has been
put on hold and government owned electric utilities remain in dire financial difficulty, while those
that have been privatized struggle to survive. A book recently published by the Inter-American
Development Bank on power sector reform in Latin America found that while some improvements
have resulted from market reforms, the electricity sector is still plagued by low efficiency, cross
subsidies, insufficient tariffs to cover costs, and poor prospects for new investment.176 Until such
time as regulators are capable of imposing and collecting tariffs to cover the costs of the electric
utility system, the sale of DG through the electricity grid will likely be minimal.

Business Council for Sustainable Energy
Box 4. Latin America Power Sector Reform: Lessons Learned177
Introducing more realistic price signals is a difficult but key challenge for the power sectors of Colombia,
Guatemala and Honduras. Without such signals, new investment cannot be financed, supply capacity will
be exhausted, and the power sector will continue to drain government finances. Political support must be
mustered to allow for price adjustments. A starting point might be to eliminate certain cross subsidies,
especially those that reach middle- or higher-income groups. Measures to increase price flexibility should
be targeted primarily at larger customers that will probably be willing and able to negotiate prices on
reasonable terms. Eventually, greater use of the pricing instrument should be allowed across all market
segments.
Location Based Pricing
Rate structures do not normally take into account the varying costs of providing distribution
services.178 The IEA recommends that location-based pricing mechanisms be adopted to provide
incentives to establish DG units along the distribution system where they can reduce overall costs
and line losses and relieve congestion.179 The less electricity delivered the fewer earnings for
distributors.180 The key is ensuring that there is also an incentive for distributors.
Allocating the economic benefits and costs of DG requires reliable data on the generation,
transmission and distribution systems.181 One place to start is by requiring utilities to undertake a
cost-benefit analysis of their distribution facilities to assess areas where the local benefits of DG
might exceed the costs of upgrading or constructing new distribution lines.182 In New South Wales,
Australia, for example, regulators require the distribution utility to maintain a list of all major
distribution upgrades, areas with the worst reliability records and the load reductions needed to
avoid upgrades. If poor performing areas are not due to be upgraded, they are candidates for
distributed generation. Another location-based pricing mechanism is the use of financial credits for
DG installed in a designated area of the distribution grid where upgrades are needed.183 The credit
is a function of the cost savings and is limited in duration and amount. A three-step pilot program
for implementing distribution credits has been prepared by NREL.184 Distribution companies could
also be allowed to solicit bids for DG services within the system and award a capacity contract to
the bid that proves to be more economical than line required upgrades.185
Peak Pricing
Exposing customers to higher costs during peak periods is another means of encouraging the
development of DG or reducing demand when the network is most overloaded. This, coupled with
special peak tariffs to promote the sale of DG power back into the grid, can also relieve

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
congestion.186 Similarly, congestion pricing where load customers pay a tariff for distribution
services, can also be used, although it is more difficult to implement.187
Connection and Standby Charges
An important question facing DG is how to fairly charge for the use of the distribution system.
Connection charges often serve as a barrier to distributed generation. In the UK, DG generators
pay an up-front fee for the cost of connecting to the grid  often called a deep connection charge.
The fee takes into consideration location-based pricing and obviates the need for any additional
distribution fees. The Netherlands, on the other hand, charges DG only for the direct costs of
connecting to the grid. Larger distributed generation is also assessed an additional systems fee.
The IEA recommends the use of a direct connection charge for new distributed generation
connected to the grid and allowing distribution companies to issue fees to recover any grid
reinforcement costs that result from DG providers.188
In the U.S., many utilities apply what are known as standby charges to DG facilities. These are
usually a monthly demand charge ($/kW) that is associated with the fixed cost of the transmission
and distribution system.189 Standby charges also serve to compensate the utility for the supply of
electricity to replace or supplement a customers usual source of DG power or to provide backup
during unscheduled outages. Many utilities complain that the standby charges are too low. Critics
counter, however, that the fees imposed by utilities are excessive and based on worst-case
scenarios. The true cost of providing standby power is difficult to assess on a customer-bycustomer basis.190 Nevertheless, it is a matter that must be addressed in a balanced and equitable
manner.
Another issue is whether utilities should be compensated for stranded costs  costs for previous
generation, transmission and distribution investments that are not needed because customers are
self-generating with DG. Utilities seek to recoup these costs by imposing competitive transition
charges (CTC). When customers leave the grid or reduce their loads through the use of distributed
generation, utilities will often charge an exit fees to make up for the lost sales.191 Normally state
restructuring laws or the state public utility commission set the CTC or exit fee. Such fees are
often based on a customers historical load usage. They can either be issued in a one-time lump
sum payment or paid over time.192 Utilities contend that customers who install DG unfairly shift
the burden of paying for stranded costs on other utility customers, who must make up the loss by
paying higher fees.
IEA, DG IN LIBERALIZED MARKETS at 86.
Another advanced tool is demand response, that is, active load management by customers to enhance
market efficiency and system reliability coupled with energy efficiency investments to lower market
clearing prices, improve reliability and lower overall costs. Like congestion pricing, however, demand
response requires real-time market information, something developing countries almost never have. See,
New England Demand Response Initiative, Dimensions of Demand Response at 2. For a discussion of
technical factors influencing demand side management service pricing strategies, see California Energy
Comm., Distributed Generation Case Studies at 177.

Business Council for Sustainable Energy
These fees, however, can have a significant effect on the economic viability of a DG project.
Critics argue that such fees act to limit market competition from more efficient and cost-effective
DG sources. Opponents also add that the amount of DG installed will not outpace demand
growth.193 A number of states in the U.S. have exempted distributed generation from paying for
stranded costs. New Jersey and Massachusetts, for example, impose a fee to recoup stranded costs
from DG only after it reaches a certain level of market penetration.194 The market penetration level
for New Jersey is 7.5 percent and 10 percent for Massachusetts.195
Codes, Permits & Environmental Standards
Another potential obstacle to DG is navigating the bureaucracies of city and local agencies
associated with zoning, siting and environmental impact matters. The adoption of DG technologies
often will require complying with a plethora of local building, fire, health and safety requirements,
waste management and storm water discharge standards.196 The time and cost associated with
obtaining such permits can be daunting. To the extent such permitting requirements exist, local
agencies should develop handbooks for preparing the required paper.197 Energy regulators can also
assist distribution companies by providing them with guidance on the level of review expected for
different technologies; lists of the local agencies responsible for approving DG projects; and
samples of DG projects that have previously received agency approval. Checklists with the
possible environmental impacts from DG projects, and summaries of the compatibility of such
projects with local land use plans and ordinances, should also be explored. In each instance,
application review and approval processes should be expedited.
Streamlining may be required with air permits, which in the US have been cited as one of the
obstacles to distributed generation.198 Many developing countries, however, may not even have
such regulations in place. Most air emissions standards are designed with large central power
stations in mind and based on emission per unit of fuel consumed and not emissions per unit of
power produced, or in the case of combined heat and power, kilowatt-hours and equivalent
energy produced. 199 Setting emissions standards on unit of fuel consumed discourages energy
efficiency and pollution prevention. Recommendations for improving environmental requirements
for distributed generation include:
Creating a streamlined and uniform standards approach to distributed generation projects,
with pre-certification and minimum requirements that balance economic considerations
with public policy objectives;
Allowing the replacement of older technologies with new DG technologies;
Issuing credits for cogeneration operations; and
Providing emissions allowances for renewables or other environmentally beneficial DG
technologies.200

The development of new environmental permitting requirements should still allow localities to
maintain permit jurisdiction to insure that all high-priority public policy interests are protected, if
not advanced.201
Economic and Financial Incentives
While establishing a favorable regulatory environment is important, additional financial incentives
are also required to address DGs high up-front costs. A number of financing mechanisms can be
considered for DG, including tax incentives, buy-down programs, special tariffs, low interest loans
and guarantees and development funds. Box 5 outlines the critical elements needed in developing
a successful financial incentive program. The appropriate mix of financing options will depend
largely on whether the market is at an advanced, emerging or initial pioneer state, the strength of
the countrys finance sector and the anticipated demand for the technology.202 In devising an
incentive scheme, governments need to evaluate and assess the actual status, benefits and
limitations of current and future DG technologies.203 Studies have shown that multiple financial
incentives are necessary to advance distributed generation markets, particularly for renewable
technologies. Ultimately, financial incentives should form part of a larger infrastructure and
energy development strategy that is market driven.
Tax Incentives and Credits
Tax incentives are an important tool in promoting DG. These include income tax, investment tax
and production-tax credits, tax loss carry-forwards, capital depreciation, duty exemption on
imported capital equipment and tax credits on domestic equipment.204 If successful in expanding
markets, tax credits can end up providing a net gain in revenues to the taxing entity.205 Most
modern DG technologies in developing countries will have to be imported at first. Some larger
countries, such as Brazil, India or Mexico, manufacture their own DG technologies. In India, the
use of investment tax credits and the relaxation of import tariffs were vital in helping to stimulate
the countrys wind and solar PV market.206
Exemptions for sales and property taxes and the reduction or elimination of customs duties on
imported equipment offer important investment incentives. Income tax credits that reduce an
individuals or business federal or state income tax, normally for 10 to 35 percent of the
investment, may also be used to allow either accelerated principal and interest payments or a higher
rate of return.207 A recent report for NREL on the effectiveness of state incentives in the U.S. for
renewable energy found that investment tax credits are simpler to administer and enforce compared
with other incentives.208 They may also be more politically palatable than cash payments because

Box 5. Critical Elements for a Successful Financial Incentive Program209
Funding Stability and Duration. Incentives should be available over multiyear terms and have
stable funding.
Incentive Amount. First, the incentive level must be high enough  particularly in the first years of
the program  but not so high that it distorts the market sector it is intended to help. Second, the
incentive amount should decline over time as the market develops. This acts to motivate potential
customers to buy sooner when the incentive is higher and to help wean the industry and the
marketplace off the incentive, easing the transition to a subsidy-free sustainable market. Finally,
incentives should be limited to a certain level-per-watt capacity to prevent manufacturers and dealers
from inflating prices.
Quality Assurance. Incentive programs must include provisions to ensure adequate system
performance through minimum equipment standards, installer certification, and production-based
incentives.
Application Process. Incentives should be easy to apply for and include appropriate assistance from
program administrators. Early adopters who experience a cumbersome application process
accompanied by a long wait to receive an incentive payment (a buy-down) or approval for loan, are
likely to spread the word to others, deterring potential customers from using the program.
Consumer Education and Awareness. A sustained marketing campaign to educate the public
about DG technologies in general, and about the availability of incentives in particular, is critical to
program success.
6. Institutional Barriers. Program success will be limited if institutional and structural issues are not
addressed.
These include working with utilities to develop a smooth and standardized
interconnection process, and educating the inspectors, realtors, insurers, bankers, utilities, and other
stakeholders who may participate in or have authority over deploying the technologies.
7. Complementary Financial Incentives. Any given incentive should be considered as part of a
package of policies designed to stimulate market development. Financial incentives that can
complement or enhance tax credits and buy-downs include low-interest loans, net metering, property
tax exemptions, and sales-tax exemptions.
they do not require governments to appropriate funds. Maximum limits range from $1,000 to
$10,500 for residential and up $50,000 or more for commercial systems. According to NREL,
carrying-over tax credits should be limited to avoid reducing the taxs overall benefit.210
Governments may also want to consider including performance requirements as part of a tax credit
plan to ensure that DG systems are not only built but actually produce power.
Another tool is the production tax credit where credit is issued based on total kilowatt-hours of
electricity produced. Credits may be applied to the purchaser or distributor of electricity from a
DG facility. Production tax credits are more difficult to apply for smaller scale systems, especially
those located off-grid. Nevertheless, according to the review by the World Bank of Global
Environment Facility projects designed to remove barriers to renewable energy in developing
countries, [p]olicies that promote production-based incentives rather than investment-based
incentives are more likely to spur the best industry performance and sustainability.211

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
One potential drawback to tax credits or exemptions is that they normally only apply to entities that
pay taxes. The impact can also be muted if collection rates are low due to tax evasion, which is a
serious problem in many developing countries. Tax credits also leave out important market
players, such as charities, NGOs and government entities. To address this issue the state of Oregon
established a pass-through option where a tax-exempt entity is allowed to transfer the tax credit
to a third party in exchange for the net value of the credit.212 Another important element to
consider when adopting tax incentives is which agency will be responsible for its implementation.
Will it be the revenue department or the energy ministry? The latter will allow for better control of
program details, such as the number of participants and types of technologies installed.
Buy-Down Programs
Another tool available to governments is the use of buy-down programs that offer rebates or cash
incentives to encourage the installation of DG technologies. The theory behind buy-down
programs is that they stimulate early technology deployment and encourage manufacturers and
distributors to increase their investment.213 Incentives often range from $3/W to $6/W (20 to 60
percent of the system cost) and include a performance standard to ensure that the operation is
completed.214 Studies suggest that high and sustainable incentive levels are required in the early
stages of a program until barriers are eliminated and the market matures.215
While consumers generally prefer cash incentives to tax credits, they require explicit funding and
can cause problems if the industry grows too rapidly. Care must be taken to ensure that demand
does not exceed the capacity of equipment suppliers and qualified installers. The discontinuation
of programs can also have a sudden adverse impact on the industry. Governments may also need
to help ensure that infrastructure needs are met. In some instances, utilities may be provided grants
to assist in developing distributed generation technologies in their service areas.
Low Interest Loans, Credit and Guarantees
Another barrier to DG technologies, particularly renewables, is attracting access to long-term credit
on reasonable terms. Rural customers and clean energy entrepreneurs that service them find
obtaining credit particular difficult.216 Long-term loans at low interest rates are an important
vehicle for addressing the high up-front capital costs of DG technologies. Financing can either be
provided to the consumer through end-user credit mechanisms, to the utility, to the DG company or
energy service provider, or to other financiers, including micro-credit institutions and NGOs.
Banks in Indonesia provide low-interest loans to consumers to purchase home PV systems, and
NGOs in Peru and Nepal are making credit available to local communities to install micro-grid
systems that use small hydroelectric systems.217 Energy service companies provide end users credit
through fee-for-service PV or wind electrification, where the customer pays a monthly or quarterly
number of the turbines built are now inoperative. Id. See also, Govt. of India, Report of the Committee on

fee for the electricity produced.218
If implemented properly, loan programs can be self-sustaining through a revolving fund and be
tailored to achieve different goals. By themselves, however, low interest loans often do not
provide enough cost savings to spur significant market development. Issuing below market rates
and keeping fees to a minimum will help ensure greater program success.219 Like buy-down
programs, funding could be derived from a specific source, either through a system-benefit charge,
special taxes (such as on petroleum), the sale of bonds, or annual appropriations from government
revenues. Another important vehicle when selling power to a government controlled entity is the
receipt of a performance undertaking, or guarantee by the government, that ensures the entity
will discharge its obligations.220 Such a guarantee is often required by international or multilateral
finance agencies, particularly for larger projects. Counter guarantees may also be required to back
up local government guarantees on debt that is locally raised.221
Public Benefit Funds for Rural Electrification
A major benefit of distributed generation is its ability to be located in remote areas where grid
extension is not economically or physically viable. There are three types of rural populations that
are traditionally served by distributed generation: dispersed families (people that are located too
far from other population centers to be served by the grid); population centers (people living close
enough to share energy resources, usually ten to 500 households living in villages); and isolated
production centers (commercial facilities that usually have their own generation facility).222
Traditionally, state-owned utilities were encouraged to expand their grids to rural areas regardless
of cost. Such projects were often overbuilt and exceeded customer demand. Because transmission
and distribution costs are often high for remote areas, developing country electricity rates in rural
areas are frequently subsidized. With the unbundling and privatization of electric utilities,
distribution companies are more focused on raising revenue to cover costs and have little appetite
for extending grid services unless forced to do so or sufficient incentives are provided. A report by
the Special Committee on Distributive Generation in India found that State Governments have
been reluctant to avail themselves even of the assistance of the 100% grant under the Kutir Jyoti
programs on account of apprehension due to recurring revenue loss through such concessions.223
In most instances government subsidies are required to accelerate rural electrification. Appendix 1
outlines the World Banks views on good and bad subsidies. The first rule of thumb is that
subsidies should always fall within the governments own financial and human resource constraints.
Second, subsidies should only be directed at lowering the cost of capital and reducing the cost of
energy, and not be used to cover operating expenses.224 Subsidies and grants may also be needed
for market-conditioning activities such as preparing resource and feasibility studies, project
design, promotion and training, and setting and enforcing standards.225 There are a number of
different models for providing government subsidies for rural electrification. Argentina has adopted
a top-down approach, giving a monopoly to the company that offers the greatest amount of service

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Box 6. Case Study: Chiles Rural Electrification Program226
Although Chile liberalized its electricity sector in the 1980s with considerable success, market reforms failed to
meet rural demand. By the early 1990s, half of the countrys rural population  a million people  still lacked
electricity. In 1994, Chile launched an ambitious rural electrification program that used a competitive, least-cost
bottom-up approach that included state subsidies, regional and project competition for funds, private sector
energy services, social and economic indicators and a decentralized and fully transparent decision making
process.
At the state level, the National Energy Commission (CNE) manages the program and provides a one-time direct
subsidy to private distribution or energy service companies to cover their investment costs. CNE allocates the
subsidy funds to regional governments based on the amount of progress made in the previous year and the
number of remaining households without electrification. The CNE also provides regional governments with
planning and management models, methodologies for ensuring efficient allocation of state subsidies and preinvestment studies to establish sound project portfolios.
Normally, communities seeking rural electrification projects do so with the support of local distribution or energy
service companies. Most projects involve line extensions but also include renewable and hybrid off-grid
applications. Proposals are presented to the municipal government that in turn asks the private company to
prepare a technical project. Once complete, all technical proposals are listed in a public registry. Users must
cover the costs of wiring and the metering and coupling to the grid, which usually amount to 10 percent of the
projects costs. These costs are advanced by the distribution company and paid by the users over time, on top of
the regulated tariffs. Private companies invest their own resources, own and manage the installations and assume
the commercial risk.
Projects are evaluated by the regional planning agency and include their social impact, cost-benefit ratio and the
amount of private investment being offered providing for the highest impact per unit of investment. In order to
receive a subsidy, a project must have a positive social but negative private rate of return. The program allows
companies to obtain a 10 percent return on investment over a 30 year period. Those that meet the minimum
requirements are then reviewed by the regional council that manages the subsidy and approves the final projects.
Off-grid projects normally involve one-house photovoltaic systems, of which 1,000 have thus far been installed.
Occasionally, grants are also dispersed for off-grid projects.
In seven years, the program increased Chiles electrification rate 53 percent in 1995 to 75 percent in 1999. The
average state subsidy increased by $430 from $1,080 in 1995 to $1,510 in 1999 per household. Responding to a
request from the government of Chile, the Inter-American Development Bank in September, 2003, approved a
US$40 million loan to reach 90 percent in every Chilean region by 2006. This new phase of the Chilean Rural
Electrification Program will provide grid access to 28,000 new families, as well as sustainable off-grid solutions
to 8,000 families, based on single home solar photovoltaic systems and isolated mini grids supplied by winddiesel hybrid or small hydropower generation systems.
at the lowest price.227 Giving exclusive access to one provider or distribution company has a
number of benefits. As Keith Kozloff, formerly with PA Consulting, notes, a distribution company
with exclusive access to an off-grid area can balance returns of grid-connected and off-grid
customers, . . . absorb market entry costs, achieve economy of scale in equipment and operations
and maintenance costs, exploit its existing network of local agents, and use its large cash flow to
finance systems and absorb seasonal variations in customers ability to pay.228
In Chile, the government adopted a slightly different approach than Argentina. (See Box 6 above).
Chiles rural electrification program is a more bottom-up approach that requires private developers
and regional governments to compete for federal funds and provides a market incentive that
encourages the adoption of least-cost options that also provide the greatest benefit to the public.

Appendix 1 outlines some of the lessons learned by the World Bank in undertaking rural
electrification.
While most rural electrification projects involve grid extensions, the more remote projects are
increasingly turning to renewable DG sources. According to Anil Cabraal with the World Bank
Energy and Water Department, countries are beginning to recognize off-grid options as a
legitimate electrification method.229 Understanding local needs is vital for the successful
application of DG technologies in remote areas. Local community organizations, rural
cooperatives and NGOs can assist with needs assessment and project implementation. Combining
decentralized energy projects with other infrastructure projects, such as those extending water,
health, educational, and telecommunications services, can also engender community support and
help leverage funds from different sources.230 Still, even with subsidies, credit and other finance
assistance, more is often needed to deepen market penetration.
Investing in Human Capital, Education and Outreach
For distributed generation to gain market entry in developing country electricity markets,
government commitment will be needed on many fronts. Particularly important is the need for
adequate delivery mechanisms. Over the past ten years, a large number of DG pilot projects in
developing countries have failed, largely due to lack of maintenance and incorrect use.231 In
Senegal, nearly 90 percent of the countrys wind-powered water pumps are inoperative due to
lapses in maintenance.232
For DG technologies to succeed requires sufficient human capital to install and repair them.
Developing countries have a large labor supply that can easily be trained to assemble, deploy and
service small DG energy systems. Government can help by providing training for contractors and
institutional support and technical assistance to businesses and small entrepreneurs working in DG
services. Development funds can also be used to provide small grants and seed capital for start-up
companies that provide DG services, particularly those working in rural areas.233 In addition,
greater understanding of DG technologies by end users is vital. As R.K. Pachauri, former President
of the Tata Energy and Resources Institute-North America, notes, capacity must be built within
the user base to perpetuate usage.234
Greater understanding of DG technologies is also very important. As part of their overall
development strategy, governments will need to engage and educate a variety of players about
different DG technologies, their benefits and the availability of financial incentives and other
sources of support. Government outreach should also include the general public, industry,
regulators, inspectors, realtors, insurers, bankers, utilities, distribution companies and other

stakeholders.235
Conclusion
Although distributed generation is not a panacea for solving developing country energy problems,
when combined with energy efficiency measures it has considerable potential to help meet
increased electricity needs. Distributed generation can lesson demand and reduce peak loads,
postpone the need for expensive line upgrades, add much needed power to the grid through greater
use of combined heat and power and other DG technologies, extend power to remote areas and
create income through the sale of excess power back to the grid. It also offers important
environmental benefits. DG technologies have the potential to reduce air emissions and improve
public health. They also emit less greenhouse gasses than the traditional energy mix.
Still, challenges to DG technologies abound. Most developing country electricity markets suffer
from a lack of competition and weak regulatory bodies. Continued use of subsidies undermines the
financial stability of many utilities and discourages the use of distributed generation by hiding the
true cost of providing electric power to the consumer. Promoting DG technologies requires new
investment, sufficient equipment and skilled technicians. It also involves a high degree of
regulatory complexity and government involvement, which seems difficult at a time when several
studies point to the need for developing countries to simplify their energy regulations to better
reflect local market conditions.236
With most power sector reforms in developing countries still a work-in-progress, governments
have an opportunity to modify the traditional central power station model and adopt a more flexible
regulatory framework that levels the playing field for DG technologies. Recognizing that there are
both benefits and costs associated with DG, the first step for governments is to carefully examine
the impact and viability of DG under local market conditions and the potential contribution that DG
can make to a countrys energy mix. Working in close consultation with utilities, transmission
companies, energy service companies, regulators, trade associations and NGOs, governments will
need to assess:
existing distributed generation power sources from local industry;
the potential for greater use of combined heat and power applications;
the availability of manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of DG technologies;
the true costs and infrastructure needs of transmission and distribution networks;
options for DG technologies to meet rural and urban electrification needs without
compromising system integrity, reliability or safety;
the impact of DG on the financial viability of the central electric utility system; and
specific technical, regulatory, administrative and financial barriers to distributed
generation.
From this process should emerge a development plan that clearly identifies ways to accelerate the
use of DG technologies in targeted areas to help meet power sector objectives. Key elements of
such a plan should include or address the following issues:

Business Council for Sustainable Energy
Essential Market Reforms and Conditions. Even if a vertically integrated electric utility
remains intact, private entities should be allowed to generate power, interconnect with the grid
and compete in wholesale markets on non-discriminatory terms. Transmission and distribution
costs need to be evaluated to help determine the benefits and impacts of DG to the grid and
promote least-cost system upgrades and expansion. An independent regulator should be
established with the authority and resources necessary to police the market.
Uniform Standards & Procedures. Uniform technical standards for grid interconnection and
testing and certification procedures for DG equipment should be made easily accessible.
Similarly, grid interconnection and parallel operation applications and power purchase
agreements should be streamlined and standardized to lower transaction costs. Dispute
resolution procedures should be adopted to ensure fair and speedy resolution by a qualified
entity or government body. Equipment installers should be certified to ensure quality system
performance and adequate maintenance. Local authorities should be directed to simplify
application procedures to comply with fire, health and safety, zoning, environmental impact,
water discharge and waste management requirements.
Elimination of Cross-Subsidies. Cross subsidies should be gradually discontinued.
Pricing. The ancillary and environmental benefits of distributed generation should be
recognized in any pricing system. Long-term and stable tariffs and power purchase contracts
should be provided for DG power producers connected to the grid.
Transmission Charges & Fees. Connection and back-up charges should be limited to a
generators impacts and benefits to the distribution system. Transmission rate structures
should not be biased against low-capacity renewable DG technologies.
Natural Gas Infrastructure. Natural gas distribution networks should be strengthened and
expanded in industrial and commercial areas that can most benefit from distributed generation.
Market-Based Mechanisms. There should be a thorough exploration of market-based
mechanisms, such as emissions or renewable energy credits, and taxes that incorporate
environmental costs and more adequately represent energy conversion efficiencies.
Economic Incentives. An economic incentive package to stimulate DG market development
should ensure that production actually occurs and incentives do not distort the market. An
aggressive marketing and out-reach campaign should be undertaken simultaneously in
collaboration with utilities, trade associations, NGOs and local government entities.
Rural Electrification. DG technologies should be allowed to fairly compete with grid
extension based on a least cost analysis and an assessment of local electricity needs. Whenever
possible, rural electrification should be integrated with other infrastructure development
projects.
Technical and Institutional Support. Governments will need to provide a wide range of
technical and institutional support to industry and business, utilities, local entrepreneurs and
government agencies to facilitate the deployment of DG technologies and services. Wider
awareness of both the pros and cons of distributed generation will be needed. Government
leadership and commitment is essential.
In the long run, power sector reforms in developing countries that continue to unduly favor
conventional centralized power generation technologies will have an increasingly detrimental
environmental impact and are likely to fail in meeting the performance, quality and power needs of
end users, especially those located outside large cities. With the proper regulatory structures and
incentives, DG can complement central power while increasing access to energy in an incremental,
clean and reliable manner.

Increasing Energy Access in Developing Countries: The Role of Distributed Generation
Appendix 1
World Bank Rural Electrification: Lessons Learned
Project Criteria. Criteria for selection and priority-setting for rural electrification should be open and objective.
Political interference in the implementation of rural electrification programs can add considerably to the costs of
system expansion.
Local Involvement Key. Rural electrification programs can benefit greatly from the involvement of local
communities - or suffer because of its absence. Projects are more likely to be viable and sustainable if local
stakeholders are involved in their design and implementation. One way to approach this is to set up a Rural
Electrification Committee to help assess level of demand, educate consumers, and promote the wider use of
electricity. The concept of Area Coverage Rural Electrification  a distribution system based on member-owned
rural electric cooperatives - has been successfully used (e.g. in Bangladesh).
Grid Extension. Grid extension is sometimes not the most cost-effective solution; decentralized delivery options
and alternative energy sources--such as solar PV, mini-hydro and other renewable energy sources--should be
considered, following the principle of least-cost development.
Private Sector Participation. The private sector can be attracted to participate in rural electrification schemes, even
in a poor country, if an appropriate legal framework and risk management options are in place, including the
assurance of a level playing field in terms of competition and the ability to charge full cost-recovery tariffs.
Financial viability/cost recovery. Identify economic limits to extensions to the grid and the economic potential of
lower-cost options and alternative energy sources. A rational system of cost recovery should take into account
capital investment costs, level of local contribution, number and density of consumers, likely demand for electricity;
also, the willingness to pay and payment capability of the population.
Tariff Regime. The tariff regime should ensure that rural electrification programs are financially sustainable and
will not drain operational resources. Tariffs should cover the full cost of medium-voltage generation/transmission,
plus low-voltage operations/maintenance costs, and should provide for eventual capital replacement costs.
Connection Charges. Initial connection charges are a greater barrier to rural families than the monthly electricity
bill. Consider the provision of financing to spread the costs of connection fees over an extended period, or lower
connection rates for the poor, so that the benefits of electrification may reach larger numbers of people; consider also
arranging financial assistance for the credit/hire purchase of electrical appliances.
Good Subsidies. The tariff structure needs to ensure that any subsidies are fair, equitable, and sustainable. A
good subsidy scheme enhances access for the poor (improving the quality of life/reducing energy expense);
encourage the rural electrification business; sustains incentives for efficient delivery/consumption; and must be
practicable within the financial/human resource constraints of government/power utility. A portion of the capital
may be subsidized, obtained at concessionary rates, or as a government/donor grant. A low lifeline tariff is
acceptable on income redistribution grounds.
Subsidy No-Nos. Subsidization of operating costs has widely proved to be counter-productive and to undermine the
utilities' financial position, their ability to extend service, and ultimately the rural electrification programs
themselves.
Implementation agency. Implementing agencies must have a high degree of operating autonomy and be held
accountable; dynamic leadership and employees with job security and career prospects are a key to success. Clear
contractual arrangements between the government and implementing agencies are important.
Minimize construction and operating costs. Assess technology and available standards during the planning stage;
deploy low-cost equipment; use innovative technologies, approaches, and local suppliers; standardize materials.
Consider the use of "ready-boards" to reduce connection costs. Design the system for expected loads (much lower in
rural than urban areas) to reduce construction costs; provide for future upgrades.

California Energy Commission - Key Policy and Regulatory
Questions for Distributed Generation
Interconnect Issues
 Can interconnection rules be standardized?
 Can interconnection be made more user-friendly to the end consumer?
 Can a substantial amount of DG be interconnected in both radial and networked distribution systems?
 Are there safe, reliable and cost-effective interconnection solutions for radial and networked distribution
systems?
 Can interconnection solutions be applied in a timely manner?
 Can Engineering studies for interconnection be eliminated, standardized or streamlined?
 Is a single DG unit compatible with end-use equipment or other DG equipment?
 Can qualified interconnection systems be certified so that they may be installed with minimal field-testing?
 Have potential DG installations been postponed or abandoned due to existing interconnection rules or costs?
Grid Effects
 What are the beneficial and detrimental impacts of high DG penetration on the transmission and distribution
system, and how may they be quantified and assessed?
 What are the limits to the level of DG that the grid can absorb without adverse consequences?
 What are the limitations on bi-directional power?
 Should the design of new distribution feeders consider DG?
 Are the use of micro-grids practical?
Market Integration and Regulatory Issues
 It is in the States interest to promote DG?
 How should the rules be modified to allow DG to better participate in current markets?
 Can transaction costs associated with obtaining permits for DG be reduced?
 How can tariffs and rates be designated to provide better price transparency to DG?
 Are there too many public subsidies being provided for DG?
 Should incentives for DG be further enhanced?
 Should regulatory rules be changed to support the development of micro-grids?
 How does the suspension of direct effect impact the marketability of DG?
 Are there ways to balance the imposition of exit fees with the marketability of DG?
 Should utilities be offered incentives in return for eliminating exit fees when DG is installed on their
systems?
 Should standards for system control and communication devices be developed to better enable DG to
participate in markets?
 Should utilities be provided incentives to facilitate DG?
 Should utilities be allowed to install and use DG, and participate with other DG developers, and if so, how
should this proceed?
Environmental Issues
 What is the environmental impact of DG technologies, and how can their impact be minimized?
 What is the environmental life-cycle impact of DG compared to central station power plants?
 What technologies and emission controls are needed to make air emissions from DG as clean as those from
central station power plants?
 What would be the best way to promote waste-to-energy DG projects that help improve air and water
quality and reduce greenhouse gases?

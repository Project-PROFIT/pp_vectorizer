      1.  Summary and Conclusions
There is no agreed definition of energy subsidies between EU member
states or reporting organisations. The term may include direct, indirect
or implicit mechanisms, as well as the failure to correct market
imperfections, such as not allocating external cost or recognising energy
security costs. This results in a wide range of economic estimates and
confused policy argument. Similarly, beyond the annual report of direct
state aid for the coal industry, there is no harmonised reporting
mechanism.  Several attempts have been made over recent years to provide
a full audit of EU energy support by the European Parliament (Oosterhuis
2001) and the European Commission (2003a). Both are snapshots based upon
best available data, rather than structured ongoing reviews and have not
been updated since.
This paper has synthesized data from across a range of sources to
estimate the size of support to energy sources. Total direct and indirect
subsidies are estimated in the order of Euro 25 billion per year. Despite
the significant air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions emanating from
the burning of fossil fuels, the amount of fossil fuel subsidies remains
high, particularly in the area of coal[1]. Support for renewables, which
is generally considered environmentally beneficial, is increasing
steadily through the introduction of regulatory support mechanisms. On a
per unit basis renewables attract higher support than other fuel types.
There is an emerging debate over whether this level of funding can be
justified.
To reach more definite conclusions over the appropriateness of the
amounts of subsidies on the different fuels requires developing a clear
picture on the scale and scope of support for different fuel types across
the EU. The lack of consistent subsidy data and assumptions is an
obstacle to this. A harmonised reporting framework on the basis of an
agreed definition of what constitute an energy subsidy is needed for
Europe.
Making a direct comparison between current support for renewable
technologies and that for more established industries is however
misleading.  Renewable energy is a much less mature industry, requiring
significant technological and market support.  It should be expected that
subsidy requirements for the industry will fall as costs decline and the
technologies mature.  In historical terms, renewable energy subsidies in
the EU are relatively low in comparison to other forms of energy during
periods of fuel transition and technology development.  In addition, the
fossil fuel and nuclear industries continue to benefit from the
technological and industrial infrastructure built up during previous
decades, and enjoy a high level of state ownership across the member
states.
Renewable energy support must also be understood in the current market
context. Energy market liberalisation and privatisation have led to lower
energy prices, greater energy price volatility and increased commercial
risk for new capacity investment. This has created concerns about energy
security in the event of limited private investment in new capacity.
The projected retirement of a substantial number of fossil fuel plants in
the EU will create great opportunities for replacement by cleaner
technologies. Unlike government the private sector carries little or no
obligation to address long-term energy security or environmental issues.
It is the responsibility of government to ensure that the market responds
to these.
With current levels of support the EU renewable energy indicative targets
by 2010 will not be met.
Renewable technologies offer the benefits of both increased energy
security and reduced environmental impacts.  The policy rationale for
their economic support will be strengthened as their contribution to
reducing price volatility and lowering overall emissions is better
understood and quantified.  In the light of this, governments are prudent
to value these benefits and to set long-term price signals for industry
development.
      2.  Introduction
This paper has been prepared by AEA Technology for the European
Environment Agency on the occasion of the International Renewables
Conference (June 2004).
It sets out a brief overview of energy subsidy rationale, definition and
reporting, before providing an overview of subsidy activity per energy
fuel in the European Union. It goes on to call for a more integrated
approach to recognising the economics of environmental and security
benefits presented by the increased role of renewables in national energy
portfolios. The paper does not examine energy conservation subsidies and
includes only EU-15 estimates of energy fuel subsidies due to lack of
data.
Economic and policy context
Energy subsidy reform and the environment. The 6th Environmental Action
Programme of the European Union encourages reforms of subsidies with
considerable negative effects on the environment and that are
incompatible with sustainable development and stresses the need to
undertake as soon as possible an inventory and review of subsidies that
counteract an efficient and sustainable use of energy with a view to
gradually phasing them out (European Parliament and Council 2002).
In general, subsidies supporting fossil fuels  particularly coal and
oil  represent greater threats to the environment than those that aid
renewable energy sources. Those that support nuclear power contribute to
unique environmental and safety issues, related mostly to the risk of
high-level environmental damage, rather than ongoing degradation.
Subsidies to renewable energy are generally considered, on balance,
environmentally beneficial, although the full range of environmental
effects of renewable energy (including those beyond the energy sector)
also needs to be taken into account. (OECD 2004).
Renewable energy targets. EU countries have committed to 2010 renewable
energy targets[2] and discussions on more ambitious 2020 targets (up to
20% of renewable energy) have begun, driven to a large extent by energy
security and environmental concerns (including the Kyoto Protocol).
Renewable energy is forecast to be a significant component in meeting new
demand (IEA 2003). However these targets are unlikely to be met with
current policies and measures.
Liberalisation and new capacity. In Western Europe since the 1990s the
energy sector (in particular the electricity sector) has undergone
significant liberalisation and privatisation, resulting in declining and
more volatile (fluctuating) electricity prices. Existing fossil fuel and
nuclear generators, established with public money and benefiting from
depreciated assets have lower marginal costs than new renewable
technologies and are better able to manage the downward price pressures.
Volatile energy prices have created barriers to private investment in new
capacity, resulting in falling reserve margins compared to those present
in the 1990s as the replacement of old capacity lags behind retirement.
Carbon dioxide emissions. Annual power sector emissions are expected to
rise by a third in EU-15 by 2030 as a result of forecasted increase in
energy demand during the same period (IEA 2003). A substantial number of
fossil fuel plants in Europe are projected to retire. However, the
required increased capacity investments might give rise to pressure to
defer decommissioning decisions. If fossil fuel plants remain in
operation longer than currently assumed in the projections C02 emissions
will be much higher.
      3.  Energy Subsidies - Overview
Traditionally, energy sector support has been justified on the basis of
growth, as high or volatile energy prices can dampen other areas of
economic activity. State intervention in energy markets can normally be
described as having one of the following three aims:
Security of Supply: Since the oil crisis of the 1970s, governments have
used subsidies to ensure adequate domestic supply. Subsidies have been
provided specifically for indigenous fuel sectors in order to minimise
import dependency. Energy subsidies play an important role in a wider geo-
political context, and foreign policy objectives may influence funding
for the domestic energy sectors.
Environmental Improvement: Energy subsidies can also be used to reduce
pollution (SO2, Nox, particulates or greenhouse gas emissions, and to
fulfil responsibilities under related international protocols and
treaties. These activities reflect government action to address market
imperfections in the pricing of external environmental costs in the price
of energy.
Economic Benefits: Energy subsidies may be used to support and stimulate
the wider economy through lower energy input prices. They can also
provide opportunities for supply and export in the energy technology
markets. Energy subsidies may be deployed as part of an investment in
regional employment and social cohesion, and in managing periods of
economic transition.
Subsidy reform is resisted for a range of reasons, commonly known as
lock-in mechanisms.  Those in receipt of economic support may use their
economic and political influence to maintain a given subsidy regime (rent
seeking). On an international stage, individual governments find it
difficult to pursue subsidy reform or elimination for fear of losing
competitiveness if other nations do not pursue a similar agenda.
Arguments may also be made that the removal of subsidies will not result
in the desired positive effects (e.g. abolition of domestic coal
subsidies may lead to a switch to cheaper imported coal, rather than
renewable sources), or that subsidised industries return more to the
state in tax than they receive.
Defining Energy Subsidies
There is no internationally agreed definition of energy sector subsidies.
Within the EU, only the Producer Subsidy Equivalent is reported for the
coal industry on an annual basis, but this mechanism only reflects direct
budgetary transfers, and does not include other areas of indirect
support.
The OECD (2003) defines subsidies as follows:
any measure that keeps prices for consumers below market levels, or for
producers above market levels or that reduces costs for consumers and
producers
Narrow definitions that refer to a direct cash payment to an energy
producer or consumer ignore a range of other indirect support mechanisms,
including tax measures, trade restrictions and regulatory frameworks
(purchase obligations and price controls) that provide effective economic
assistance. Table 1 provides an overview of the various types of support.

                                  Source: Table adapted from IEA/UNDP (2002)
The last item in the table is the most complex and controversial, as it
refers to a lack of government intervention (i.e. a failure to ensure
that all costs and benefits are reflected in prices). The failure to
impose external costs is not a subsidy in the traditional sense, but
nonetheless, these external costs remain a transfer from the private to
the public domain. External costs vary considerably between energy
sources, and were these to be accurately reflected in price, certain
sectors would benefit at the expense of others. The difficulty comes in
quantifying these external costs with a level of certainty that the
energy sector can agree upon, and these have therefore not been included
in our total estimate.
Direct subsidies are those that are paid directly to industrial producers
or consumers and appear on national balance sheet as government
expenditure. They may include grants to producers, often to support
commercialisation of technology or industry restructuring, and to
consumers. Direct subsidies also include low interest or reduced-rate
loans, administered by government or directly by banks with state
interest rate subsidy.  Such loans are not suitable for commercially high-
risk technologies, as projects must generate cash flow for debt
repayment. In these circumstances, grants are more appropriate.
Indirect Subsidies are those not paid directly to producers or consumers
of energy. They may be explicit (involving a cash payment, such as
research and development (R&D) grants for research institutions), or
implicit (where the benefit must be calculated on the basis of
differential treatment between competing fuels, or between the energy
sector and other areas of the economy.
Taxation policy is a key mechanism of indirect energy market support.
While generating government revenue, its application also contributes to
stimulating the supply of and demand for specific fuels. Taxation may be
used to internalise environmental externality costs (such as the
imposition of carbon dioxide taxes), creating an indirect benefit for
carbon neutral fuel sources, or to convert policy objectives related to
energy security and diversity into market signals (IEA 2003b)
A fuel may be exempted from certain taxes, or enjoy lower rates of value
added tax (VAT) and excise duty in relation to other fuels or to the
wider economy. Tax exemptions and incentives allowing both industry and
consumers to offset costs can be provided for investments in the energy
sector and for the installation of energy related materials and
equipment. Accelerated tax depreciation may also be permitted, allowing
energy related equipment to be amortised (the costs written off) more
quickly than normal accounting standards would allow. Taxation
instruments are less administratively costly and complex than direct
subsidies, and do not require initial allocation of funds.
It may be argued that taxation differentials and other environmentally
oriented policy instruments that seek to internalise external costs
should not be regarded as subsidies, but rather as market corrections and
the proper work of government. What is more complex is assessing how well
governments have linked environmental taxation to actual environmental
costs and outcomes. There is little evidence that instruments such as
carbon taxation are accurately linked to the level of emissions of
individual plants. For example, there is little differentiation at
national level between older and newer plants.
Calculating the benefits from taxation exemptions is rather complicated.
Tax rebates are usually on per volume basis, and therefore to obtain the
total exemptions or rebates on fuels, detailed volume data of consumption
or production is required. These indirect subsidies are implied, that is
their size is calculated on the basis of differential treatment against a
norm or baseline.  Judgement must also be made on the source of
comparison to calculate the implied subsidy. If all fuels are taxed
equally, then the subsidy is effectively zero. However, if a tax is
levied on one or more fuels, then the fuel that is exempt is effectively
subsidised. A further complication arises in that consumption of all
fuels may be taxed at a lower rate than the rest of the economy, as it is
the case with lower than standard VAT on electricity in many countries.
It remains an area of contention whether this should be considered an
energy subsidy, but has been included for the purposes of this
estimation.
Emission Trading Schemes are increasingly used as an alternative or
complement to environmental taxation, particularly for greenhouse gas
emissions. Total emissions are capped and then permits are either
allocated or auctioned. These permits can be bought and sold, allowing
member states to achieve emissions reductions at least cost, ensuring
that plant operators with the lowest marginal cost of emission abatement
act first. Current proposed and operational schemes include the UK,
Denmark, Norway and Netherlands, with the effective introduction of an
overarching European Emissions Trading Scheme planned for 2005.
Regulatory Support Mechanisms make up the other most significant area of
indirect support for the energy sector. These mechanisms most commonly
take the form of price guarantees and demand quotas for specific energy
sources, and are introduced to support environmental or energy security
policy objectives. Some of these mechanisms, such as feed in tariffs or
competitive tenders can be described as supply push mechanisms, in that
they stimulate production. Others, such as purchase obligations are
demand pull mechanisms in that they create an artificial demand to
which the market responds.
      4.  Estimating EU Subsidies
Various attempts have been made to quantify the type and amount of aid
provided to energy industries. A study by Larsen and Shah as quoted in
the UNEP (2003) report put world fossil fuel direct subsidies at $230
billion per year. There is no comprehensive official record of historic
and ongoing energy subsidies in the European Union. Collation and
presentation of information on energy sector support is fragmented and is
managed by multiple actors: energy agencies, member state governments,
the International Energy Agency (IEA), the European Commission. Only for
the narrowly defined direct state aid to the coal sector, (the Producer
Subsidy Equivalent) have member states agreed a format and annual
reporting mechanism through the IEA.
A number of studies have attempted to throw light on support for EU
energy sector over recent years. The most recent and comprehensive
reports were prepared by Oosterhuis (2001) and the European Commission
(2003a). Both are snapshots based on best available information and are
not ongoing monitoring projects. Other reports such as Eurelectric (2004)
have focussed on specific industry support mechanisms such as renewables.
This paper used a synthesis of available studies and reports to estimate
the type and size of energy subsidies across the EU. Taken together, they
provide at best an incomplete overview of energy sector support of the
period 1995-2001, indicating a total (direct and indirect) subsidy to the
energy sector of about Euro 125 billion for the period, with the heaviest
recipients in Germany, France, Spain, and the UK. Oosterhuis (2001)
estimates annual direct and indirect support to be in excess of Euro 27
billion. There is a lack of continuous and accurate over time data, and
that which exists lacks specific detail, often presented as a total sum
for multiple years with no further breakdown.
Within the scope of this paper, more detailed work has been undertaken on
a single year, 2001, which is the most recent for which reliable and
comprehensive subsidy data is available. Table 2 provides an estimated
summary of the total support provided to the various fuel sectors in 2001
at EU level. These figures should be regarded as illustrative, rather
than comprehensive due to the lack of consistent data and assumptions
made.

               Includes allocation of electricity subsidies to primary fuels
In absolute terms, solid fuels received the biggest share of direct and
indirect subsidies in 2001. As a result of the relatively young age of
the industry and their limited consumption, the renewables industry
received significantly higher support on a per energy unit basis than
other fuel sources across the majority of member states.
Support for solid fuels is split evenly between direct and indirect
support, while other sectors receive the bulk of subsidies from indirect
means, primarily taxation exemptions and regulatory price support and
purchase obligation mechanisms.
- Solid Fuels: Direct and indirect support to the coal industry is the
single most important funding regime in the EU. State financing to coal
mines was commonplace throughout the last century, and exists today in a
more rationalised form to help competition with cheap foreign imports.
Direct aid is transparent and has been reported since the ECSC Treaty
formalised state aid to the coal and steel sectors. Direct subsidies
continue to be paid to the coal industries in Germany, Spain, France, and
the UK, whereas subsidies in other countries, such as Belgium, have more
or less ceased. Germany and Spain are still committed to sustaining as
output as much as is practicable, and therefore use subsidies to reduce
producer costs, or deflating the end-user price. The UK and France
instead are using industry subsidies to support industrial restructuring.
- Oil and Gas: During the period 1995-2001, the vast majority of indirect
subsidies were accounted for by gas tax exemptions, primarily in the
Netherlands. Gas tax differentials were removed in the Netherlands in
2001. According to the European Commission (2003a), there is little aid
to investment in the oil sector. The industry across Europe is largely
privatised and receives no direct aid for oil production, transport or
storage. Overall, Italy, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have the
highest level of support in the oil and gas sector.
- Nuclear: The major nuclear generating powers, France, the UK and
Germany, were responsible for the majority of support. These subsidy
figures do not reflect the lack of full liability cover for the nuclear
industry in case of a critical nuclear accident or fuel incident. Both
commercial and state liabilities are limited under international treaty
although in practice, this risk would be too large to be commercially
insurable. Subsidy support for the nuclear industry tends to be in the
form of continued investment in Research and Development.
- Renewables: Renewable energy support is now well established across the
European Union.  Every member state provides a combination of price
support through feed in tariffs, obligations or competitive tender,
together with a range of capital subsidies and fiscal mechanisms (see
table 3). As a result, indirect support far outweighs direct support. In
2001, absolute levels of support were greatest in Italy and Germany with
over Euro 1 billion in subsidy support.

H. Historical policy, now changed
Source: Adapted from Stenzel, Foxon and Gross (2003)
Over time, total energy subsidies are declining.  While it is difficult
to make accurate over time comparisons, what is clear is that support for
renewables increased significantly over the recent years. Support for
fossil fuel has shown a gradual decline, with a significant reduction in
oil and gas support following the ending of preferential gas tax
treatment in the Netherlands. Nuclear subsidies are also in gentle
decline.
State Ownership and Transparency
It is difficult to quantify the economic benefits a firm receives from
state ownership and some concern has been expressed over the lack of
transparency regarding their internal financing and accounting practices
and there have been a number of cases concerning illegal state aid.
Across the EU, there are currently 12 national fossil fuel companies and
several large nuclear generators and providers with significant market
share in which national governments retain a majority or significant
minority share ownership. These are former state monopolies that have
played a major role in infrastructure development, production and
distribution over a number of decades. By comparison, there are no state
owned companies whose primary activity is the development and production
of renewable energy.
      5.  A Historical Perspective
During their respective inception and development phases the oil, natural
gas and nuclear industries received far greater levels of support
compared to renewables.
The fossil fuel and nuclear industries continue to benefit from state
assisted infrastructure and technology developed over a period of
decades. Oosterhuis (2001) highlights the cases of the Netherlands and
Denmark, where significant historical investment in the natural gas
network through fiscal measures and tariffs has created a gas
infrastructure that continues to develop benefits to consumers long after
the support measures have been withdrawn. Energy consumers continue to
benefit from prices lower than might be expected if similar capacity had
been funded on purely commercial terms.
Economies of Scale
An assessment of the nature of subsidies to the various fuel types must
be understood in the context of industry maturity. Nuclear and fossil
fuel technologies have now well established industries whereas the
majority of renewable energy technologies remain in their infancy. The
capital costs of renewable energy are expected to fall substantially,
making electricity production from renewables increasingly competitive
although this will be heavily influenced by regional factors.
Improvements in wind turbine technology and greater efficiencies in
biomass conversion are expected (IEA 2003). Currently, several of the
technologies are approaching commercial maturity, including onshore wind,
small-scale hydropower, biomass and solar thermal. Others such as PV are
further from market competitiveness. It is clear that all will benefit
from increased production volume and technological investment (European
Commission, 2004).

A Historical Comparison
There is little subsidy data available on Pre-1974 budgets in Europe. As
a result, it is difficult to make a comparison between the levels of
support to the different energy fuels. It is however undisputable that
the more mature fuel infrastructure has benefited significantly by
support received under state ownership in the form of research and
development (R&D), capital investment and operation costs.
Renewable energy has an increasing share of total R&D funding (Table 4).
However, renewable technologies have consistently received much less
support than nuclear fission and fusion. This is not easy to comprehend
for an industry still in growth phase.

Research undertaken in the United States[5] provides a useful indicator
of the respective levels of total subsidy support for nuclear power and
wind at similar stages of technology development. Goldberg (2000)
estimates that the nuclear industry received about thirty times more
support per kWh output than wind power in the first 15 years of industry
development (Table 5).

The study indicates that the support for industrial and technological
development for nuclear when compared to other renewable sources over a
period of 15-25 years created a competitive advantage for nuclear in
terms of economies of scale.
      6.  Addressing Market Failures
The areas of subsidy previously highlighted are examples of government
intervention, both explicit and implicit, in energy markets in order to
achieve pre-determined economic, social, environmental or political
outcomes. Another aspect of the states relationship with the energy
market must also be raised, the failure to intervene in the case of
market failure. This study examines two such specific areas.
Environmental Externality Costs
Fuel cycle externalities are the costs imposed on society and the
environment that are not accounted for by the producers and consumers of
energy, i.e. that are not included in the market price. They include
damage to the human health, the natural and built environment, and
include such elements as effects of air pollution, occupational disease
and accidents. They also include the external costs of climate change.
In theory, if the costs of energy sector external impacts are known, they
should be allocated to the fuel activity concerned. This way producers,
consumers and decision makers could get accurate price signals and reach
optimal decisions about how to use the resources. In practice the
measurement of environmental impacts and associated costs is a complex
and evolving science and neither markets nor governments effectively
price these costs. Before this can happen, sound methodologies must be
developed to define and measure actual impacts and to aggregate from
individual measurements to sector and geography based models. EU
governments have recognised this and have invested in modelling, in
particular through the European Commission on going ExternE project.
Table 6 shows the aggregated ranges of external costs associated with the
electricity production fuel cycle in the EU as calculated with data from
ExternE.

ExternE research has demonstrated so far that renewable energy sources
have significantly lower environmental impact per KWh than fossil fuel
sources and similar impacts to nuclear power[7], without the same risk of
accident.
It should be noted that environmental costs are in fact indirectly
imposed through the setting of air quality, air emission and GHG emission
targets that are based partly on cost-benefit-analyses and partly on
political calculations. Emissions trading schemes have the aim of making
these reductions more cost effective, although allocation processes have
been difficult in many EU states. In addition as mentioned in section 3
environmental taxation policies also aim to partly internalise external
costs.
Valuing Energy Security  Applying Portfolio Theory
Managing the risk associated with energy supply is an increasingly
important policy driver.  Security of energy supply covers a wide range
of issues from ensuring adequate fuel supply, generation technology and
distribution infrastructure, to developing diversity and self-sufficiency
of energy resources. In economic terms, risk is best measured by price
volatility.  Governments have traditionally made planning decisions for
new capacity based upon the lowest cost option between different fuel
types.  This has tended to support more established fuel sectors rather
than renewable technologies, which have higher costs but which may have
other benefits in terms of diversifying supply and reducing import
dependence.  With investment decisions transferred to the private sector
and downward pressure on electricity prices, the demand for lowest cost
options has become even greater.
This creates problems for energy planners, who have recognised that
current market designs do not guarantee an adequate level of security of
supply. (IEA 2003).  Over-reliance on fossil fuels can increase fuel
price volatility - the likelihood that energy prices will fluctuate more
widely and more often  and expose economies to significant macroeconomic
costs.[8]
A number of studies have been completed or are underway to examine the
use of portfolio theory in reducing risk and potential costs. They have
all demonstrated that by adding renewables to current fossil fuel
dominated energy portfolios, price risk can be effectively hedged.[9]
Awerbuch and Berger (2003) have compared year 2000 and projected 2010 EU
electricity generation mix and concluded that risk can be reduced by
adjusting the conventional mix and including larger shares of wind or
similar renewable technologies and that any expansion in natural gas
should be accompanied by an increased deployment of renewables.
The presence of each primary fuel in an energy portfolio with minimized
risk has a real economic value, but this is currently disconnected from
mainstream discussion on subsidy mechanisms. Further work needs to be
done to quantify the economic benefits of risk and cost management to
ascertain the extent to which the potential benefits of renewables are
reflected by current levels of support. What is clear is that the role of
renewable technologies in diversifying energy price risk is not yet fully
recognised by the market.

[1] There has been reduction in market price support to coal production
 over the past years in a number of member states and this has led to
 reductions in coal production in these countries. These reductions may
 lead to domestic coal being replaced in the short term, at least in part
 by imported coal, in which case the environmental benefits may be rather
 small (Mountford, 2000). However in the medium and longer terms, as the
 markets react to the ensuing higher coal prices, there would probably be
 increased use of gas and renewables (OECD, 2004).
[2] The targets indicate a 12% share of gross inland energy consumption
 by 2010 and a 22% share of electricity produced from renewable energy
 sources by 2010 (European Parliament and Council 2001)
[3] The methodology used to calculate these figures follows the work of
Oosterhuis (2001) and includes a broad range of direct and indirect
energy support mechanisms, including implied subsidies arising from
taxation differentials and the effects of regulatory price support.
Subsidies for electricity have been allocated to primary energy sources
using the share of thermal inputs into electricity production.  Figures
given are broad estimates.  These data have been compiled from a range of
primary (IEA R&D and Renewables Database (2004), EU State Aid scorecard
(2004), IEA Energy taxes and prices (2003)) and secondary sources,
including Eurelectric (2004), European Commission (2003), Oosterhuis
(2001).
[4] A high proportion of generation capacity in the United States since
 1945 has typically been in private ownership rather than state
 controlled. This has resulted in a greater level of transparency in
 financial transfers and support than has been the case for EU member
 states.
[5] Figures based upon average high/low estimates of external cost data
 per KWh from External Costs European Commission report (2003) and 2000
 Gross Electricity Production Data (Eurostat). These figures are
 estimates only, and are present with the caveats outlined by the ExternE
 team including extrapolation of data to an EU wide perspective. They are
 intended to provide an indicative range and should be treated with
 caution.  There has been some criticism of the methodology used in the
 ExternE study. In particular, there remain uncertainties in the monetary
 valuation of mortality effects, and from the omission of some impacts on
 ecosystems due to acidification, eutrofication and global warming. In
 addition, the study does not take into account contamination of water
 and soil, and the impact of long-term accumulation effects.
[6] Nuclear externalities exclude high level wastes impacts, nuclear
 proliferation and impacts of terrorism which have been considered too
 difficult to value. In the same way, the risk of nuclear power accidents
 has not been fully priced. Oosterhuis (2001) reports that there have
 been various estimates of the economic cost of a large-scale nuclear
 accident, ranging from Euro 83 billion to 5469 billion. Liability for
 nuclear accidents is currently limited by the Paris (1960) and Vienna
 (1963) Conventions and the Joint Protocol (1988). The liabilities can be
 as little as Euro 6.5 million for a single nuclear operator to Euro 390
 million for national public liability. The risks associated with the
 use of nuclear energy () are socialised, because the producers are not
 fully liable for the damage (see Irrek 2002).
[7] A number of studies have modelled the link between increases in oil
 price and reduction in economic activity as expressed in terms of GDP.
 They have estimated that a 10% rise in the oil price might cut GDP
 growth by 1.5% for a period of 3-6 months following the price increase.
 Extrapolating this to the EU 15, would result in GDP reductions of
 between Euro 35 and 70 billion. These calculations reflect a rise in
 price, rather than the effects of volatility itself and more work is
 required in this area.
[8] Portfolio modellers seek to identify the mix of assets that generate
 the most economically efficient outcome for a given level of risk by
 incorporating the concept of Beta  a measure of the variance of the
 portfolio and thus the risk associated with it: they maximise the
 expected return for any given level of risk, while minimising risk for
 every given level of expected return (Awerbuch and Berger 2003)

Aid to the coal sector
Direct aid to the EU coal industry is authorised under a Council
Regulation that replaced the expired ECSC treaty in July 2002. This
allows for the continued support of domestic coal mining in the four coal
producing member states. In 2001, under the ECSC treaty, the amount of
aid granted was approximately Euro 6.3 billion. Member states also
provide indirect support to promote the use of solid fuels in electricity
generation, and are allowed under Directive 96/92/EC to give priority to
electricity produced using indigenous sources up to a 15% limit.
Tax Incentives for Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas
Producer countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark, support
to exploration and production through the use of the taxation system.
     In the UK, taxation levied on new gas fields developed since 1993
      has been lowered, creating an incentive for investment, especially
      for smaller gas fields or fields where exploration is difficult.
     Denmark has abolished the payment of royalties on gas and oil
      production.
     Tax exemptions have been provided to less profitable Dutch gas
      fields
     Ireland has implemented a pre-exploration preferential tax scheme
      for oil
 Direct infrastructure subsidies to the Gas Industry in the EU
 Direct aid to the gas industry through infrastructure development
remains permitted by the EU to
  Promote the economic development of a region where the standard of
   living is low and create jobs;
  Extend the gas network to guarantee security of supply and to extend
   the use of an energy source whose combustion generates lower emissions
   than burning coal or oil;
  Be in line with EU policy, in particular with regard to developing
   trans-European energy networks.
National aid occurs mostly in Spain, Greece, Ireland, and Denmark.
Direct subsidies are also provided to the gas industry by the European
Union.  Between, 1996-2000 these included structural funds of (2 billion,
and (3billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
An overview of regulatory support mechanisms for renewable energies
Fixed Feed in Tariffs have been widely deployed throughout Europe to
support renewable technologies, most notably in Germany, Denmark and
Spain. Governments set a tariff price at which the countrys supply
companies must purchase all renewable energy delivered to the
distribution grid. Price premiums are passed on to consumers in the form
of higher electricity prices.
Competitive Tender invites producers to bid to provide specific amounts
and types of renewable energy from the market at cap or below cap prices.
Contracts are then signed with the lowest cost bid to deliver output over
a number of years. Consumers pay the premium on wholesale price through a
levy.
Purchase Obligations set targets for consumption of electricity (usually
percentage based) that should be sourced from a certain fuel source. This
mechanism has been deployed for renewables and combined heat and power in
several member states. Energy distribution companies must prove the
origin of purchase, pay a penalty or produce the required amount
themselves, creating an artificial demand and price premium for renewable
generation. If the overall system target cannot be met, prices rise until
new market entrants and investors are attracted. Tradeable certificates
often accompany such schemes. The cost of this subsidy is borne by
consumers.

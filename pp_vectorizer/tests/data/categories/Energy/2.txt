for major energy fuels and issues related to electricity and the environment.
The International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) presents
an assessment by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the outlook for international energy markets through 2025. U.S. projections appearing in
IEO2003 are consistent with those published in EIAs
Annual Energy Outlook 2003 (AEO2003), which was prepared using the National Energy Modeling System
(NEMS). IEO2003 is provided as a service to energy
managers and analysts, both in government and in the
private sector. The projections are used by international
agencies, Federal and State governments, trade associations, and other planners and decisionmakers. They are
published pursuant to the Department of Energy
Organization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-91), Section
205(c). The IEO2003 projections are based on U.S. and
foreign government policies in effect on October 1, 2002.
Projections in IEO2003 are displayed according to six
basic country groupings (Figure 1). The industrialized
region includes projections for nine individual countriesthe United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdomplus the subgroups Other Europe and Australia/
New Zealand. The developing countries are represented
by four separate regional subgroups: developing Asia,
Africa, Middle East, and Central and South America.
China, India, and South Korea are represented in developing Asia; Brazil is represented in Central and South
America; and Turkey is represented in the Middle East.
The nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union (EE/FSU) are considered as a separate country
grouping.
The report begins with a review of world trends in
energy demand. The historical time frame begins with
data from 1970 and extends to 2001, providing readers
with a 31-year historical view of energy demand. In
IEO2003, for the first time, the IEO projections extend to
2025, giving readers a 24-year forecast period.
High economic growth and low economic growth
cases were developed to depict a set of alternative
growth paths for the energy forecast. The two cases
consider alternative growth paths for regional gross
domestic product (GDP). The resulting projections and
the uncertainty associated with making international
energy projections in general are discussed in the
first chapter of the report. The status of environmental
indicators, including global carbon emissions, is
reviewed. Comparisons of the IEO2003 projections with
other available international energy forecasts are
included in the first chapter, as well as comparisons of
historical data with projections published in earlier
IEOs.
The next part of the report is organized by energy
source. Regional consumption projections for oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, and renewable energy
(hydroelectricity, geothermal, wind, solar, and other
renewables) are presented in the five fuel chapters,
along with a review of the current status of each fuel on a
worldwide basis. A chapter on energy consumed by
electricity producers follows. The report ends with a discussion of energy and environmental issues, with particular attention to the outlook for global carbon emissions.
Appendix A contains summary tables of the IEO2003
reference case projections for world energy consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption by fuel, electricity consumption, carbon emissions,
nuclear generating capacity, energy consumption measured in oil-equivalent units, and regional population
growth. The reference case projections of total foreign
energy consumption and consumption of oil, natural
gas, coal, and renewable energy were prepared using
EIAs System for the Analysis of Global Energy Markets
(SAGE), as were projections of net electricity consumption, energy consumed by fuel for the purpose of electricity generation, and carbon emissions. In addition, the
National Energy Modeling Systems (NEMS) Coal
Export Submodule (CES) was used to derive flows in
international coal trade, presented in the coal chapter.
Nuclear capacity projections for the reference case were
based on analysts knowledge of the nuclear programs
in different countries.
Appendixes B and C present projections for the high and
low economic growth cases, respectively. Appendix D
contains summary tables of projections for world oil
production capacity and oil production in the reference
case and two alternative cases: high oil price and low oil
price. The projections were derived from SAGE and
from the U.S. Geological Survey. Appendix E contains
summary tables of projections for nuclear capacity in
three nuclear growth cases. Appendix F describes the
SAGE model.

Objectives of the IEO2003 Projections
The projections in IEO2003 are not statements of what will happen, but what might happen given the specific
assumptions and methodologies used. These projections provide an objective, policy-neutral reference case
that can be used to analyze international energy markets. As a policy-neutral data and analysis organization,
EIA does not propose, advocate, or speculate on future legislative and regulatory changes. The projections are
based on U.S. and foreign government policies effective as of October 1, 2002. Assuming fixed policies, even
knowing that changes will occur, will naturally result in projections that differ from the final data.
Models are abstractions of energy production and consumption activities, regulatory activities, and producer
and consumer behavior. The forecasts are highly dependent on the data, analytical methodologies, model
structures, and specific assumptions used in their development. Trends depicted in the analysis are indicative
of tendencies in the real world rather than representations of specific real-world outcomes. Even where trends
are stable and well understood, the projections are subject to uncertainty. Many events that shape energy markets are random and cannot be anticipated, and assumptions concerning future technology characteristics,
demographics, and resource availability cannot be known with certainty.
1 Turkey and Belarus are Annex I nations that have not ratified the Framework Convention on Climate Change and did not commit to
quantifiable emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2001, the United States withdrew from the Protocol, and Kazakhstan requested
that it be added to the list of Annex I countries.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Highlights
World energy consumption is projected to increase by 58 percent from 2001 to 2025.
Much of the growth in worldwide energy use is expected in the
developing world in the IEO2003 reference case forecast.
In the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference case, world energy consumption is projected to
increase by 58 percent over a 24-year forecast horizon,
from 2001 to 2025. Worldwide, total energy use is projected to grow from 404 quadrillion British thermal units
(Btu) in 2001 to 640 quadrillion Btu in 2025 (Figure 2).
As in past editions of this report, the IEO2003 reference
case outlook continues to show robust growth in energy
consumption among the developing nations of the
world (Figure 3). The strongest growth is projected for
developing Asia, where demand for energy is expected
to more than double over the forecast period. An average annual growth rate of 3 percent is projected for
energy use in developing Asia, accounting for nearly 40
percent of the total projected increment in world energy
consumption and 69 percent of the increment for the
developing world alone.
Expectations for growth in Central and South America
have been lowered substantially from those reflected in
last years report. Political and economic problems
surfacing among the nations of the region in the past
year have tempered the previously optimistic mid-term

outlook for their development. There is continuing
unrest in Venezuela; the Argentine economy remains in
crisis; the Colombian government has recently renewed
an aggressive campaign against insurgency groups; and
there is growing dissatisfaction with the Toledo government in Peru. The uncertainties associated with these
developments have led to lower projections for the
regions energy demand in the IEO2003 forecast. Whereas energy demand in Central and South America was
projected to grow by 3.8 percent per year between 1999
and 2020 in last years report, the IEO2003 reference case
projects average annual growth of only 2.4 percent from
1999 through 2020 (Figure 4).
The IEO2003 reference case expects world oil prices to
remain high and volatile throughout 2003, largely
because of the abnormally high stock builds that would
be needed to bring oil markets back into balance following the disruption in Venezuelan and Iraqi exports.
After 2004, prices are expected to return to the mid-term
price trajectory anticipated in last years outlook (Figure
5). World oil prices are projected to reach $27 per barrel
in 2001 dollars ($48 per barrel in nominal dollars) at the
end of the projection period.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Outlook for World Energy Demand
Much of the industrialized world remained in an economic slowdown in 2002. Growth in the United States
was hindered by high world oil prices and several large
corporate scandals that shook consumer confidence. The
sluggish U.S. economy, in turn, had an adverse impact
on many global markets that depend heavily on exports
to the United States. The mid-term forecast assumes that
growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and energy
demand will rebound toward the trend projected in last
years outlook. The IEO2003 reference case projects 1.3percent average annual growth for energy consumption
in the industrialized world between 2001 and 2025, similar to growth rate projected in last years report.
In the IEO2003 reference case, world oil consumption is
projected to increase by 1.8 percent annually over the
24-year projection period, from 77 million barrels per
day in 2001 to 119 million barrels per day in 2025. The
projected increases in worldwide oil use would require
an increment of a little more than 42 million barrels per
day over current productive capacity. OPEC producers
are expected to be the major beneficiaries of increased
production requirements, but non-OPEC supply is
expected to remain competitive, with major increments
of supply coming from offshore resources, especially in
the Caspian Basin, Latin America, and deepwater West
Africa. Deepwater exploration and development initiatives are generally expected to be sustained worldwide,
and the offshore Atlantic Basin is expected to emerge as

Projections for Energy Consumption in
Central and South America, 1990-2025
a major source of oil production in both Latin America
and Africa.
Over the past several decades oil has been the worlds
foremost source of primary energy consumption, and it
is expected to remain in that position throughout the
2001 to 2025 period. Oils share of world energy drops
only slightly in the forecast, from 39 percent in 2001 to 38
percent in 2025, despite expectations that countries in
many parts of the world will be switching from oil to
natural gas and other fuels for their electricity generation (Figure 6). Robust growth in transportation energy
useoverwhelmingly fueled by petroleum products
is expected to continue over the next 24 years. As a
result, oil is projected to retain its predominance in the
global energy mixnotwithstanding increases in the
penetration of new technologies such as hydrogenfueled vehicles.
Although the nations of the industrialized world continue to consume more of the worlds petroleum products than do those of the developing world, the gap is
projected to narrow considerably over the forecast
period. In 2001, developing nations consumed about
two-thirds (64 percent) as much oil as the industrialized
nations; by 2025 they are expected to consume around 86
percent as much as the industrialized nations. In the
industrialized world, increases in oil use are expected
mainly in the transportation sector, where there are few
economically competitive alternatives at present. In the
developing world, oil demand is projected to grow in all

end-use sectors. As the energy infrastructures of emerging economies improve, people are turning from traditional fuels for residential and commercial usessuch
as wood burning for heating and cookingto electricity,
and industrial demand for petrochemical feedstocks is
increasing.
The fastest growing source of primary energy in the
IEO2003 reference case is projected to be natural gas.
Over the 2001-2025 forecast period, consumption of natural gas is projected to nearly double in the reference
case, to 176 trillion cubic feet in 2025. Natural gas use is
expected to surpass coal use (on a Btu basis) by 2005, and
by 2025 it is expected to exceed coal use by 31 percent
(Figure 7). The natural gas share of total energy consumption is projected to increase from 23 percent in 2001
to 28 percent in 2025, and natural gas is expected to
account for the largest increment in electricity generation (increasing by 41 quadrillion Btu and accounting for
53 percent of the total increment in energy use for electricity generation). Much of the projected growth in natural gas consumption throughout the world is in
response to rising demand for natural gas to fuel efficient new gas turbine power plants.
In the industrialized world, natural gas is expected to
make a greater contribution to incremental energy consumption among the major fuels, increasingly becoming
the fuel of choice for new power generation capacity
because of its environmental and economic advantages.
In the developing countries, increments in natural gas
use are expected to supply both power generation and
industrial uses. The IEO2003 reference case projects
strong growth in natural gas use in the developing
worldaveraging 3.9 percent per year between 2001
Figure 6. World Energy Consumption Shares
by Fuel Type, 2001, 2010, 2020, and 2025
Percent of Total
and 2025reflecting the growing popularity of the fuel
as well as the expectation that the relatively immature
gas markets of emerging countries will develop quickly
in the coming years.
World coal use has been in a period of generally slow
growth since the 1980s, and the trend is expected to continue through the projection period. The projected slow
growth in coal consumption, averaging 1.5 percent per
year through 2025, suggests that coal will account for a
shrinking share of world energy consumption. In the
IEO2003 reference case, the coal share of total energy
consumption is projected to fall from 24 percent in 2001
to 22 percent by 2025. Substantial declines in coal use are
projected for Western Europe and the EE/FSU countries, where natural gas (and in the case of France,
nuclear power) is increasingly being used for electricity
generation and for other uses in the industrial and buildings sectors. The expected decline in coals share of
energy use would be even greater were it not for projected large increases in coal use in developing Asia,
especially in China and India, where coal continues to
dominate many fuel markets. As very large countries in
terms of both population and land mass, and with ample
domestic coal resources, China and India are projected
to account for 75 percent of the total expected increase in
coal use worldwide (on a Btu basis).
Almost 55 percent of the coal consumed worldwide is
used for electricity generation, and its role in the future
is expected to be primarily as a fuel for power generation
and secondarily as an energy source in a few key industrial sectors, such as steelmaking. Where coal is used in
the industrial, residential, and commercial sectors, other
energy sourcesprimarily, natural gasare expected to

gain market share. One exception is China, where coal
continues to be the most widely used fuel in the countrys rapidly growing industrial sector, reflecting the
Chinas abundant coal reserves and limited access to
other sources of energy. Consumption of coking coal is
projected to decline slightly in most regions of the world
as a result of technological advances in steelmaking,
increasing output from electric arc furnaces, and continuing replacement of steel by other materials in end-use
applications.
Nuclear power accounted for 19 percent of the worlds
total electricity supply in 2001. The IEO2003 reference
case projects a drop in the nuclear share of electricity, to
12 percent by 2025, as the current trend away from
nuclear power in most countries continues. Although
some nations are expected to construct new nuclear
power plants during the forecast period, declines in
nuclear capacity are projected for most of the countries
with active nuclear power programs as older plants are
retired. The economics of nuclear generating capacity
generally compare unfavorably with other available
technologies, and public concerns about plant safety,
radioactive waste disposal, and weapons proliferation
are expected to contribute to the decline of nuclear
power in the long term.
Despite its declining share of global electricity production in the IEO2003 reference case forecast, nuclear
power will continue to be a significant source of electricity. Life extensions, higher capacity factors, and capacity
uprates are expected to offset some of the capacity losses
resulting from retirements. Further, some nations still
are expected to continue building new units. Most future capacity additions are expected in Asia, with China,
India, Japan, and South Korea projected to add a combined 45 gigawatts between 2001 and 2025. As of February 2003, the nations of developing Asia accounted for
17 of the 35 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, including 8 in India, 4 in China, 2 each in South
Korea and Taiwan, and 1 in North Korea.
Consumption of hydroelectricity and other renewable
resources is projected to increase only moderately in the
IEO2003 reference case, at an average annual rate of 1.9
percent per year between 2001 and 2025. Renewable
energy sources are not expected to be economically competitive with fossil fuels in the mid-term without significant support from government policies that would
encourage their widespread expansion. Much of the
growth in use of renewable energy is expected to result
from the operation of new large-scale hydroelectric facilities in the developing world, particularly in developing
Asia. Among other nations in the region, China, India,
Malaysia, and Vietnam are currently constructing or
planning large-scale hydroelectric projects. The first
electricity generating units of Chinas 18,200-megawatt
Three Gorges Dam project are scheduled to be installed
in 2003; India is set to begin the final phase of reservoir
filling for its 2,000-megawatt Tehri dam; and Malaysia
has awarded the main construction contract for its
2,400-megawatt Bakun dam.
Over the projection period, worldwide net electricity
consumption is projected to increase at an average
annual rate of 2.4 percent, from 13.9 trillion kilowatthours in 2001 to 24.7 trillion kilowatthours in 2025.
Strong growth in electricity use is expected in the countries of the developing world, particularly developing
Asia, where robust economic growth is projected to
support increased demand for electricity to run newly
purchased home appliances for air conditioning, refrigeration, cooking, and space and water heating. Chinas
electricity consumption is projected to nearly triple,
growing by an average of 4.3 percent per year in the reference case. Slower growth in population and economic
activity, as well as market saturation and efficiency
gains for some electronic appliances, is expected to
result in a more modest growth rate for electricity use in
the industrialized world, at 1.7 percent per year.
International investments in the electricity sector have
changed course to some extent in recent years. First,
much of the massive U.S. investment in foreign electricity ventures that began in the mid- to late 1990s
particularly in South America, Western Europe, and
Australiahas slowed, in part because of the sluggish
state of the global economy but also because of disappointing financial performance of many acquisitions.
Foreign direct investment in the electricity sectors of the
developing world has slowed as well, and the level of
such activity in 2001 was only about one-fifth of the 1997
peak level. Mergers and acquisitions among U.S. electricity firms have also slowed substantially since peaking in 1999. Finally, the move toward electricity market
restructuringanother trend that flourished in the
1990sis also changing. Although some countries,
including South Korea and Mexico, still are pursuing
restructuring programs, others have delayed or modified their restructuring plans. For example, the United
Kingdom has reformed its electricity pool in response to
evidence of market manipulation, and in Ontario, Canada, a program of electricity price decontrol was
reversed after a weather-related spike in retail prices in
the summer of 2002.
Carbon Dioxide Emissions
Because estimates indicate that approximately 80 percent of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions currently come from fossil fuel combustion, world energy
use has emerged at the center of the climate change
debate. In the IEO2003 reference case, world carbon
dioxide emissions are projected to rise from 6.5 billion
metric tons carbon equivalent in 2001 to 7.7 billion
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
metric tons in 2010 and 10.4 billion metric tons in 2025
(Figure 8). Much of the projected increase in carbon
dioxide emissions is expected in the developing world
(Figure 9), accompanying the large increases in energy
use projected for the regions emerging economies.
Developing countries account for 59 percent of the projected increment in carbon dioxide emissions between
2001 and 2025. Continued heavy reliance on coal and
other fossil fuels, as projected for the developing countries, would ensure that even if the industrialized world
undertook efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,
there still would be substantial increases in worldwide
carbon dioxide emissions over the forecast horizon.
industrialized countries as a result of improving standards of living that accompany the projected economic
expansion (Figure 10).
For more than three decades, the EE/FSU has maintained a much higher level of energy intensity than
either the industrialized or developing countries. Over
the forecast horizon the regions energy intensity is
expected to improveby 2.1 percent per year on averagein concert with expected recovery from the economic and social declines of the early 1990s; however, it
is still expected to be twice as high as in the developing
world and five times as high as in the industrialized
world.
Energy Intensity
Energy intensity (that is, the relationship between
energy consumption and growth in gross domestic
product) is an important factor that affects the change in
energy consumption over time. In the industrialized
countries, history shows the link between energy consumption and economic growth to be a relatively weak
one, with growth in energy demand lagging behind economic growth. In the developing countries, the two have
been more closely correlated, with energy demand
growing in parallel with economic expansion.
Carbon Intensity
World carbon intensity has improved (decreased) substantially over the past three decades, falling from 302
metric tons per million 1997 dollars of GDP in 1970 to
202 metric tons per million 1997 dollars in 2001. Although the pace of improvement in emissions intensity
is expected to slow over the forecast period, a continuing
decline is projected in the reference case, to 154 metric
tons per million 1997 dollars of GDP in 2025.
In the IEO2003 forecast, energy intensity in the industrialized countries is expected to improve (decrease) by 1.3
percent per year between 2001 and 2025, slightly slower
than the 1.4 percent per year improvement observed in
the region between 1970 and 2001. Energy intensity is
expected to improve more rapidly in the developing
countriesby 1.7 percent per year on averageas their
economies begin to behave more like those of the
On a regional basis, the most rapid rates of improvement
in carbon intensity are projected for the transitional
economies of the EE/FSU and the developing Asian
countries of China and India. In the FSU, economic
recovery from the upheaval of the 1990s is expected to
continue throughout the forecast. The FSU nations are
also expected to replace old and inefficient capital stock
and increasingly use less carbon-intensive natural gas
for new electricity generation capacity and for other end

uses rather than more carbon-intensive oil or coal. Eastern European nations have been in economic recovery
longer than has the FSU, and natural gas is expected to
continue to displace coal use in the region, resulting in
an average 2.8-percent annual improvement (decrease)
in carbon intensity for Eastern Europe as a whole
(Figure 11).
In developing Asia, fairly rapid improvements in carbon
intensity are projected for China and India, primarily as
a result of rapid economic growth rather than a switch to
less carbon-intensive fuels. Both China and India are
projected to remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels,
particularly coal, in the IEO2003 reference case, but their
annual GDP growth is projected to average 5.9 percent,
compared with an expected 3.4-percent annual rate of
increase in fossil fuel use from 2001 to 2025.

The rate of improvement in carbon dioxide intensity
could vary considerably in the future. Technological
advances and government policy initiatives have the
potential to affect the rate of improvement in carbon
intensity, and different rates of economic improvement
could also considerably alter future carbon intensity levels. In the IEO2003 reference case, world carbon dioxide
intensity is projected to fall from 202 metric tons carbon
equivalent per million 1997 dollars of GDP in 2001 to 154
metric tons per million dollars in 2025; however, if world
economic growth expanded to the levels projected in the
high economic growth case, carbon dioxide intensity
could fall more quickly, to 142 metric tons per million
dollars in 2025. In contrast, if world GDP expanded
more slowly, as in the low economic growth case, world
carbon dioxide intensity would decline to a projected
166 metric tons per million dollars in 2025.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
World Energy Consumption
The IEO2003 projections indicate continued growth in world energy use, including
large increases for the developing economies of Asia. Energy resources are
thought to be adequate to support the growth expected through 2025.
The outlook presented in the International Energy Outlook
2003 (IEO2003) shows continuing strong growth for
worldwide energy demand over the next 24 years. Total
world energy consumption is expected to expand by 58
percent between 2001 and 2025, from 404 quadrillion
British thermal units (Btu) in 2001 to 640 quadrillion Btu
in 2025 (Table 1 and Figure 12). Overall, the global economy did not perform strongly in 2002. Growth in U.S.
markets was hindered by several large corporate scandals and by relatively high world oil prices, and the slow
U.S. economy had negative impacts on many global
markets that rely heavily on exports to the United States.
Nevertheless, the IEO2003 mid-term outlook continues
to show robust growth in energy consumption among
the developing nations of the world (Figure 13), particularly in developing Asia (including China and India),
where demand for energy is expected to more than double over the next quarter century.
This chapter begins with an overview of current economic trends that are influencing short-term energy
markets, followed by a presentation of the IEO2003 outlook for energy consumption by primary energy source
and a discussion of projections for world carbon dioxide
emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels.
Uncertainty in the forecast is highlighted by an examination of alternative assumptions about economic growth
and their impacts on the IEO2003 projections, and how
future trends in energy intensity could influence the reference case projections. Next, a comparison of IEO2003
projections with forecasts available from other
organizations is presented. The chapter ends with an
examination of the performance of past IEO forecasts for
the years 1990, 1995, and 2000.
World Economic Status
The global economy faltered at the end of 2002, and the
United States managed a meager 1-percent annualized
growth in the fourth quarter. U.S. stock markets felt the
impact of a crisis of consumer confidence following several large corporate scandals in 2002. The weak performance of the U.S. economy in 2002 was felt in world
markets as well. The United States is the worlds largest
economy, and many developing nations are largely
dependent on exports to the United States to support
their own economic expansion. Worldwide, economic
growth is expected to recover over the short term, and in
the IEO2003 reference case, world gross domestic
product (GDP) is projected to expand by an average of
3.1 percent per year over the 2001 to 2025 forecast period
(Table 2).
Continuing unrest in the Middle East, the war in Iraq,
and a crippling strike in Venezuela aiming to oust President Hugo Chavez all helped to keep oil prices high
through much of the past year and into 2003. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has
managed markets to keep the basket oil price above $22
per barrel (nominal) since March 8, 2002 (Figure 14) [1].

High world oil prices have the potential to further
dampen economic expansion. The weakness of U.S.
consumer demandwhich has supported economic
growth for some timeis matched by likely economic
declines in Japan and stagnation in the European Union
(EU). Another below-trend performance is expected for
the world economy in 2003 before recovery in 2004.

The U.S. economy has suffered a number of setbacks in
the past 3 years, including the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the significant loss of stock market wealth
since 2000, and recent corporate accounting scandals,
including U.S. energy company Enron and telecommunications company WorldCom Group [2]. Yet the recession of 2001 was one of the mildest on record, with
recovery proceeding slowly in 2002. The recovery
attributed to continuing consumer spending, a strong
housing market, and activist fiscal and monetary policieshas been slowed by falling consumer confidence,
high oil prices, and war jitters. Debates over another
government fiscal stimulus have just begun, but the
eventual outcome may well provide a significant boost
to the U.S. economy in 2003. U.S. GDP is projected to
grow at an average annual rate of 3.0 percent per year
from 2001 to 2025.
Canadas economy continued to outperform expectations in 2002. GDP growth in Canada exceeded that in
the United States between 1999 and 2002, and in 2002
Canada recorded the strongest growth among the G-8
nations [3]. Housing starts, automobile sales, strong
government spending, and a robust energy sector were
leading contributors to Canadas economic growth.
Although the pace of the countrys growth did slow in
conjunction with the general worldwide economic slowdown in 2002, it is expected to improve along with a
recovery in the United States. Canadas economic
growth rate is projected to average 2.7 percent per year
over the projection period.
Mexicowhich along with Canada is a U.S. partner in
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
also returned to positive growth in 2002. High world oil
prices helped Mexico avoid a substantial dip in GDP
expansion in 2001 and allowed the country to achieve its
2002 fiscal deficit target of 0.65 percent of GDP [4]. In
general, many analysts believe that the United States
will cushion Mexico from the economic troubles that
have hampered other countries in Latin America, and
Mexicos GDP is expected to expand by a robust 5.2 percent per year on average over the next 24 years. Mexico
is, however, more dependent on U.S. growth than are
the other Latin American countries. The Fox Administration has announced plans to limit public spending in
its 2003 budget because of fears that the U.S. recovery
may be more prolonged than was expected in 2002 [5].

Review, DOE/EIA-0035(2003/04) (Washington, DC, April
2003).
Economic performance in other industrialized regions
of the world has been equally or more lackluster. In Germany, Western Europes largest economy, economic
performance was anemic throughout 2002. The German
government had few options for stimulus: the European
Central Bank has been reluctant to cut EU interest rates
to stimulate economic growth, and Germany is constrained from carrying out any fiscal policy changes
because of the weak state of public finances and limits
placed on the government by the EUs Stability and
Growth Pact, which requires that EU member countries
maintain deficits that do not exceed 3 percent of GDP in
any single year [6]. The European Commission issued a
warning to Germany on its breach of the deficit limit,
threatening punishment if it did not take action to
reduce its deficit before May 21, 2003 [7].
High unemployment and the costs associated with
recovering from a devastating flood in the summer of
2002 have led the German government to delay a tax cut
scheduled for January 2003, leading many analysts to
believe that chances for a near-term economic recovery
are remote [8]. In December, the European Central Bank
moved to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage point, the first cut since November 2001, citing a
lackluster overall sentiment in the economy [9]. The
Bank stated that it was able to cut interest rates without
fear of inflation because of the protracted sluggishness
of economic growth among the EU member countries.
Critics of the Banks hesitancy to cut rates over the past
year argue that the impact of the November interest rate
cut may not be felt in Europe for up to a year, and that
Germany, as well as France and Italy, may fall into recession in the meantime.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In Japan, the worlds second largest economy continued
to contract in 2002. After a decade of fiscal erosion, spiraling private debt, and price deflation, the country
found itself in a position of acute vulnerability to any
external shock. The government of prime minister
Junichiro Koizumi has had only limited success in getting economic reforms passed in the Japanese Diet.
Compromise postal reform bills were passed in June
2002, allowing a shift of the national postal service and
its financial functions into a private corporation [10].
Koizumi is also attempting to shift fiscal policy away
from government stimulus packages (implemented
through public works) toward a tax cut.
In late September 2002, Koizumi announced a reshuffling of his cabinet, replacing his chief financial regulator, Hakuo Yanagisawa, with Heizo Takenaka, who is
known to be a strong proponent of reform [11]. Mr.
Takenaka has been assigned the roll of economy czar
and has been charged with the task of cleaning up commercial banks that have accumulated an estimated $423
billion in bad loans over the past 12 years. It is difficult to
assess how successful Takenaka may be, and for the
near-term future the Japanese economy is expected to
continue only tepid performance. GDP in Japan is projected to grow by only 1.8 percent per year between 2001
and 2025, substantially lower than its 3.3-percent average over the past 30 years.
Central and South America
In 2002, substantial political and economic troubles
arose among the nations of Central and South America.
Uncertainties among the nations of the region include
prospects for national elections in several large countries
that may well change the political landscape, the continuing economic crisis in Argentina, political unrest in
Venezuela, a renewed aggressive campaign against
insurgency groups in Colombia, and mounting popular
dissatisfaction with the Toledo government in Peru. As a
result, projections for the regions economic growth
have been lowered in IEO2003, along with expectations
for increments in energy demand. Whereas last years
report (IEO2002) projected 4.5-percent average annual
growth in GDP in Central and South America from 1999
to 2020, IEO2003 projects only 3.6-percent annual
growth for the same time period.
Brazils economy, the largest in Central and South
America, has been hampered by the lingering global
economic weakness. Beginning in the second quarter of
2002, industrial production in Brazil began to weaken
substantially, and unemployment rates increased precipitously. The Brazilian Central Bank lowered interest
rates from 18.5 percent to 18 percent, but the high interest rates compounded the difficulty of achieving economic recovery [12]. In mid-October 2002, in an effort to
halt the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the Bank
increased interest rates to a 3-year high of 21 percent in
the hope that high interest rates would make short-term
domestic investments more attractive by offering higher
returns on domestic bonds [13].
Mounting dissatisfaction with the performance of the
Brazilian economy fueled public support for the presidential candidacy of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who was
elected to the office on October 27, 2002, with 61 percent
of the votethe largest margin of victory by a presidential candidate in the history of the country [14]. Many
analysts believe that the election of Lula will stall privatization efforts, with policies aimed at reversing the previous administrations move to liberalize many
state-owned enterprises.
Fears that the Lula administration might be detrimental
to prospects in Brazil are making foreign investors nervous about committing investment funds, making it difficult for the country to manage its $260 billion public
debt [15]. The Lula administration does not have much
fiscal room to maneuver, however, given Brazils past
agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to hold down public deficits in return for loans and
credit. The IMF, apparently believing that Brazil intends
to honor its commitments, has approved a request for a
15-month standby credit of $30.4 billion through December 2003, citing the countrys strong and consistent
macroeconomic policies in recent years that have
improved fundamentals [16].
In Venezuela, the Chavez administration has faced
growing discontent among union workers and businessmen as a result of its handling of the economy,
particularly in dealings with state-owned Petroleos
de Venezuela (PDVSA). When Chavez attempted
to replace PDVSA executives with political allies, demonstrations and protests were launched that culminated
in an ultimately unsuccessful coup attempt in April 2002
[17]. Nevertheless, Chavez declared his intention to fulfill his complete presidential term and stay in office until
2007. Tensions in the country remained high, and a
2-month nationwide strike that began on December 2,
2002, resulted in a pronounced slowdown of operations
at PDVSA [18]. Oil is the key source of revenue for Venezuela (accounting for some 80 percent of the countrys
total export revenues). Although world oil prices
remained high in 2002, the country still saw a contraction in GDP of almost 10 percent in the second quarter of
2002, and unemployment stood at 16.4 percent. None of
these developments bodes well for near-term economic
growth in Venezuela.
Argentina, another key economy of the Central and
South American region, experienced another disappointing economic year in 2002. After a deteriorating
financial situation at the end of 2001 resulted in the
rapid succession of five presidents, Eduardo Duhalde
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
assumed the role of interim president in January 2002.
The economic situation has not shown much improvement, with real GDP contracting by 12 percent in 2002,
and new elections are now scheduled for April 2003 [19].
There are hopes that the Argentine economy has begun
to stabilize. After a year of negotiations, Argentina was
able to secure a $6.8 billion loan package from the IMF in
January 2003. Under the terms of the agreement, the IMF
has approved a short-term credit line of nearly $3 billion
to repay debts to multinational organizations that could
not be postponed. It has also extended its deadline for
repayment of some $3.8 billion to August 31, 2003. The
country faces around $18 billion worth of repayments
before the end of 2003.
Developing Asia
For the most part, the nations of developing Asia
showed positive economic growth in 2002, and there is
cautious optimism that national economies in the region
will continue to expand despite slow economic growth
in the industrialized world. The two largest economies
in the regionChina and Indiaboth saw robust GDP
growth in 2002, which is expected to continue in the near
term. China and India alone are expected to see combined average economic growth of 5.9 percent per year
from 2001 to 2025 in the IEO2003 reference case.
The November 2001 accession of China into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) gives analysts some reason
for concern in the mid-term. Although WTO membership is expected to advance trading opportunities and a
voice in future global economic organization negotiations, there is fear that unemployment may rise with the
opening of Chinas markets to competition, accompanied by the potential for social discord, and that economic growth in the short term will be dampened [20].
To counteract the potential negative impacts of WTO
membership, the Chinese government plans to increase
spending on public works projects, releasing some 150
billion yuan (about $18 billion) in special funds to
finance the projects [21]. In the mid-term, China will still
need to reform overstaffed and inefficient state-owned
companies and a banking system that is carrying large
nonperforming loans. In 2002, nonperforming loans
accounted for 23 percent of total loans, and the government has set a target for state-owned banks to reduce
them to 15 percent of the total by 2005 [22].
Indias economy has also performed well over the past 2
years, with GDP increases of 5.4 percent in 2001 and an
estimated 4.8 percent in 2002 [23] attributed to strong
growth in the manufacturing sector and a robust recovery in the agricultural sector after a 2-year drought. Several legislative moves aimed at improving the countrys
privatization efforts were passed in 2002, including a
July 2002 government announcement that it would
allow companies that assume government stakes in
businesses to finance the acquisitions through external
commercial loans, and the April 2002 abolition of the oil
refinery sectors Administered Pricing Mechanism,
which is expected to result in greater competition for
Indias refineries [24]. Indias Power Minister, Suresh
Prabhu, has announced that further legislation will be
introduced to end the monopoly of state utilities on electricity distribution, allowing private companies to sell
electricity directly to consumers. Analysts hope that the
legislation will remove the distribution restrictions that
have hampered Indias efforts to reform its power sector
and attract new foreign investment in the electricity sector [25]. Mid-term prospects for India are encouraging as
the country continues to privatize state enterprises and
increasingly adopts free market policies. In the IEO2003
reference case, Indias GDP is expected to expand by 5.2
percent per year on average between 2001 and 2025.
Economic growth in 2002 was sustained in other countries of developing Asia, with some exceptions. The pillar of economic expansion in the region continues to be
consumer demand and exports. Many Asian nations
rely on exports to the United States and other industrialized countries for revenues, and the slow economic
growth among the nations of the industrialized world
has slowed short-term growth in many of the regions
developing countries. In particular, electronics exporting countries like Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan
are hoping that a recovery in demand for computer
equipment and other electronics in the United States,
Japan, and Western Europe will spur their GDP growth
in 2003 [26].
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
Positive GDP growth continued in the transitional
economies of the former Soviet Union (FSU) in 2002 but
at slower rates than the near double-digit increases that
were reported among the regions countries in 2000 and
2001. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the
early 1990s, the regions GDP fell to $545 billion (1997
dollars) in 1998, lower than its 1970 level. The FSU
region is expected to sustain positive economic growth
between 2001 and 2025, with a projected average GDP
growth rate of 3.8 percent per year in the IEO2003 reference case.
Positive economic growth only returned to the FSU in
1999, when high world oil prices and a devalued ruble
helped Russia, the regions largest economy, post strong
economic gains by boosting performance in its industrial sector and increasing consumer demand for domestically produced goods. In 2002, the Russian ruble
continued to gather strength, making it possible for foreign goods to compete with domestic supplies. Household income also continued to improve, strengthening
domestic consumer demand. High world oil prices have
helped to support the Russian economy, but investors
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
have expressed fears that without greater transparency
and a legal framework that would protect foreign investors, such as production sharing agreements for the
energy sector, it will be difficult to attract the levels of
foreign financial investment needed to support continued advances in Russia and many of the other former
Soviet Republics [27].
As a region, Eastern Europe began to see sustained economic recovery much sooner than did the FSU countries. Most Eastern European countries saw positive
GDP growth return by the mid-1990s. Catastrophic
floods in August 2002 had strong negative impacts on
the important regional economy of the Czech Republic.
Also, the slowdown among the economies of the industrialized world dampened some demand for East European goods. Nevertheless, the nations of Eastern Europe
are expected to perform modestly well in the near term.
A strong boost for Eastern Europe came in October 2002,
when Ireland voted to accept the Nice Treaty, which
allows for the expansion of EU membership [28]. Ireland
is the only EU member that required a national referendum to approve the treaty (it was rejected by the Irish
electorate in a previous referendum). Ten countries are
to be invited to join the EU in 2004, including the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Slovakia, and Slovenia in Eastern Europe, with Bulgaria
and Romania to join in 2007. With the accessions
expected to begin in 2004, the Eastern European region
should begin to benefit from EU membership with
increased regional aid, as well as easing of trade restrictions once the EU borders have been expanded. As a
result, prospects for the region are expected to remain
positive, and its total GDP is projected to expand by an
average of 4.2 percent per year through 2025.
Outlook for Primary Energy
Consumption
The IEO2003 reference case projects that consumption of
every primary energy source will increase over the
24-year forecast horizon (Figure 15 and Appendix A,
Table A2). Much of the increment in future energy
demand in the reference case is projected to be for fossil
fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), because it is expected
that fossil fuel prices will remain relatively low, and that
the cost of generating energy from other fuels will not be
competitive. It is possible, however, that as environmental programs or government policiesparticularly those
designed to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissionsare implemented, the outlook might change, and
non-fossil fuels (including nuclear power and renewable
energy sources such as hydroelectricity, geothermal,
biomass, solar, and wind power) might become more
attractive. The IEO2003 projections assume that government policies or programs in place as of October 1, 2002,
will remain constant over the forecast horizon.
Oil is expected to remain the dominant energy fuel
throughout the forecast period, with its share of total
world energy consumption falling only slightly from 39
percent in 2001 to 38 percent in 2025. In the industrialized world, increases in oil use are projected primarily in
the transportation sector, where there are currently no
available fuels to compete significantly with oil products. The IEO2003 reference case projects declining oil
use for electricity generation, with other fuels (especially
natural gas) expected to be more favorable alternatives
to oil-fired generation.
In the developing world, oil consumption is projected to
increase for all end uses. In some countries where noncommercial fuels have been widely used in the past
(such as fuel wood for cooking and home heating), diesel generators are now sometimes being used to dissuade rural populations from decimating surrounding
forests and vegetation, most notably in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia
[29]. Because the infrastructure necessary to expand natural gas use has not been as widely established in the
developing world as it has in the industrialized world,
natural gas use is expected to grow in the developing
world, but not enough to accommodate all of the
increase in demand for energy.
Natural gas is projected to be the fastest growing primary energy source worldwide, maintaining growth of
2.8 percent annually over the 2001-2025 period, nearly
twice the rate of growth for coal use. Natural gas consumption is projected to rise from 90 trillion cubic feet in
2001 to 176 trillion cubic feet in 2025, primarily to fuel
electricity generation. Gas is increasingly seen as the
desired option for electric power, given the efficiency of

combined-cycle gas turbines relative to coal- or oil-fired
generation, and the fact that it burns more cleanly
than either coal or oil, making it a more attractive choice
for countries interested in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
Coal use worldwide is projected to increase by 2.2 billion
short tons (at a rate of 1.5 percent per year) between 2001
and 2025. Substantial declines in coal use are projected
for Western Europe and the EE/FSU countries, where
natural gas is increasingly being used to fuel new
growth in electric power generation and for other uses in
the industrial and building sectors. In the developing
world, however, even larger increases in coal use are
expected. The largest increases are projected for China
and India, where coal supplies are plentiful. Together
these two countries account for 86 percent of the projected rise in coal use in the developing world over the
forecast period.
Worldwide, consumption of electricity generated from
nuclear power is expected to increase from 2,521 billion
kilowatthours in 2001 to 2,737 billion kilowatthours in
2025. Until very recently, nuclear electricity consumption was expected to decline sharply by the end of the
forecast. The prospects for nuclear power have been
reassessed, however, in light of the higher capacity utilization rates reported for many existing nuclear facilities
and the expectation that fewer retirements of existing
plants will occur than previously projected. Further,
extensions of operating licenses (or the equivalent) for
nuclear power plants are expected to be granted among
the countries of the industrialized world, slowing the
decline in nuclear generation. In many of the industrialized countries, extending the operating life of a nuclear
power plant is a decision left primarily to the owner and
thus is essentially a question of economic viability. In the
IEO2003 reference case, world nuclear capacity is projected to rise from 353 gigawatts in 2001 to 393 gigawatts
in 2015 before falling to 366 gigawatts in 2025 (Figure
16). In contrast, in last years IEO, world nuclear capacity
was projected to rise to 363 gigawatts in 2010 and then
fall to 359 gigawatts in 2020.
The highest growth in nuclear generation is projected
for the developing world, where consumption of electricity from nuclear power is projected to increase by 4.1
percent per year between 2001 and 2025. In particular,
developing Asia is expected to see the greatest expansion in new nuclear generating capacity. As of February
2003, the nations of developing Asia accounted for 17 of
the 35 reactors currently under construction worldwide,
including 8 in India, 4 in China, 2 each in South Korea
and Taiwan, and 1 in North Korea [30], accounting for 12
of the 30 gigawatts currently under construction.
Consumption of electricity from hydropower and other
renewable energy sources is projected to grow by 1.9
percent annually in the IEO2003 forecast. With fossil fuel
prices projected to remain relatively low in the reference
case, renewable energy sources are not expected to be
widely competitive, and the renewable share of total
energy use is not expected to increase. Over the
2001-2025 forecast horizon, renewables maintain their
share of total energy consumption at 8 percent. Moreover, despite the high rates of growth projected for alternative renewable energy sources, such as wind power in
Western Europe and biomass and geothermal power in
the United States, much of the growth in renewable
energy sources will result from large-scale hydroelectric
power projects in the developing world, particularly
among the nations of developing Asia. China, India,
Malaysia, and Vietnam are already constructing or have
plans to construct ambitious hydroelectric projects over
the projection period.
Outlook for Carbon Dioxide
Emissions
World carbon dioxide emissions are expected to
increase by 3.8 billion metric tons carbon equivalent
over current levels by 2025growing by 1.9 percent per
yearif world energy consumption reaches the levels
projected in the IEO2003 reference case (Figure 17).
According to this projection, world carbon dioxide emissions in 2025 would exceed 1990 levels by 76 percent. Oil
and natural gas contribute about 1.5 and 1.3 billion
metric tons, respectively, to the projected increase from
2001, and coal provides the remaining 1.1 billion metric
tons carbon equivalent.
Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in the industrialized countries are expected to increase by 1.2 billion
metric tons carbon equivalent to 4.3 billion metric tons in

2025, or by about 1.3 percent per year (Figure 18). Emissions from the combustion of petroleum products
account for more than 44 percent of the total increment
expected for the industrialized world, and the increase
in emissions from natural gas is expected to be more
than twice as large as that from coal.
By 2020, carbon dioxide emissions in the developing
world (including China and India) are expected to surpass those in the industrialized countries, even though
developing countries are projected to use less energy
than industrialized countries at that time (Figure 18).
Total emissions in developing nations are expected to
increase by 2.3 billion metric tons to a total of 4.7 billion
metric tons carbon equivalent in 2025, representing
about 59 percent of the projected increment worldwide.
The sizable rise in emissions among the developing
nations is partially a result of their continued heavy reliance on coal, the most carbon-intensive of the fossil
fuels. Coal is used extensively in the developing Asia
region, which has the highest expected rate of economic
and energy growth in the forecast. Carbon dioxide emissions in developing Asia alone are projected to increase
from 1.6 billion metric tons carbon equivalent in 2001 to
3.3 billion metric tons in 2025.
projected in previous editions of this report, particularly
among the FSU countries. The region appears to be in
the midst of sustained economic recovery after the political, social, and economic upheavals that followed the
breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Emissions are not expected to increase as quickly as energy
use because of gains in energy efficiency resulting from
the replacement of old, inefficient capital stock, and
because in many countries in the region natural gas is
expected to displace coal, particularly for new electricity
generation capacity. The region may also be able to take
advantage of its lower emissions levels should a worldwide carbon trading system be enacted in the future.
Worldwide, carbon dioxide emissions per person are
projected to increase from about 1.1 metric tons in 1990
to 1.3 metric tons in 2025. Per capita emissions in the
industrialized countries remain much higher than those
in the rest of the world throughout the projection period,
increasing from 3.2 to 3.6 metric tons per person
between 1990 and 2010 and then to 4.2 metric tons per
person in 2025 in the IEO2003 reference case (Figure 19).
In the EE/FSU region as a whole, carbon dioxide emissions are not expected to return to their Soviet-era levels
during the projection period. This years reference case
projection has been revised to reflect the expectation
that coal use will not decline as precipitously as was
In December 2002 Canada and New Zealand ratified
the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [31]. As of
February 24, 2003, 104 countries plus the European
Community had ratified the treaty. Thirty of the ratifying nations are the so-called Annex I countries, which
are required to limit or reduce their greenhouse gases
relative to 1990 levels under the terms of the Protocol.2

2 As of February 24, 2003, the following Annex I countries had ratified, accepted, approved or acceded to the Kyoto Protocol: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
These 30 countries accounted for around 44 percent of
the total Annex I emissions in 1990. The Kyoto Protocol
enters into force 90 days after it has been ratified by at
least 55 of the parties to the UNFCCC, including a representation of Annex I countries accounting for at least 55
percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide emissions from
the Annex I group. Although the United States had the
largest share of Annex I emissions in 1990 at 35 percent,
even without U.S. participation the Protocol could enter
into force for other signatories. Russia has publicly
announced plans to advance ratification of the Kyoto
Protocol [32]. Because Russia accounted for 17 percent of
the 1990 Annex I carbon dioxide emissions, its ratification would bring the Protocol into force as long as Russia
meets the Protocols requirements for verifying and
monitoring emissions levels.
China and India also ratified the Kyoto Protocol in
2002. Although both countries account for significant
amounts of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions, their
ratification does not affect the implementation of the
Protocol, because neither country is an Annex I member.
In 2001, China and India together accounted for 17 percent of total world carbon dioxide emissions, as
compared with the 24-percent share made up by U.S.
emissions in 2001.
In the United States, the Bush Administration has introduced initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
intensity as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. Under
the Presidents Clear Skies and Global Climate Change
Initiatives, the United States will work to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent by 2012 [33]. Carbon
dioxide intensity is defined as the amount of carbon

EE/FSU
dioxide emitted per dollar of GDP. This measurement
illustrates the relationship between emissions and the
expansion of economic activity. The Administration
argues that reducing the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted per dollar of GDP will slow the rate of increase
in emissions without sacrificing needed economic
growth.
World carbon dioxide intensity has improved (decreased) substantially over the past three decades, falling from 302 metric tons carbon equivalent per million
1997 dollars of GDP in 1970 to 202 metric tons per million 1997 dollars in 2001 (Table 3). Although the pace of
improvement in emissions intensity is expected to slow
over the forecast period, it still continues to improve in
the reference case projections, dropping to 154 metric
tons per million 1997 dollars in 2025.
On a regional basis, the most rapid improvements in carbon dioxide intensity are expected to occur among the
transitional economies of the EE/FSU and in China and
India. In the FSU, economic recovery from the upheaval
of the 1990s is expected to continue throughout the forecast. The FSU nations are also expected to replace old
and inefficient capital stock and increasingly use less
carbon-intensive natural gas for new electricity generation and other end uses rather than the more carbon-intensive oil and coal. Eastern European nations
have been in economic recovery longer than has the
FSU, and natural gas is expected to continue to displace
coal use in the region, resulting in an average 2.8-percent
annual improvement (decrease) in carbon intensity for
Eastern Europe as a whole.
In developing Asia, fairly rapid improvements in carbon
dioxide intensity are expected for China and India over
the projection period, primarily as a result of rapid economic growth rather than a switch to less carbon-intensive fuels. Both China and India are projected
to remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, particularly
coal, in the IEO2003 reference case, but their annual GDP
growth is projected to average 5.9 percent, compared
with an expected 3.4-percent annual rate of increase in
fossil fuel use from 2001 to 2025.

A major source of uncertainty in the IEO2003 forecast is
the expected rate of future economic growth. IEO2003
includes a high economic growth case and a low
economic growth case in addition to the reference case.
The reference case projections are based on a set of
regional assumptions about economic growth paths
measured by GDPand energy elasticity (the relationship between changes in energy consumption and
changes in GDP). The two alternative growth cases are
based on alternative assumptions about possible economic growth paths (Figure 20).
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
For the high and low economic growth cases, different
assumptions are made about the range of possible economic growth rates among the industrial, transitional
EE/FSU, and developing economies. For the industrialized countries, one percentage point is added to the reference case GDP growth rates for the high economic
growth case and one percentage point is subtracted from
the reference case GDP growth rates for the low economic growth case. Outside the industrialized world
and excluding China and the EE/FSU, reference case
GDP growth rates are also increased and decreased by
1.0 percentage point to provide the high and low economic growth case estimates.
Because China had particularly high, often double-digit
growth in GDP throughout much of the 1990s, it has the
potential for a larger downturn in economic growth. In
contrast, the EE/FSU region suffered a severe economic
collapse in the early part of the decade and has been trying to recover from it with mixed success. The EE/FSU
nations have the potential for substantially higher economic growth if their current political and institutional
problems moderate sufficiently to allow the recovery of
a considerable industrial base. As a result of these uncertainties, 2.5 percentage points are subtracted from the
reference case GDP assumptions for China to form the
low economic growth case, and 1.0 percentage point is
added to the reference case to form the high economic
growth case. For the EE/FSU region, 1.0 percentage
point is subtracted from the reference case assumptions
to derive the low economic growth case, and 2.5 percentage points are added for the high economic growth case.
The IEO2003 reference case shows total world energy
consumption reaching 640 quadrillion Btu in 2025, with
the industrialized world projected to consume 288

quadrillion Btu, the transitional EE/FSU countries 82
quadrillion Btu, and the developing world 270 quadrillion Btu. In the high economic growth case, total world
energy use in 2025 is projected to be 763 quadrillion Btu,
123 quadrillion Btu (or 62 million barrels of oil equivalent) higher than in the reference case (Figure 21). Under
the assumptions of the low economic growth case,
worldwide energy consumption in 2025 would be 98
quadrillion Btu (or 49 million barrels of oil equivalent)
lower than in the reference case, at 542 quadrillion Btu.
Thus, there is a substantial range of 221 quadrillion Btu,
or about one-third of the total consumption projected for
2025 in the reference case, between the projections in the
high and low economic growth cases. Corresponding to
the range of the energy consumption forecasts, carbon
dioxide emissions in 2025 are projected to total 8.6 billion metric tons carbon equivalent in the low economic
growth case (1.8 billion metric tons less than the reference case projection of 10.4 billion metric tons carbon
equivalent) and 12.4 billion metric tons carbon equivalent in the high economic growth case (2.0 billion metric
tons higher than the reference case projection).
demand and economic growth have been more closely
correlated in the past, with energy demand growth tending to track the rate of economic expansion.
The historical behavior of energy intensity in the FSU is
problematic. Since World War II, the EE/FSU economies
have had higher levels of energy intensity than either the
industrialized or the developing countries. In the FSU,
however, energy consumption grew more quickly than
GDP until 1990, when the collapse of the Soviet Union
created a situation in which both income and energy use
declined, but GDP fell more quickly and, as a result,
energy intensity increased. Over the forecast horizon,
energy intensity is expected to decline in the region as
the EE/FSU nations continue to recover from the economic and social problems of the early 1990s. Still,
energy intensity in the EE/FSU is expected to be more
than double that in the developing world and five times
that in the industrialized world in 2025 (Figure 22).
Another major source of uncertainty surrounding a
long-term forecast is the relationship of energy use to
GDP over time. Economic growth and energy demand
are linked, but the strength of that link varies among
regions and their stages of economic development.
In industrialized countries, history shows the link to
be a relatively weak one, with energy demand lagging
behind economic growth. In developing countries,
The stage of economic development and the standard of
living of individuals in a given region strongly influence
the link between economic growth and energy demand.
Advanced economies with high living standards have a
relatively high level of energy use per capita, but they
also tend to be economies where per capita energy use is
stable or changes very slowly. In the industrialized
countries, there is a high penetration rate of modern
appliances and motorized personal transportation
equipment. To the extent that spending is directed to
energy-consuming goods, it involves more often than
not purchases of new equipment to replace old capital
stock. The new stock is often more efficient than

the equipment it replaces, resulting in a weaker link
between income and energy demand.
Changing growth patterns of energy intensity could
have dramatic impacts on energy consumption in the
projection period, particularly among the developing
countries. For instance, if energy intensities in each
of the developing countries are assumed to improve
(decline) annually by a percentage equal to the single
greatest annual improvement recorded between 1990
and 2000, energy intensity in the developing world as a
whole would fall by 74 percent between 2001 and 2025.
Historically, the average of the largest single-year
improvements in energy intensity for each of the developing nations has been 5 percent, and the single-year
improvements for individual developing countries have
ranged from 9 percent (China) to 1 percent (Brazil). If
energy intensity in each of the developing countries
improved annually over the forecast period at the highest historical rate of improvement recorded for each
country in a single year, their combined energy consumption in 2025 would be 105 quadrillion Btu, as compared with the reference case projection of 270
quadrillion Btu.
If, on the other hand, energy intensity in each of the
developing countries changed annually at the lowest
historical rate of improvement (or the highest rate of
worsening) recorded for a single year from 1990 to 2000,
energy intensity in the developing world as a whole
would increase (worsen) by 169 percent between 2001
and 2025. Historically, the average of the largest singleyear increases in energy intensity for each of the

developing nations (including the smallest historical
decreases in countries where energy intensity has
improved every year) has been 4 percent, ranging from
an increase of 10 percent (South Korea) to a decrease of
4 percent (China). If energy intensity in each of the
developing countries worsened (increased) annually
over the forecast period at the highest historical rate
recorded for each country in a single year (or improved
by the lowest rate recorded for each country where
energy intensity has improved every year), their combined energy consumption in 2025 would be 1,078 quadrillion Btu68 percent higher than the reference case
projection.
Forecast Comparisons
Three organizations provide forecasts comparable to
those in IEO2003. The International Energy Agency
(IEA) provides business as usual projections to the
year 2030 in its World Energy Outlook 2002. Petroleum
Economics, Ltd. (PEL) and Petroleum Industry Research
Associates (PIRA) publish world energy forecasts to the
year 2015. For this comparison, 2000 is used as the base
year for all the forecasts (because IEA does not publish
data for any other historical years), and the comparisons
extend only to 2020. Although IEAs forecast extends to
2030, it does not publish a projection for 2025.
Regional breakouts among the forecasting groups vary,
complicating the comparisons. For example, IEO2003
includes Mexico in North America and IEA includes
Mexico in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) North America, but the two other
forecasts include Mexico in Latin America. As a result,
for purposes of this comparison, Mexico has been
removed from North America in the IEO2003 projections and added to Central and South America to form a
Latin America country grouping that matches the
other series. PIRA includes only Japan in industrialized
Asia, whereas industrialized Asia in the IEO2003 forecast comprises Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
IEO2003 includes Turkey in the Middle East, but IEA
includes Turkey, as well as the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, in OECD Europe (which is designated as Western Europe for this comparison). PEL
also places Turkey in Western Europe but includes the
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in Eastern
Europe, as does IEO2003. Although most of the differences involve fairly small countries, they contribute to
the variations among the forecasts.
All the forecasts provide projections out to the year 2010
(Table 4). The growth rates for energy consumption
among the reference case forecasts for the 2000-2010
time period are similar, ranging between 1.9 and 2.1 percent per year. All the forecasts for total energy consumption fall well within the range of variation defined by the
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
IEO2003 low and high economic growth cases; in fact, all
are within a range of 0.2 percentage points around the
IEO2003 reference case.
The regions for which the largest variations are seen
among the forecasts are the Middle East and Africa, with
more moderate differences in the projections for Latin
America, developing Asia, and the EE/FSU. For both
the Middle East and Africa the projected average annual
growth rates vary by 1.4 percentage points among the
reference case forecasts. For the Middle East, IEO2003
projects the lowest growth in energy demand in the
region at 2.3 percent per year between 2000 and 2010.
PEL projects the highest average growth for the Middle
East in the 2000-2010 period, at 3.7 percent per year. The
PEL and PIRA projections exceed the upper range
defined by the IEO2003 high economic growth case,
demonstrating the great uncertainties among the forecasts about the political and economic future of this
region in the next decade. For Africa, IEO2003 also projects the slowest growth in energy use between 2000 and
2010 at 1.9 percent per year, and IEA projects the highest
growth rate at 3.3 percent per year. Both the IEA and
PEL projections are higher than the IEO2003 high economic growth case estimate of 2.6 percent per year.
For Latin America, the projected growth rates for the
2000 to 2010 time period vary by 0.9 percentage points
among the forecasts, ranging from 2.1 percent per year
(PIRA) to 3.0 percent per year (IEA). Only the IEA forecast exceeds the IEO2003 high economic growth case
estimate of 2.6 percent. Projections for the EE/FSU differ
by a range of 0.8 percentage points, varying from
1.7-percent annual growth in energy demand between
2000 and 2010 (PEL) to 2.5 percent per year (PIRA). The
IEO2003 reference case projects that energy use in the
EE/FSU will increase by 2.3 percent per year over the
period.
IEO2003, PIRA, and PEL provide forecasts for energy
use in 2015, the end of the PEL and PIRA forecast horizons (Table 5), and their projections for worldwide
growth in energy consumption between 2000 and 2015
are similar, ranging from 1.9 percent per year (PEL) to
2.2 percent per year (PIRA), with IEO2003 expecting
average annual growth of 2.0 percent. Regionally, however, there are some differences in the expectations for
growth in energy demand, particularly in the industrialized world. Both PIRA and PEL are much more pessimistic about economic expansion in industrialized Asia.
PEL expects Japan, Australia, and New Zealand to experience almost no growth in energy use over the 20002015 period (0.2 percent per year), whereas IEO2003 projects 1.2-percent annual growth. The PEL forecast falls
well below the lower bound of 0.6 percent per year
defined by the IEO2003 low economic growth case.

the United States and Canada are lower in the IEA
forecast than in the IEO2003 reference case. IEO2003 also

in Africas energy consumption, projecting 3.4-percent
average annual growth between 2000 and 2020, well in
excess of the IEO2003 high economic growth case projection of 2.8 percent per year.
Finally, the projections vary not only with respect to levels of total energy demand but also with respect to the
composition of primary energy inputs. All the forecasts
provide energy consumption projections by fuel in 2010
(Table 7). In terms of oil consumption, all the forecasts
expect similar growth worldwide between 2000 and
2010. Oil demand is projected to increase by between 1.5
percent per year (IEO2003) and 1.8 percent per year
(PIRA). All the forecasts expect natural gas use to grow
more rapidly than other fuels between 2000 and 2010
and nuclear power to grow more slowly than any other
fuel. The projections for growth in coal use vary among
the forecasts, from 1.4 percent per year (PEL and IEA) to
2.2 percent per year (PIRA), with IEO2003 projecting
1.6-percent average annual growth from 2000 to 2010.
Although IEA projects the slowest growth among the
forecasts for coal, it projects the highest growth rate for
renewable energy sources (2.8 percent per year), making
up for any shortfall in projected coal use.
PEL, PIRA, and IEO2003 provide world energy consumption projections by fuel for 2015 (Table 8). The
three forecasts offer similar views of the future use of
natural gas, which is the fastest growing primary fuel
type for each forecast between 2000 and 2015, ranging
from 2.8 percent per year (IEO2003) to 3.3 percent per
year (PIRA). In all the forecasts, the slowest growth is
projected for nuclear power. The IEO2003 reference case
projection for growth in nuclear power consumption, at
1.1 percent per year, is higher than the two other forecasts (PEL, 0.3 percent per year and PIRA, 0.4 percent
per year).
IEO2003 and IEA are the only forecasts that provide projections for 2020 (Table 9). The IEA forecast shows
slower projected growth than the IEO2003 forecast for
every fuel type except renewable energy; however, the
overall trends are similar in the two forecasts, with
growth in natural gas use expected to exceed that for oil
and coal and nuclear power expected to be the slowest
growing energy source over the 2000-2020 time period.

Performance of Past IEO Forecasts
for 1990, 1995, and 2000
In an effort to measure how well the IEO projections
have estimated future energy consumption trends over
the 19-year history of the series, we present a comparison of IEO forecasts produced for the years 1990, 1995,
and 2000. The forecasts are compared with actual data
published in EIAs International Energy Annual 2001, as
part of EIAs commitment to provide users of the IEO
with a set of performance measures to assess the forecasts produced by this agency.
The IEO has been published since 1985. In IEO85, midterm projections were derived only for the worlds market economies. That is, no projections were prepared for
the centrally planned economies (CPE) of the Soviet
Union, Eastern Europe, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Laos,
Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam. The IEO85 projections extended to 1995 and included forecasts of energy
consumption for 1990 and 1995 and primary consumption of oil, natural gas, coal, and other fuels. IEO85
projections were also presented for several individual
countries and subregions: the United States, Canada,
Japan, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, other OECD Europe, other OECD
(Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. Territories),
OPEC, and other developing countries. Beginning with
IEO86, nuclear power projections were published separately from the other fuel category.
Regional aggregations have changed from report to
report. In 1990, the report coverage was expanded for
the first time from only the market economies to the
entire world. Projections for China, the FSU, and other
CPE countries were provided separately. Starting with
IEO94, the regional presentation was changed from market economies and CPE countries to OECD, Eurasia
(China, FSU, and Eastern Europe), and Rest of World.
Beginning in 1995 and essentially continuing until the
current issue, the regional presentation changed to
further group the world according to economic development: industrialized nations (essentially the OECD
before the entry of South Korea and the Eastern European nations, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and
Slovakia), transitional economies of the EE/FSU, and
the developing world (including China and India).
The forecast time horizon has also changed over the
years (Table 10). In the first edition of the report, IEO85,
projections were made for 1990 and 1995. IEO86 saw the
addition of projection year 2000. In IEO91, forecasts
were no longer published for 1990, but forecasts for 2010
were added to the report. The projection horizon remained the same until IEO96, when projection year 2015
was added. In 1998, the forecast was extended again, out
to 2020 and this year the IEO2003 forecast extends to
2025 for the first time.

Comparisons of Forecasts for Market Economies
Projections for market economies were made in the eight
issues of the IEO that were published between 1985 and
1993 (no IEO was published in 1988). Historical data for
total regional energy consumption in 1990 show that the
IEO projections from those early years were consistently
lower than the actual data for the market economies. For
the four editions of the IEO printed between 1985 and
1989 in which 1990 projections were presented, total

projected energy consumption in the market economies
ran between 3 and 7 percent below the actual amounts
published in the International Energy Annual 2000 (Figure
23).
In addition, market economy projections for 1995 in the
1985 through 1993 IEO reports (EIA did not release forecasts for 1995 after the 1993 report) were consistently
lower than the actual, historical 1995 data (Figure 24).
Most of the difference is attributed to those market economy countries outside the OECD. Through the years,
EIAs economic growth assumptions for OPEC and
other market economy countries outside the OECD have
been low. The 1993 forecast was, as one might expect, the
most accurate of the forecasts for 1995, but its projection
for OPEC and the other market economy countries was
still more than 10 percent below the actual number.
Similarly to the year 1995 projections, year 2000 projections were also consistently lower than actual 2000 data
in each of the IEOs published between 1986 and 1993
(Figure 25). The consumption estimates for the market
economies increased in each edition, from 265 quadrillion Btu in IEO86 to 292 quadrillion Btu in IEO93. Even
as late as 1993, the IEO forecasts were underestimating
consumption of all energy sources in the market economies, by between 2 percent (oil) and 7 percent (natural
gas and nuclear power).

As noted above, in the 1994 edition of the IEO, the regional aggregation market economies was dropped
altogether and replaced with delineation of member
countries of the OECD, Eurasia, and Rest of World
(ROW). As a result of that reorganization, it is not

oil would account for only about 40 percent of total
energy consumption for the market economies in 1995,
whereas oil actually accounted for 45 percent of the total
in 1995.
Comparisons of Forecasts for Year 1995
The 1995 forecasts for world coal consumption that
appeared in the IEOs printed between 1990 and 1993
were consistently high, between 3 and 19 percent higher
than actual coal use (Figure 29), largely because of overestimates for the FSU and Eastern Europeregions that
experienced substantial declines in coal consumption
IEO90 marked the first release of a worldwide energy
consumption forecast. In IEO90 through IEO93, the forecasts for worldwide energy demand in 1995 were
between 1 and 4 percent higher than the actual amounts
consumed (Figure 26). Much of the difference can be
explained by the unanticipated collapse of the Soviet
Union economies in the early 1990s. The IEO forecasters
could not foresee the extent to which energy consumption would fall in the FSU region. In IEO90, total energy
consumption in the FSU was projected to reach 67 quadrillion Btu in 1995. The projection was reduced steadily
in the next three IEO reports, but even in IEO93 energy
demand for 1995 in the FSU region was projected to be
53 quadrillion Btu, as compared with actual 1995 energy
consumption of 43 quadrillion Btua difference equivalent to about 5 million barrels of oil per day.

Forecasts for 1995 can also be compared in terms of their
depiction of the fuel mix. Every IEO after 1990 projected
the share of each energy source relative to total energy
consumption within 3.5 percentage points of the actual
1995 distribution. The earliest IEOs tended to be too optimistic about the growth of coal use in the market economies (Figure 27) and too pessimistic about the recovery
of oil consumption after the declines in the early 1980s
that followed the price shocks caused by oil embargoes
in 1973 and 1974 and the 1979-1980 revolution in Iran
(Figure 28). The IEO85 and IEO86 reports projected that

during the years following the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Most of the projections for the FSU by fuel were
greater than the actual consumption numbers, with the
exception of hydroelectricity and other renewable
resources (Figure 30). Natural gas use did not decline as
much as oil and coal use, because gas is a plentiful
resource in the region and was used extensively to fuel
the domestic infrastructure; however, even the IEO estimates for 1995 natural gas use were 16 to 22 percent
higher than the actual use.
The IEO projections for total energy consumption in
China were below the actual 1995 consumption level
in IEO90 (by 13 percent) and IEO91 (by 8 percent) but
higher in IEO92 (by 6 percent) and about the same
in IEO93. The underestimates in the earlier IEOs balanced, in part, the overestimates for the EE/FSU countries; however, even the 4- to 17-percent underestimate
of projected 1995 coal use in China could not make up
for the 30- to 54-percent overestimate of FSU coal use. In
terms of other fuels, the IEO forecasts consistently overestimated Chinas gas consumption and underestimated
its oil consumption. Nuclear power forecasts were fairly
close for China, within 5 percent of the actual consumption (Figure 31). It is noteworthy, however, that consumption of natural gas and nuclear power was quite
small in 1995, so that any variation between actual historical consumption and the projections results in a large
percentage difference. EIA consistently underestimated
economic growth in China. As late as 1993, EIA expected
GDP in China to grow by about 7.3 percent per year during the decade of the 1990s, whereas it actually grew by
10.7 percent per year between 1990 and 1995.

Ten editions of the IEO report contained worldwide
forecasts for the year 2000 (IEO90 through IEO99). The
forecasts of total world energy consumption for 2000
were all above, but within 5 percent of, the actual total
(Figure 32). IEO97 provided the highest estimate of
world energy use in 2000. This may seem surprising at
first glance, but it is also true that the economic recession
that would take hold in 1998 among the emerging economies of southeast Asia had not occurred and was not
foreseen in the IEO97 forecast. In fact, IEO97 overestimated year 2000 energy use in developing Asia by 10
quadrillion Btu, or about 14 percent (Figure 33) and in
industrialized Asia by 2 quadrillion Btu (8 percent). Projections for the EE/FSU in IEO97 were also too optimistic, overestimating the rate of economic recovery in the
region and as a result overestimating the growth in

IEO97 did not anticipate the August 1998 devaluation of
the Russian ruble and economic recession that followed
in the FSU region. By IEO99, total EE/FSU energy
use had been adjusted downward to 52 quadrillion
Btujust slightly lower than the regions actual consumption in 2000.
The projections for year 2000 by fuel were mixed in
terms of accuracy. For all energy sources except coal,
total world consumption forecasts fell within 12 percent
of the actual levels. As was the case with forecasts for the
years 1990 and 1995, world coal consumption projections were consistently high relative to actual consumption in 2000. The world coal forecast presented in IEO90
was 30 percent higher than actual 2000 values. The forecasts for the CPE countries were responsible for the large
discrepancy between projected IEO90 and actual coal

consumption in 2000. In fact, IEO90 projected that the
market economies would consume 2,801 million short
tons of coal in 2000, and the actual estimate for coal use
among the market economies was 2,904. However, in
the CPE countriesincluding the EE/FSUIEO90 projected that coal use would climb to 3,841 million short
tons in 2000, whereas actual coal consumption was only

the FSU. As noted above, IEO90 did not foresee the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1990 when the report projections were prepared. Indeed, coal use in the FSU in
IEO90 was expected to expand to 1,132 million short
tons in 2000, whereas in reality coal use in the FSU began
to decline precipitously after 1990, hitting a low of 391
million short tons in 1998 before edging up somewhat to
421 million short tons in 2000. The story was similar for
Eastern Europe and the other CPE countries (excluding
China), where coal use in 2000 was overestimated by 157
percent in IEO90.
The year 2000 forecasts for oil, natural gas, and hydroelectricity and other renewable energy sources were, for
the most part, higher than actual levels. In contrast, projections for nuclear power were consistently lower than
the actual 2000 values. Interestingly, the forecasts for the
United States were largely responsible for the underestimation. Even in IEO99the latest IEO that included
projections for 2000analysts were expecting nuclear
power to begin to decline. In IEO90 there was widespread pessimism about the future of nuclear power in
the mid-term, given the aftermath of Chernobyl and the
problems associated with nuclear waste disposal. In the
political climate of the early 1990s, IEO90 could not
anticipate the life extensions and consistently improving
efficiencies that have allowed nuclear power plants to
generate more electricity and operate with shorter
downtimes for maintenance, even without expanding
their installed capacities.
The comparison of IEO projections and historical data in
the context of political and social events underscores the
importance of those events in shaping the worlds
energy markets. Such comparisons also point out how
important a models assumptions are to the derivation
of accurate forecasts. The political and social upheaval in
Eastern Europe and the FSU dramatically affected the
accuracy of the projections for the region. If higher economic growth rates had been assumed for China, more
accurate forecasts for that region might have been
achieved. It is important for users of the IEO or any other
projection series to realize the limitations of the forecasts. Failing an ability to predict future volatility in
social, political, or economic events, the projections
should be used as a plausible path or trend for the future
and not as a precise prediction of future events.

World Oil Markets
In the IEO2003 forecast, periodic production adjustments by OPEC members are not expected
to have a significant long-term impact on world oil markets. Prices are projected to rise
gradually through 2025 as the oil resource base is further developed.
Throughout most of 2002, crude oil prices were solidly
within the range preferred by producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), $22 to
$28 per barrel for the OPEC basket price (see Figure 14
on page 9). OPEC producers have been demonstrating
disciplined adherence to announced cutbacks in production. Early in 2003, a dramatic upward turn in crude
oil prices was brought about by a combination of two
factors. First, a general strike against the Chavez regime
resulted in a sudden drop in Venezuelas oil exports.
Although other OPEC producers agreed to increase production to make up for the lost Venezuelan output, the
obvious strain on worldwide spare capacity kept prices
high. Second, price volatility was exacerbated by fears of
war in Iraq.
Although the labor turmoil in Venezuela appears to be
ending, world oil prices are expected to remain near $30
per barrel (for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, in
nominal dollars) throughout most of 2003, mainly because of the war in Iraq and its aftermath. Due to differences in crude oil qualities, such a price is consistent
with the lower portion of the OPEC price band. A softening of oil prices is anticipated in 2004 but is not expected
to endure if OPEC maintains its recent successes in market management through production cutbacks. OPEC
producers might find it more challenging to firm up oil
prices over the next few years, however, given the
expected increase in non-OPEC supply. They not only
will have to demonstrate discipline within their own
ranks but also may try to convince selected non-OPEC
producers of the merits of production cutbacks. It
remains to be seen whether such a coalition of OPEC and
non-OPEC producers can demonstrate the restraint necessary to influence production objectives. Despite evidence that OPEC has achieved some of its price goals in
recent years, production cutback strategies have historically had mixed success.
World oil consumption rose in 2002 by about 300 thousand barrels per day, scattered evenly among the industrialized nations (mainly North America) and
developing nations (mainly Asia). Although the developing Asian economies are no longer in recession, their
current growth is modest by comparison with their
rapid economic expansion during the early and mid1990s. Latin Americas oil demand has also shown only
modest growth since 1999. In the former Soviet Union
(FSU), where oil demand grew in 2000 for the first time
in more than a decade, there were slight increases in
demand in both 2001 and 2002. In 2003, world oil
demand is expected to grow by about 1.2 million barrels
per day [1].
OPEC members have agreed to production increases
that will add whatever volumes are necessary to replace
the lost Venezuelan and Iraqi output. It is anticipated
that the increases will somewhat temper any price escalation, but that uncertainty about post-war Iraq will
keep the world oil price (U.S. refiner acquisition cost for
imports) higher than market fundamentals might
dictate.
OPECs recent successes have been the result of tight
market conditions and disciplined participation by
OPEC members. Currently, spare production capacity
worldwide is low, and OPECs consensus building is
easier as a result. Non-OPEC production is expected to
show significant increases in the near future, however,
and several members of OPEC have announced plans to
expand production capacity over the next several years.
In an oil market environment with substantial spare production capacity, it will be more difficult for OPEC to
achieve unanimity among its members.
Although non-OPEC producers have been somewhat
slow in reacting to higher oil prices, there remains significant untapped production potential worldwide, especially in deepwater areas. The lag between higher prices
and increases in drilling activity seems to have increased
in the aftermath of the low price environment of 1998
and 1999; nevertheless, non-OPEC production increased
by 700 thousand barrels per day in 2001 and by an additional 1 million barrels per day in 2002, and it is expected
to increase by an impressive 1.4 million barrels per day
in 2003. Almost one-half of the total increase in
non-OPEC production over the next 2 years is expected
to come from the FSU. The remainder of the expected
increase is evenly divided between producers in industrialized nations and those in developing economies.
Incorporating the recent price turbulence into the construction of an intermediate- and long-term oil market
outlook is difficult and raises the following questions:
Will prices remain in OPECs preferred range in
response to production cutback strategies, or will the
anticipated increase in non-OPEC production temper
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
the market? Will sustained and robust economic growth
in developing countries return in the aftermath of the
severe setback to the Asian economies in 1997-1999? Will
new technology guarantee that oil supply development
will move forward even if a low world oil price environment returns?
Although oil prices rose by almost $10 per barrel over
the course of 2002 and promise to go even higher in 2003,
those developments are not indicative of the trend in
the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference
case. In the short term, oil prices are expected to reflect
the market uneasiness brought about by the war in Iraq.
From anticipated high levels throughout 2003, oil prices
are projected to decline significantly to $23.27 in 2005
before rising by about 0.7 percent per year to $26.57 in
2025 (all prices in 2001 dollars unless otherwise noted).
When the economic recovery in Asia is complete,
demand growth in developing countries throughout the
world is expected to be sustained at robust levels.
Worldwide oil demand is projected to reach almost 119
million barrels per day by 2025, requiring an increment
to world production capability of more than 42 million
barrels per day over current capacity. OPEC producers
are expected to be the major suppliers of increased production, but non-OPEC supply is expected to remain
competitive, with major increments to supply coming
from offshore resources, especially in the Caspian Basin,
Russia, Latin America, and deepwater West Africa.
Over the past 25 years, oil prices have been highly volatile. In the future, one can expect volatile behavior to
recur principally because of unforeseen political and
economic circumstances. It is well recognized that tensions in the Middle East, for example, could give rise to
serious disruptions of normal oil production and trading patterns. On the other hand, significant excursions
from the reference price trajectory are not likely to be
sustained over long periods. High real prices deter consumption and encourage the emergence of significant
competition from marginal but large sources of oil and
other energy supplies; persistently low prices have the
opposite effects.
Limits to long-term oil price escalation include substitution of other fuels (such as natural gas) for oil, marginal
sources of conventional oil that become proved reserves
(i.e., economically viable) when prices rise, and nonconventional sources of oil that become proved reserves
at still higher prices. Advances in exploration and production technologies are likely to bring down prices
when such additional oil resources become part of the
reserve base. The IEO2003 low and high world oil price
cases suggest that the projected trends in growth for oil
production are sustainable without severe oil price escalation. There are some oil market analysts, however,
who find this viewpoint to be overly optimistic, based
on what they consider to be a significant overestimation
of both proved reserves and ultimately recoverable
resources.
Highlights of the IEO2003 projections for the world oil
market are as follows:
The reference case oil price projection shows a dramatic increase from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the
Venezuelan labor strike and the war in Iraq, a brief
decline through 2005, and a modest 0.7-percent average annual increase out to 2025.
Deepwater exploration and development initiatives
are generally expected to be sustained worldwide,
with the offshore Atlantic Basin emerging as a major
future source of oil production in both Latin America
and Africa. Technology and resource availability can
sustain large increments in oil production capability
at reference case prices. The low price environment
of 1998 and early 1999 did slow the pace of development in some prospective areas, however, especially
the Caspian Basin region.
Economic development in Asia is crucial to the
long-term growth of oil markets. The projected evolution of Asian oil demand in the reference case
would strengthen economic ties between Middle
East suppliers and Asian markets.
Although OPECs share of world oil supply is projected to increase significantly over the next two
decades, competitive forces are expected to remain
strong enough to forestall efforts to escalate real oil
prices significantly. Competitive forces operate
within OPEC, between OPEC and non-OPEC
sources of supply, and between oil and other sources
of energy (particularly natural gas).
The uncertainties associated with the IEO2003 reference case projections are significant. The war in Iraq,
the international war on terrorism, uncertain economic recovery in developing Asia and Japan, the
success of Chinas economic reforms and its political
situation, the social unrest in Venezuela, Brazils
impact on other Latin American economies, and economic recovery prospects for the FSU all increase the
risk of near-term political and policy discontinuities
that could lead to oil market behavior quite different
from that portrayed in the projections.
World Oil Prices
The near-term price trajectory in the IEO2003 reference
case is considerably different from that in IEO2002. Last
years reference case price path did not reflect the
upward price pressure in 2003 brought about by the situations in Iraq and Venezuela. In the longer term, oil
prices in both the IEO2003 and IEO2002 reference cases
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
are projected to rise gradually over the last two decades
of the forecast period; however, IEO2003 projects average annual increases of 0.7 percent, as compared with 0.5
percent in the IEO2002 forecast. The more robust price
growth in the IEO2003 reference case reflects the recognition that OPEC has been able to adhere to a production
cutback strategy for the purpose of firming up prices.
Three possible long-term price paths are shown in
Figure 34. In the reference case, projected prices in 2001
dollars reach $26.57 in 2025. (In nominal dollars, the reference case price is expected to exceed $48 in 2025.) In
the low price case, prices are projected to reach $19.04 by
2009 and to remain at about that level out to 2025. In the
high price case, prices are projected to reach $32.95 by
2015 and to remain at about that level out to 2025. The
leveling off in the high price case results from projected
market penetration of alternative energy supplies that
could become economically viable at that price level.
In all the IEO2003 oil price cases, oil demand is expected
to rise significantly over the projection period. The projected rise in oil consumption ranges from a low of 36
million barrels per day in the high price case to a high of
48 million barrels per day in the low price case. There is
widespread agreement that resources are not a key constraint on world demand to 2025. Rather more important
are the political, economic, and environmental circumstances that could shape developments in oil supply and
demand.

World oil demand is projected to grow to 119 million
barrels per day by 2025 in the IEO2003 reference case.
Over the forecast period, oil remains the fuel of choice in
the transportation sector worldwide, and almost
three-quarters of the projected increase in oil demand
from 2001 to 2025 comes from the transportation sector,
particularly in developing countries that currently have
a lower proportion of transportation fuels in their
energy mix.
During the outlook period, global economic growth, the
main driver of oil demand growth, is expected to average 3.1 percent per year. The highest rates of economic
growth from 2001 to 2025 are expected in developing
Asia, led by China and India at 6.2 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. As a result, the developing countries
share of world oil demand is projected to increase from
36 percent in 2001 to 43 percent in 2025, with a corresponding drop in the industrialized countries share
from 57 percent in 2001 to 50 percent in 2025. In absolute
terms (Figure 35), the largest regional increases in oil
demand are projected for North America (12.2 million
barrels per day) and developing Asia (15.0 million barrels per day).
The smallest increase is projected for Western Europe,
where transportation and other end-use infrastructures
are more mature and population growth is relatively
slow. Even so, the large amount of oil used for transportation in Western Europe ensures that oil will continue
to be the dominant fuel used in Europe, accounting for

North America
North America is the largest consumer of oil in the
world, accounting for more than one-fourth of total demand in 2001 (Figure 36). Oil consumption in the transportation sector currently represents 66 percent of North
Americas total oil demand. That share is expected to
continue to increase as oil use declines in other end-use
sectors (for example, natural gas is expected to displace
most oil use for electricity generation).
Among the different refined petroleum products consumed, the strongest growth in demand in North American oil markets is projected for gasoline. In contrast, jet
fuel consumption, estimated at 1.9 million barrels per
day in 2001, has been declining in the wake of airline
industry troubles since 2000 and the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC,
using civilian airplanes. When the prices of jet fuel
reached a peak at the end of 2000, many carriers added
fuel charges to their ticket and cargo prices. Jet fuel
prices eased in 2001, weakened by the U.S. economic
slowdown, but new security measures are now becoming an important cost component for airlines that may
further depress demand growth.
Oil demand in the United States is projected to grow by
1.7 percent per year to 29.2 million barrels per day in
2025 from 19.6 million barrels per day in 2001. Most of
the growth is projected for the transportation sector,
with cars and light truck fleetsincluding sport utility
vehicles (SUVs)being the largest consuming segment

of the sector. The airlines industry is expected to be
struggling for the next 5 years before positive growth in
jet fuel demand resumes for the rest of the outlook
period.
In 2002, U.S. automakers began offering generous
financing deals for SUVs and other passenger vehicles to
bolster demand levels. SUVs now form a distinctive part
of the U.S. landscape. There were a reported 66
SUV/sport wagon models on sale in the United States
during 2001, and some estimates expect that number to
rise to more than 80 models by 2005. Some other estimates suggest that the SUV share of the U.S. market
could rise by 40 percent over the next 5 years, with the
market share for crossover vehicleswhich share some
characteristics of the station wagon segmentpossibly
rising by as much as 58 percent [2].
Despite their popularity with the public, SUVs remain a
controversial choice of vehicle because of their relatively
low fuel economies. Ironically, some observers point to
the original introduction of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards during the 1970s as being instrumental in pushing automakers toward building SUVs.
With those standards allowing average fuel economy of
27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon
for light truck fleets, automakers claim that they were
unable to build larger sedans for bigger families and,
instead, sought refuge by building up their product
mixes towards light trucks. The comparatively low
prices of both vehicles and vehicle fuels in the United
States as compared with much of the rest of the world
have allowed SUVs to remain sufficiently economical
for U.S. consumers to buy and runfar more so than in
Western Europe, for example.
As in the United States, the transportation sector is the
major source of oil demand growth in the Canadian
market; however, the Canadian federal government ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2002 and is moving to introduce regulations that could slow the trend. In
the IEO2003 reference case, oil demand in Canada is
expected to grow by 1 percent per year on average, to 2.4
million barrels per day in 2025.
In Mexico, long-term economic growth is expected to
remain strong at 5.2 percent per year over the forecast
period; however, many of the reforms needed for such
growth to materialize probably will not happen in the
short to mid-term [3]. Over the long term, Mexicos
closeness to the U.S. economy and its participation in the
North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are
two major factors that should enable the country to continue on its path toward economic modernization. Oil
demand in Mexico is projected to grow by 3.2 percent
per year, from 1.9 million barrels per day in 2001 to 4.1
million barrels per day in 2025.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Western Europe
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
A decade of mediocre economic growth and the penetration of natural gas have acted to constrain overall oil
consumption in Western Europe, except in the transportation sector. Oil demand in Western Europe is projected
to grow by only 0.4 by percent per year, from 14 million
barrels per day in 2001 to 15.3 million barrel per day in
2025, with little or no increase in the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, and Italy.
In the IEO2003 reference case, total oil demand in the
FSU and Eastern Europe is projected to reach 7.9 million
barrels per day in 2020 (2.2 million barrels per day less
than projected in IEO2002) and 8.8 million barrels per
day in 2025.
Demand for diesel fuel in Western Europe has grown by
50 percent since 1990, while gasoline demand has declined marginally. Future growth in diesel demand may
be constrained, however, in light of the controversial
findings linking possible carcinogenic properties of particulate emissions to the burning of diesel fuel. In addition, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Western
European countries through the European Union reflects a general consensus over questions related to climate change, in which the vast majority of the projected
growth of carbon dioxide emissions will come from the
transportation sector [4]. In the IEO2003 reference case,
oil remains the dominant fuel used in Western Europe,
but its share of total primary energy consumption
shrinks from 42 percent in 2001 to 39 percent in 2025.
Industrialized Asia
In industrialized Asia, oil demand is expected to grow
more rapidly in Australia and New Zealand than in
Japan. Oil use in Australia and New Zealand is projected
to grow by 2.3 percent per year, from 1 million barrels
per day in 2001 to 1.7 million barrels per day in 2025,
reflecting higher expectations for population growth
and economic expansion. In Japan, the projected increase averages only 0.8 percent per year, from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2001 to 6.5 million barrels per
day in 2025. In absolute terms, oil consumption in New
Zealand is lower than that in Australia or Japan; however, moderate improvements in New Zealands economic growth outlook are accompanied by a higher
projected growth rate for oil demand through 2025 [5].
In 2002, Japans oil demand fell for the third consecutive
year. Demand for fuel oil by large industries and electric
utilities continued to fall as a result of Japans prolonged
economic recession. Between September and December
2002, there was an unexpected increase (some 130
thousand barrels per day) in demand for fuel oil in
Japans electricity sector as a result of a series of nuclear
reactor shutdowns [6]. Operation of as many as 17
nuclear reactors (totaling more than 12,300 megawatts of
capacity) has been suspended pending safety inspections, after manipulation of inspection data that began in
the mid-1980s was uncovered [7]. This is expected to be a
temporary aberration, and nuclear generation is expected to regain its share of the Japanese electricity market in
the near future.
The lack of oil resources in Eastern Europe, in contrast to
the abundance of coal, has limited the share of oil in the
energy mix to an estimated 26 percent in 2001. Oil
demand in Eastern Europemainly for use in the transportation sectoris projected to grow by 2.5 percent per
year, to 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, rising to
about 29 percent of total energy consumption.
Poland, the largest economy in Eastern Europe and a
candidate for membership in the European Union in
2004, received the greatest amount of regional investment in the 1990s. Its economy has slowed over the past
2 years, however, leading to high unemployment, rising
interest rates, and falling demand for oil. Still, however,
Poland arguably offers the greatest potential for future
growth in oil demand in the Eastern Bloc in terms of
potential market size. The person per car ratio is 4.2 in
Poland, which is much higher than in many other countries in Europe (for example, Germany at about 1.7 and
the Czech Republic at about 2.8 persons per car) [8]. The
high ratio in Poland indicates room for expansion in the
automotive market and related demand for transportation fuels.
Strong economic growth has continued for the past
5 years in hydrocarbon-oriented economies such as
Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan,
supported by high earnings from oil and gas exports and
continued foreign investment. In the IEO2003 reference
case, GDP growth in the FSU countries is projected to
average 3.8 percent per year from 2001 to 2025, and oil
demand is expected to grow by 2 percent per year, from
3.9 million barrels per day in 2001 to 6.2 million barrels
per day in 2025.
The transportation sector, particularly trucking, is
expected to be the major source of oil demand growth in
the FSU region. Also, given the huge geographical
expanse of Russia, the largest economy in the region, a
continued increase in demand for air travel, and as a
result demand for jet fuel, can be expected to continue
with rising personal incomes. Apart from the transportation sector, oil demand in the FSU continues to decline
in the power generation and industrial sectors, mainly
because of improvements in efficiency and substitution
of natural gas for fuel oil.
Developing World
In the IEO2003 reference case, oil demand in the developing world is projected to reach 50.7 million barrels per
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
day by 2025. In developing Asia, Indias growth in oil
demand has slowed substantially in recent years, and
the high growth rate of the 1990s is not expected to be
sustained over the next two decades, as India moves further toward less oil-intensive economic activities, such
as services and information technology.
Developing Asia has managed to avoid the global slump
of 2001 through robust regional economic growth,
strong consumer confidence, low interest rates, and progressive liberalization of trade. Demand for road transportation fuels, in particular, is surging ahead to
pre-Asia crisis levels of 1998. This trend is projected to
continue, led by China and India, the two largest economies in the region. Oil demand in developing Asia is
projected to reach 29.8 million barrels per day in 2025.
China
Oil demand has continued to climb in China with
increasing motorization and switching away from coal
and traditional, noncommercial fuels in the residential
and service sectors. Oil demand in China is projected to
grow by 3.3 percent per year on average, from 5 million
barrels per day in 2001 to 10.9 million barrels per day in
2025. Most of the additional oil will have to be imported.
In 2001, vehicle ownership in China was 13 vehicles per
1,000 persons, as compared with 779 per 1,000 in the
United States. Chinas accession to the World Trade
Organization in 2001 is expected to increase competition
in the automobile sector, stimulating passenger car sales
and demand for transportation fuels. Car prices are
expected to fall by around 15 percent as a result of increased competition from imports. Chinas road system
is still failing to keep up with growth in vehicle use,
however, and its major cities already face gridlock. In
addition to poor road infrastructure, China has a lack of
parking facilities. The government carried out massive
infrastructure development in 2002, involving 251
highway projects covering 16,104 miles, at a cost of $ 4.1
billion [9]. The government plans for all counties in
undeveloped western China to have access to a highway
by the end of the year.
in China and parts of Southeast Asia and were sustained
throughout the financial shocks that hit Southeast Asia
in 1997 [11]. Indias GDP growth is projected to average
5.2 percent per year from 2001 to 2025, and oil demand is
projected to grow by 4 percent per year, from 2.1 million
barrels per day in 2001 to 5.5 million barrels per day in
2025. About 70 percent of the increase in oil demand is
projected for the transportation sector. The Indian government plans to spend $12.5 billion upgrading existing
roads and constructing two East-West and North-South
highways that will span the country by the end of 2003
[12]. Indias roads sector is believed to be among the fastest growing infrastructure areas in the country. On the
other hand, the impact of high oil prices in 2000 and
2001, the drought that weakened oil demand in the agricultural sector, the massive earthquake that struck the
prosperous state of Gujarat in January 2001, and the devastating monsoon (the first in a decade) in 2002 have
made sustaining the high oil demand growth registered
during the 1990s difficult to achieve over the past 2
years.
Diesel fuel has historically been much cheaper than gasoline in India. A substantial rise in gasoline prices in
1976 led to the conversion of almost all commercial vehicles to diesel engines. The continuous increase in gasoline prices and the subsidy provided to diesel
progressively increased demand for diesel commercial
vehicles; however, a recent drive against diesel and
greater use of compressed natural gas (CNG) seems to
be having some impact. The Delhi Transport Department was ordered by a Supreme Court directive to convert from diesel fuel to CNG by April 2001, in an attempt
to reduce pollution from diesel-fueled buses. The decision caused public transport chaos and angry demonstrations in New Delhi. The Supreme Court extended
the deadline for the diesel ban several times, but in April
2002 it stood firm, forcing the Delhi government to pull
around 6,000 diesel buses off the roads or face hefty
fines, and causing commuter chaos in the city. Indias
two major bus manufacturers benefitted from the decision, which forced the local government to purchase
around 1,000 new CNG-fueled buses [13]. Other cities
are following suit.
With strong growth in automobile use throughout the
country, the Chinese government has also become
increasingly concerned about air quality, particularly in
urban areas. In preparation for the Beijing Olympics in
2008, the Chinese government is planning to phase out
leaded gasoline and has pledged to replace 1.8 million
outdated vehicles [10].
Indias demand for oil in the form of naphtha for electric
power generation has grown at a phenomenal rate over
the past decade [14]. In the long run, however, demand
for naphtha in the power generation and industrial sectors is projected to decline, with natural gas claiming a
larger share of the energy mix.
India
South Korea
Indias GDP growth rates of 5 to 7 percent, sustained
over several years, have been better than anywhere in
the world except China. They have been achieved without the massive social dislocation that threatens stability
South Korea consumed 2.1 million barrels of oil per day
in 2001, compared with 1 million barrels per day in 1990.
It is likely that the country will experience continued
growth in oil demand, but at a slower rate than in the
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
1990s, as its transportation sector grows more slowly,
pressures for greater energy efficiency increase, and the
economy moves away from reliance on heavy industrial
production.
Nevertheless, Iran is in the process of commissioning the
Bushehr nuclear reactor, which was started in the 1970s,
with the assistance of Russian expertise [17]. The reactor
is expected to be completed by the end of 2004.
Oil demand in South Korea fell drastically in 2001 as the
result of an economic downturn. In 2002, economic
recovery was apparent in the country, and oil demand
was expected to begin rising as a result of stronger GDP
and, to some extent, the surge in tourism that accompanied the World Cup soccer games in Seoul [15]. Oil
demand in South Korea is projected to grow by 1.8 percent per year in the IEO2003 reference case, reaching 3.3
million barrels per day in 2025. The transportation sector
is expected to account for most of the increase, as
demand growth slows in the industrial sector and
remains flat in the residential and commercial sectors,
where consumers are expected to continue switching to
natural gas.
Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two largest oil consumers in
the Middle East, each surpassed the million barrel per
day consumption mark in the 1990s. Irans domestic
consumption of oil totaled at 1.5 million barrels per day
in 2002, representing more than one-third of its oil production capacity [18]. The growth in demand for oil in
Iran is supported by a large working-age population
and heavily subsidized prices for transportation fuels.
South Korea wants to use more CNG and less diesel fuel
in its transportation sector. The government has
announced a plan that would replace 20,000 diesel charter buses, 7,800 cross-country buses, and 2,200 express
buses with CNG vehicles. About 10 percent of South
Koreas metropolitan buses have already converted to
CNG [16]. The Korean Ministry of Environment has not
announced a decision on any clean-diesel option, which
would include the ultra-low-sulfur diesel used during
the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002.
Other Developing Asia
Oil demand in other developing Asia is projected to
grow by 2.6 percent per year, from 5.5 million barrels per
day in 2001 to 10.2 million barrels per day in 2025. Many
poor countries in the region still depend heavily on biomass energy. The need to switch from biomass to petroleum products as the regions national economies grow
will ensure that petroleum product consumption will
grow substantially during the forecast period. In addition, market liberalization measures, such as the lowering of import tariffs within the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area (AFTA) are
providing a further boost to the competitive economic
environment and oil demand growth.
Middle East
Oil demand in the Middle East is projected to grow at an
average annual rate of 2.1 percent, from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2001 to 8.9 million barrels per day in 2025.
Growth in the regions oil consumption is expected to be
tempered by aggressive moves into natural gas development and utilization being made by a number of countries. Oils share in the energy mix was about 53 percent
in 2001 and is projected to remain near that level through
2025. Coal, nuclear, and hydropower supplies in the
region are limited, and the prospects for their development are minimal given the availability of oil and gas.
In Saudi Arabia, the transportation sector and the massive petrochemical sector have been driving rapid
growth in oil demandmainly in the form of gasoline,
diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and naphtha
since the mid-1990s. Direct burning of crude oil in the
power generation sector still takes place in Saudi Arabia,
although the government plans to eliminate the practice
before 2015. That will require Saudi Arabia to use 2.6 billion cubic feet per day of additional natural gas [19]. The
Saudi government has launched a Strategic Gas Initiative, in which major oil companies (ExxonMobil and
Shell) have been invited to explore and develop gas
reserves that will feed five power plants and three desalination units, as well as petrochemical plants (see box
on page 66 in the Natural Gas chapter).
Turkey, the largest economy in the Middle East, is struggling in the aftermath of its economic crisis, which began
in February 2001 and left interest rates soaring. Over the
forecast period, Turkeys economy is projected to grow
by 4 percent per year, and its demand for oil is projected
to grow by 3.1 percent per year, from 0.6 million barrels
per day in 2001 to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2025.
Africa
In the past decade many African countries have introduced economic reforms under pressure from multilateral lending institutions [20]. Those reforms have started
to show positive effects in the economy of the region,
which in turn will encourage further growth in oil
demand, particularly in the transportation sector. Oil
demand in the power generation, industrial, and residential sectors is likely to remain relatively low due to
the availability of alternatives to oil. South Africa, the
largest economy in the region, is highly dependent on
coal and will soon expand its use of gas with the startup
of imports from Mozambique. During the outlook
period, oil demand in Africa as a whole is projected to
grow by 1.2 percent per year, to 3.5 million barrels per
day in 2025.
Central and South America
IEO2003 projects stronger growth for oil demand in
the developing world than in the industrial world but
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
weaker growth than was projected in IEO2002 projection. In particular, expectations for growth in Central
and South America have been substantially lowered
because of financial setbacks in Argentina and political
unrest in Venezuela.
Middle East region registered no decline in drilling
activity during 1998. In general, onshore drilling fell
more sharply than offshore drilling. Worldwide, offshore rig utilization rates were generally sustained at
levels better than 80 percent of capacity [22].
The lack of domestic savings, with the exception of
Chile, is a significant limiting factor for potential economic growth in Central and South America. Many
countries are in danger of serious economic turmoil in
the face of their crippling debt-servicing requirements.
In 2002, oil demand was hardest hit in Argentina, which
plunged into depression after the countrys economic
collapse in December 2001. Fuel prices in Argentina
have nearly doubled in 2002 after the devaluation of the
local peso currency, causing sharp contraction of oil
demand [21]. Colombia, Venezuela, and Uruguay all
have tipped into recession, and investors have shied
away from Brazil, the regions largest economy, fearing
that the new, left-leaning government might reverse
past privatization efforts.
The reference case projects that about 61 percent of the
increase in petroleum demand over the next two
decades will be met by an increase in production by
members of OPEC rather than by non-OPEC suppliers.
OPEC production in 2025 is projected to be more than
25 million barrels per day higher than it was in 2001
(Figure 37). The IEO2003 estimates of OPEC production
capacity to 2005 are slightly less than those projected in
IEO2002, reflecting a shift toward non-OPEC supply
projects in the recent high price environment. Some analysts suggest that OPEC might pursue significant price
escalation through conservative capacity expansion
decisions rather than undertake ambitious production
expansion programs; however, the low and high world
oil price forecasts in this outlook do not assume such
suggestions.
The share of oil in total primary energy demand declined in Central and South America over the past
decades with the development of large hydropower
projects. Oil still accounts for one-half of the regions
total energy use, however, and few new large-scale
hydropower opportunities are expected to be developed
over the forecast period. IEO2003 projects that oils share
will decline slowly to 45 percent in 2025, mainly due to
competition from natural gas in the electricity generation and industrial sectors. Oil demand in Central and
South America is projected to grow by 2.1 percent per
year, to 8.5 million barrels per day in 2025.
The Composition of World Oil
Supply
In the IEO2003 reference case, world oil supply in 2025 is
projected to exceed the 2001 level by 41 million barrels
per day. Increases in production are expected for both
OPEC and non-OPEC producers; however, only about
39 percent of the total increase is expected to come from
non-OPEC areas. Over the past two decades, the growth
in non-OPEC oil supply has resulted in an OPEC market
share substantially under its historic high of 52 percent
in 1973. New exploration and production technologies,
aggressive cost-reduction programs by industry, and
attractive fiscal terms to producers by governments all
contribute to the outlook for continued growth in
non-OPEC oil production.
While the long-term outlook for non-OPEC supply
remains optimistic, the low oil price environment of
1998 and early 1999 had a definite impact on exploration
and development activity. By the end of 1998, drilling
activity in North America had fallen by more than 25
percent from its level a year earlier. Worldwide, only the
Reserves and Resources

information in Table 11 is derived from the USGS mean
estimate, an average assessment over a wide range of
uncertainty for reserve growth and undiscovered
resources. The IEO2003 oil production forecast is based
on the USGS mean assessment.
Expansion of OPEC Production Capacity
It is generally acknowledged that OPEC members with
large proved reserves and relatively low costs for expansion of production capacity can accommodate sizable
increases in petroleum demand. In the IEO2003 reference case, the production call on OPEC suppliers is
projected to grow at a robust annual rate of 2.5 percent
through 2025 (Table 12 and Figure 38). OPEC capacity
utilization is expected to increase sharply after 2001,
reaching 95 percent by 2015 and remaining there
through 2025.
Amidst enormous uncertainty, Iraqs role in OPEC in
the next several years will be of particular interest. In the
IEO2003 reference case, Iraq is assumed to maintain its

current oil production capacity of 3.1 million barrels per
day into 2003. Iraq has indicated a desire to expand its
production capacity aggressively, to about 6 million barrels per day, once the sanctions are lifted. Preliminary
discussions of exploration projects have already been
held with potential outside investors. Such a large
increase in Iraqi oil exports would offset a significant
portion of the price stimulus associated with the
expected growth in oil demand.
Given the requirements for OPEC production capacity
expansion implied by the IEO2003 estimates, much
attention has been focused on the oil development,

production, and operating costs of individual OPEC
producers. With Persian Gulf producers enjoying a
reserve-to-production ratio that exceeds 89 years, substantial capacity expansion clearly is feasible.
Production costs in Persian Gulf OPEC nations are less
than $2 per barrel, and the capital investment required
to increase production capacity by 1 barrel per day is less
than $5,600 [23]. Assuming the IEO2003 low price trajectory, total development and operating costs over the
entire projection period, expressed as a percentage of
gross oil revenues, would be less than 21 percent. Thus,
Persian Gulf OPEC producers can expand capacity at a
cost that is a relatively small percentage of projected
gross revenues.
For OPEC producers outside the Persian Gulf, the cost to
expand production capacity by 1 barrel per day is considerably greater, exceeding $12,700 in some member
nations; yet those producers can expect margins in
excess of 34 percent on investments to expand production capacity over the long term, even in the low price
case [24]. Venezuela has the greatest potential for capacity expansion and could aggressively increase its production capacity by more than 1.0 million barrels per
day, to 4.2 million barrels per day by 2005. It is unclear,
however, whether the current political climate in Venezuela will support the outside investment required for
any substantial expansion of production capacity.
Tables D1-D6 in Appendix D show the ranges of production potential for both OPEC and non-OPEC producers.
The reference case projection implies aggressive efforts
by OPEC member nations to apply or attract investment
capital to implement a wide range of production capacity expansion projects. If those projects were not undertaken, world oil prices could escalate; however, the
combination of potential profitability and the threat of
competition from non-OPEC suppliers argue for the
pursuit of a relatively aggressive expansion strategy.
In the IEO2003 forecast, OPEC members outside the
Persian Gulf are expected to increase their production
potential substantially, despite their higher capacity
expansion costs. There is much optimism regarding
Nigerias offshore production potential, although it is
unlikely to be developed until the middle to late part of
this decade. In addition, increased optimism about the
production potential of Algeria, Libya, and Venezuela
supports the possibility that the growth in world
dependence on Persian Gulf oil will slow.
Non-OPEC Supply
The growth in non-OPEC oil supplies played a significant role in the erosion of OPECs market share over the
past two decades, as non-OPEC supply became increasingly diverse. North America dominated non-OPEC
supply in the early 1970s, the North Sea and Mexico
evolved as major producers in the 1980s, and much of
the new production in the 1990s has come from the
developing countries of Latin America, West Africa, the
non-OPEC Middle East, and China. In the IEO2003 reference case, non-OPEC supply from proved reserves is
expected to increase steadily, from 46.7 million barrels
per day in 2001 to 62.8 million barrels per day in 2025
(Table 13).
There are several important differences between the
IEO2003 production profiles and those published in
IEO2002:
The U.S. production decline is somewhat less severe
in the IEO2003 projections as a result of higher oil
price paths, technological advances yielding higher
recovery rates, and lower costs for deepwater exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico.
The expected decline in North Sea production is
slightly tempered, due to higher oil price paths
coupled with enhanced subsea and recovery
technologies.
Resource development in the Caspian Basin region
was expected to be delayed significantly in the
IEO2002 forecast due to significant geopolitical challenges and an expected lower price environment. In
the IEO2003 projections, Caspian output is expected
to rise to almost 2.5 million barrels per day by 2005
and to increase steadily thereafter. There still
remains a great deal of uncertainty about export
routes from the Caspian Basin region.
IEO2002 anticipated moderate delays in the exploration and development of deepwater projects worldwide. Significant output from such projects was not
anticipated until oil prices returned to and remained

in the range of $22 to $28 per barrel for a significant
period of time. With higher world oil price assumptions, output from deepwater projects in the U.S.
Texas Gulf, the North Sea, West Africa, the South
China Sea, Brazil, Colombia, and the Caspian Basin is
accelerated in the IEO2003 forecast by 2 to 3 years.
In the IEO2003 forecast, the decline in North Sea production is slowed as a result of substantial improvement in
field recovery rates. Production from Norway, Western
Europes largest producer, is expected to peak at about
3.4 million barrels per day in 2004 and then gradually
decline to about 2.5 million barrels per day by the end of
the forecast period with the maturing of some of its
larger and older fields. The United Kingdom sector is
expected to produce about 2.5 million barrels per day by
the middle of this decade, followed by a decline to 1.4
million barrels per day by 2025.
Two non-OPEC Persian Gulf producers are expected to
increase output gradually over the first half of this
decade. Enhanced recovery techniques are expected to
increase output in Oman by more than 160,000 barrels
per day, with only a gradual production decline anticipated after 2005. Current oil production in Yemen is expected to increase by at least 90,000 barrels per day in the
next several years, and those levels should show little
decline throughout the forecast period. Syria is expected
to hold its production flat throughout this decade, but
little in the way of new resource potential will allow anything except declining production volumes.
Oil producers in the Pacific Rim are expected to increase
their production volumes significantly as a result of
enhanced exploration and extraction technologies. India
is expected to show some modest production increase
early in this decade and only a modest decline in output
thereafter. Deepwater fields offshore from the Philippines have resulted in an improved reserve picture;
by the middle of this decade, their production is expected to reach almost 55,000 barrels per day. Vietnam is still
viewed with considerable optimism regarding longterm production potential, although exploration activity
has been slower than originally hoped. Output levels
from Vietnamese fields are expected to exceed 415,000
barrels per day by 2025.
Australia has made significant recent additions to its
proved reserves, and it is possible that Australia will
become a one million barrel per day producer by the
middle of this decade. Malaysia shows little potential for
any significant new finds, and its output is expected to
peak at around 800,000 barrels per day early in this
decade and then gradually decline to 680,000 barrels per
day by 2025. Papua New Guinea continues to add to its
reserve posture and is expected to achieve production
volumes approaching 150,000 barrels per day by the
middle of this decade, followed by only a modest
decline over the remainder of the forecast period.
Exploration and test-well activity have pointed to some
production potential for Bangladesh and Myanmar, but
significant output is not expected until late in this
decade.
Oil producers in Central and South America have significant potential for increasing output over the next
decade. Brazil became a million barrel per day producer
in 1999, with considerable production potential waiting
to be tapped. Brazils production is expected to rise
throughout the forecast period and to top 3.9 million
barrels per day by 2025. Colombias current economic
downturn and civil unrest have delayed development of
its upstream sector, but its output is expected to top
650,000 barrels per day within the decade and then show
a modest decline for the remainder of the forecast
period. In both countries, the oil sector would benefit
significantly from the creation of a favorable climate for
foreign investment.
Argentina is expected to increase its production volumes by at least 150,000 barrels per day over the next 2
years, and by the middle of the decade it is capable of
becoming a million barrel per day producer. Although
the current political situation in Ecuador is in transition,
there is still optimism that Ecuador will increase production by more than 350,000 barrels per day within the next
few years.
Several West African producers (Angola, Cameroon,
Chad, Congo, Gabon, and Ivory Coast) are expected to
reap the benefits of substantial exploration activity,
especially considering the recent rebound in oil prices.
Angola is expected to become a million barrel per day
producer early in this decade. Given the excellent exploration results, Angola could produce volumes of up to
3.2 million barrels per day well into the later years of the
forecast period. The other West African producers with
offshore tracts are expected to increase output by up to
1 million barrels per day for the duration of the forecast.
North African producers Egypt and Tunisia produce
mainly from mature fields and show little promise of
adding to their reserve posture. As a result, their production volumes are expected to decline gradually
throughout the forecast. Sudan and Equatorial Guinea
are expected to produce significant volumes by the middle of this decade. Both could approach 500,000 barrels
per day. Eritrea, Mauritania, Somalia, and South Africa
also have some resource potential, but they are not
expected to produce significant amounts until after
2005.
In North America, moderately rising U.S. output is
expected to be complemented by significant production
increases in Canada and Mexico. Canadas conventional
oil output is expected to increase by more than 200,000
barrels per day over the next 2 years, mainly from
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Newfoundlands Hibernia oil project, which could produce more than 155,000 barrels per day at its peak sometime in the next several years. Canada is projected to add
an additional 500,000 barrels per day in output from a
combination of frontier area offshore projects and oil
from tar sands (see box below). Higher expected oil
prices, technological advances, and lower costs for deepwater exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico
enhance the long-term U.S. production profile. Mexico is
expected to adopt energy policies that will encourage
the efficient development of its resource base. Expected
production volumes in Mexico exceed 4.2 million barrels
per day by the end of the decade and remain near that
level through 2025.
With assumed higher oil prices, oil production in the
FSU is expected to exceed 10 million barrels per day by
2005. The long-term production potential for the FSU is
And the Country with the Second Greatest Proved Oil Reserves Worldwide Is . . .
Six months ago, Iraq was the correct completion of
the above phrase. Its 112.5 billion barrels of proved oil
reserves was second only to Saudi Arabias imposing
259.3 billion barrels. However, in the December 23,
2002, issue of the Oil & Gas Journal, proved oil reserves
in Canada catapulted from an estimated 4.9 billion barrels in 2002 to an amazing 180 billion barrels in 2003.
How was this possible? A methodology change by the
Oil & Gas Journal now includes western Canadas oil
sands in its definition of proved oil reserves. Heretofore, oil sands were considered nonconventional and
were not counted as proved oil reserves; however, dramatic reductions in development and production costs
have brought oil sands into the realm of economic viability. With todays technologies and oil prices, it is
entirely appropriate to consider western Canadas vast
oil potential as being commensurate with conventional crude oils.a
How much is there? It is estimated that there are about
1.7 trillion barrels of oil in the oil sands of Canada, and
that about 15 percent (255 billion barrels) of the total oil
in place is recoverable. Canada accounts for about 75
percent of the worlds oil sand resources. Other countries and regions that have significant, but more modest, resources include the United States, China, the
EE/FSU, the Caribbean Basin, and Pakistan. About 700
thousand barrels per day of Canadian oil sands are currently being produced. This supply is divided into two
categories, oil sands in situ (often referred to as bitumen) and oil sands mining. These two categories
reflect the method of recovery. The bitumen is
extracted by injecting very hot steam into the rock formation to heat up the oil, lower its viscosity, and allow
it to flow more like conventional oil. Slightly more than
half (about 400 thousand barrels per day) of Canadian
oil sands production is derived from the more expensive oil sands mining method. Those deposits that
are close enough to the surface are actually mined.
How much does recovery from oil sands cost? Supply
costs are expressed as full cycle costs. They include
all costs associated with exploration, development, and
production; capital costs; operating costs; taxes and
royalties; and a 10-percent real rate of return to the producer. Capital costs average $5 to $9 per barrel, and
operating costs average $8 to $12 per barrel. Such costs
are presented as a range, reflecting the variance in reservoir quality, depth, project size, and operating
parameters. The remainder of the supply cost is dominated by the cleaning and upgrading methods that are
required to turn a very low quality hydrocarbon into a
more conventional oil that can be accepted by a refinery. Such methods include the removal of sulfur, heavy
metals, and noncombustible materials, as well as conversion to a more hydrogenated and lighter hydrocarbon. These costs are typically in the $3 to $5 per barrel
range. None of the aforementioned costs include transportation to market. This past summer, Suncor Energy
opened the upgrading units of its Millennium Project
in Alberta with production costs around $9 per barrel.
The companys near-term goal is to lower production
costs to $5.50 per barrel, which would make Suncor the
lowest-cost oil producer in North America.b
What is the long-term outlook for production from oil
sands? IEO2003 projects that Canadian oil sand production in the reference case will increase to more than
2.2 million barrels per day by 2025. The projection
assumes that world oil prices will moderate in the next
few years and gradually increase to over $26.50 per
barrel (all prices expressed in 2001 dollars) by the end
of the forecast period. The IEO2003 high oil price case
(over $33 per barrel by 2025) shows Canadian oil sand
production increasing to almost 2.5 million barrels per
day by 2025. The only thing that prevents Canadian oil
sands production from being considerably higher
(both now and in the future) is the lack of transportation infrastructure (most likely pipeline capacity) for
moving production to market. The United States is
expected to import almost 1 million barrels per day of
production from Canadian oil sands by 2025. If potential pipeline projects from Western Canada into
PADDs II and IV materialize over the next two
decades, the share of Canadian oil sand production
going to U.S. imports could grow substantially.

still regarded with considerable optimism, especially for
the resource-rich Caspian Basin region. The IEO2003 reference case shows FSU output exceeding 15.9 million
barrels per day by 2025, implying export volumes exceeding 6.7 million barrels per day. In China, oil production is expected to decline slightly to about 3.4 million
barrels per day by 2025. Chinas import requirements
are expected to be as large as its domestic production
by 2012 and to continue growing as its petroleum consumption increases.
The IEO2003 estimates for non-OPEC production potential are based on such parameters as numbers of exploration wells, finding rates, reserve-to-production ratios,
advances in both exploration and extraction technologies, and sensitivity to changes in the world oil price. A
critical component of the forecasting methodology is the
constraint placed on the exploration and development
of non-OPEC undiscovered resources. For the purpose
of the three IEO2003 price cases, no more than 15, 25, and
35 percent of the mean USGS estimate of non-OPEC
undiscovered oil is assumed to be developed over the
forecast period in the low price, reference, and high
price cases, respectively. In all the oil price cases, OPEC
producers are assumed to be the source of the required
residual supply. Tables D1-D6 in Appendix D show the
ranges of production potential for both OPEC and
non-OPEC producers.
The expectation in the late 1980s and early 1990s was
that non-OPEC production in the longer term would
stagnate or decline gradually in response to resource
constraints. The relatively insignificant cost of developing oil resources in OPEC countries (especially those
in the Persian Gulf region) was considered such an
overwhelming advantage that non-OPEC production
potential was viewed with considerable pessimism.
In actuality, however, despite a relatively low price environment, non-OPEC production has risen every year
since 1993, adding more than 5.8 million barrels per day
between 1993 and 2001.
It is expected that non-OPEC producers will continue to
increase output, producing an additional 6.6 million barrels per day by 2010. Three factors are generally given
credit for the impressive resiliency of non-OPEC production: development of new exploration and production technologies, efforts by the oil industry to reduce
costs, and efforts by producer governments to promote
exploration and development by encouraging outside
investors with attractive fiscal terms.
Worldwide Petroleum Trade in the
Reference Case
In 2001, industrialized countries imported 16.1 million
barrels of oil per day from OPEC producers. Of that
total, 9.7 million barrels per day came from the Persian
Gulf region. Oil movements to industrialized countries
represented almost 65 percent of the total petroleum
exported by OPEC member nations and almost 58 percent of all Persian Gulf exports (Table 14). By the end of
the forecast period, OPEC exports to industrialized
countries are estimated to be about 11 million barrels per
day higher than their 2001 level, and more than half the
increase is expected to come from the Persian Gulf
region.
Despite such a substantial increase, the share of total
petroleum exports that goes to the industrialized
nations in 2025 is projected to be almost 5 percent below
their 2001 share, and the share of Persian Gulf exports
going to the industrialized nations is projected to fall to
about 12 percent. The significant shift expected in the
balance of OPEC export shares between the industrialized and developing nations is a direct result of the economic growth anticipated for the developing nations of
the world, especially those of Asia. OPEC petroleum
exports to developing countries are expected to increase
by more than 16.8 million barrels per day over the forecast period, with three-fourths of the increase going to
the developing countries of Asia. China, alone, is likely
to import about 5.9 million barrels per day from OPEC
by 2025, virtually all of which is expected to come from
Persian Gulf producers.
North Americas petroleum imports from the Persian
Gulf are expected to almost double over the forecast
period (Figure 39). At the same time, more than one-half
of total North American imports in 2025 are expected to
be from Atlantic Basin producers and refiners, with significant increases expected in crude oil imports from
Latin American producers, including Venezuela, Brazil,

Colombia, and Mexico. West African producers, including Nigeria and Angola, are also expected to increase
their export volumes to North America. Caribbean Basin
refiners are expected to account for most of the increase
in North American imports of refined products.
With a moderate decline in North Sea production,
Western Europe is expected to import increasing
amounts from Persian Gulf producers and from OPEC
member nations in both northern and western Africa.
Substantial imports from the Caspian Basin are also
expected. Industrialized Asian nations are expected to
increase their already heavy dependence on Persian
Gulf oil. The developing countries of the Pacific Rim are
expected to almost double their total petroleum imports
between 2001 and 2025.
Worldwide crude oil distillation refining capacity was
about 81.2 million barrels per day at the beginning of
2002. To meet the projected growth in international oil
demand in the reference case, worldwide refining capacity would have to increase by more than 40 million barrels per day by 2025. Substantial growth in distillation
capacity is expected in the Middle East, Central and
South America, and especially in the Asia Pacific region.
Refiners in North America and Europe, while making
only modest additions to their distillation capacity, are
expected to continue improving product quality and
enhancing the usefulness of the heavier portion of the
barrel through investment in downstream capacity.
Likewise, future investments by developing countries
are also expected to include more advanced configurations designed to meet the anticipated increase in
demand for lighter products, especially transportation
fuels.

Other Views of Prices and
Production
Several oil market analysis groups produce world oil
price and production forecasts. Table 15 compares the
IEO2003 world oil price projections with similar forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
Petroleum Economics, Ltd. (PEL), Petroleum Industry
Research Associates (PIRA), Altos Partners (Altos),
Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. (EEA),
Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), Global Insight,
Inc. (GII), and Deutsche Banc Alex.Brown (DBAB).
The collection of forecasts includes a wide range of price
projections, based on the volatility of the world oil markets. In particular, oil prices have fluctuated widely
since the late 1990s, first tumbling as a result of the Asian
economic recession of 1997-1998, then climbing with the
regions subsequent recovery. High oil prices followed
the ability of OPEC to maintain production quotas in
2000, which supported sustained high prices throughout the year. Finally, oil prices collapsed in mid- to late
2001 as a result of decreases in demand that accompanied the global economic slowdown and the aftermath
of the September 11 terrorist attacks but recovered during 2002 as a result of unrest in the Middle East, disruption of Venezuelas oil exports, a colder than expected
winter in North America, and low storage levels in the
United States. By the first quarter of 2003, oil prices had
neared $40 per barrel (nominal dollars).
The current oil price projections for 2005 range from
PELs $21.21 per barrel (constant 2001 U.S. dollars) to
IEO2003s $23.27 per barrel. The NRCan forecast is the
earliest: NRCans projection was originally formulated
in 1997 (but reaffirmed in 2002). Nevertheless, NRCans
forecast falls well within the range defined by the other
forecasts. Five of the eight forecastsGII, IEA, PEL,
DBAB, and EEAfall below the range defined by the
IEO2003 high and low world oil price cases in 2005,
demonstrating the volatility of the oil markets in the
wide range of price projections in this early year of the
forecast.
The PEL price forecast series may be considered an outlier relative to the rest of the forecasts. It is the only series
among the set of forecasts that is based on Brent oil
prices; they fall consistently below those of the IEO2003
low price path through 2015, when the PEL time series
ends. If the PEL series is omitted, the range of prices
among the remaining series is much smaller in 2015, $7
per barrel, with PIRA at the high end of the range ($26.32
per barrel) and DBAB at the low end ($19.34 per barrel).
At the end of the forecast period, the uncertainty among
the forecasters as measured by the difference between
highest and lowest expected prices climbs to $12.43 per
barrel, with the range defined by the Altos ($31.61 per
barrel) and DBAB ($19.18 per barrel) forecasts.
The IEO2003 price projections are generally at the high
end of the spectrum of price forecasts across the

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
2005-2025 time period, with a few exceptions. PIRAs
$26.32 price forecast for 2015 is higher than the IEO2003
estimate of $24.72. The Altos forecasts for 2015-2025 are
higher than the IEO2003 reference case projections, as
are the IEA price estimates for 2020 and 2025. It should
be noted that IEA did not publish a price projection for
2015 or 2025 in its World Energy Outlook 2002; however, it
states that prices are assumed to rise in a linear fashion
after 2010, from $21.47 per barrel in 2010 to $29.65 per
barrel in 2030. A simple interpolation results in oil prices
in 2015 of about $23.52 per barrel and in 2025 of $27.61
per barrel, placing the IEA prices slightly below the
IEO2003 estimate of $24.72 per barrel in 2015 but above
the IEO2003 estimate in 2025.
The Altos price projections follow a particularly steep
upward path over the 2005 to 2025 time horizon.
Whereas the Altos prices in 2005 are $0.63 per barrel
lower than those in the IEO2003 reference case, by 2015
they are $0.86 per barrel higher than the IEO2003 prices.
By 2025, the Altos prices are $5.04 per barrel higher than
the IEO2003 projection.
The price forecasts are influenced by differing views of
the projected composition of world oil production. Two
factors are of particular importance: (1) expansion of
OPEC oil production and (2) the timing of a recovery in
EE/FSU oil production. All the forecasts agree that the
recovery of EE/FSU production will be fairly slow, although most are somewhat more optimistic about EE/
FSU production development than they were last year.
High world oil prices in 2002 and into the first part of
2003, along with accelerating economic recovery in Russia, currently the largest oil producer in the EE/FSU
region, no doubt have influenced the production forecasts for the EE/FSU. Nevertheless, only DBAB projects
that the share of EE/FSU production will rise above 15
percent over the course of the projection period. DBAB
estimates that EE/FSU production will rise to 18 percent
of total world oil supply by 2025 (Table 16). GII is the
least optimistic about recovery in the region, and its projected share for the EE/FSU remains at 11 percent
throughout the 2005-2025 time period. The other four
production forecasts expect the EE/FSU share of world
oil production to vary between 13 and 15 percent.
IEO2003 projects that the EE/FSU share of production
will reach 14 percent of the world total in 2015 and
remain at that level through 2025.
The forecasts that provide projections through 2020
(IEO2003, GII, DBAB, and IEA) all expect OPEC to provide incremental production of between 17 and 20 million barrels per day between 2001 and 2020 (Table 16).
There is more variation in expectations among these
four forecasts for the other non-OPEC suppliers. GII
expects a substantial increase of 13.1 million barrels per
day of supply from other suppliers, whereas IEA
expects a decline of 5.0 million barrels per day in production from other non-OPEC sources. IEA projects that
the other share of world oil production will fall to 31
percent by 2020 while the OPEC share increases to 48
percent. In contrast to GII, IEO2003 expects more moderate growth in other non-OPEC supply, at 8.0 million barrels per day from 2001 to 2020. DBAB expects growth of
3.5 million barrels per day.

Natural Gas
Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the IEO2003 forecast.
Consumption of natural gas is projected to nearly double between 2001 and 2025,
with the most robust growth in demand expected among the developing nations.
Natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing component of world primary energy consumption in the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference case.
Consumption of natural gas worldwide is projected to
increase by an average of 2.8 percent annually from 2001
to 2025, compared with projected annual growth rates of
1.8 percent for oil consumption and 1.5 percent for coal.
Natural gas consumption in 2025, at 176 trillion cubic
feet, is projected to be nearly double the 2001 total of 90
trillion cubic feet (Figure 40). The natural gas share of
total energy consumption is projected to increase from
23 percent in 2001 to 28 percent in 2025.
The most robust growth in natural gas demand is
expected among the nations of the developing world,
where overall demand in the reference case rises by 3.9
percent per year between 2001 and 2025. The level of natural gas use in the developing world by 2025 is projected
to be two and one-half times the 2001 level (Figure 41).
Much of the growth in the region is expected to fuel electricity generation, but infrastructure projects are also
underway for natural gas to displace polluting home
heating and cooking fuels in major urban areas, such as
Beijing and Shanghai.
Figure 40. World Natural Gas Consumption,
1970-2025
Projections
Rapid growth in natural gas use is projected for Mexico,
at 6.1 percent per year over the projection period. The
industrial and electric utility sectors are expected to
account for most of the growth, and some increase for
residential and commercial sector use are expected as a
result of the 1995 privatization of the transmission and
Figure 41. Natural Gas Consumption in the
Developing World, 1970-2025

History
Industrialized countries, where natural gas markets are
most mature, also are projected to increase their reliance
on natural gas. Over the next 24 years, demand for natural gas in the industrialized world is expected to increase
by 2.2 percent annually, almost twice the rate of increase
projected for oil. Among the industrialized regions,
North America is expected to have the largest increment
in natural gas use between 2001 and 2025, at 19 trillion
cubic feet (Figure 42). The United States alone accounts
for 66 percent of the total North American increment in
gas consumption. In the United States, natural gas
demand is expected to rise by 1.8 percent annually,
mainly for electricity generation. Of the new generating
capacity projected for the United States, 80 percent is
expected to be natural-gas-fired combined-cycle or combustion turbine technology, including distributed generation capacity.

distribution sector, which has brought natural gas service to a number of cities for the first time.
Western Europe is also expected to expand its use of natural gas strongly over the projection period, at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent. Liberalization of natural
gas markets in the European Union has been underway
since the passage of the Natural Gas Directive in 1998,
and in a majority of the member countries, natural gas
infrastructures are expected to be fully open to thirdparty access by 2008. Increases in natural gas use for
electricity generation are expected in many Western
European countries, replacing many old coal-fired generators and nuclear power plants set to retire in the coming decades. Total natural gas consumption in Western
Europe is expected to increase from 14.8 trillion cubic
feet in 2001 to 25.9 trillion cubic feet in 2025.
In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (EE/
FSU), natural gas consumption is expected to increase
by 2.9 percent annually between 2001 and 2025. The fastest rates of growth in the region are projected for the
countries of Eastern Europe, where economic recovery
has been underway since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and the economies of the region continue to align
with their wealthier Western European neighbors. Eastern Europes demand for natural gas is expected to grow
by 4.6 percent per year in the forecast. An infrastructure
that is fast becoming integrated with Western Europe
supports the growth in East European gas use. In the
Figure 42. Increases in Natural Gas Consumption
by Region, 2001-2025
Developing Asia
FSU, natural gas demand is expected to increase at a
somewhat slower pace, 2.6 percent per year. There has
been some progress in restructuring the natural gas markets in the FSU, and several years of positive economic
growth indicate that sustained economic recovery is
now underway.
The amount of natural gas traded across international
borders continues to grow, increasing from barely 19
percent of the worlds consumption in 1995 to 23 percent
in 2001 [1]. Pipeline exports grew by 39 percent and liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade grew by 55 percent
between 1995 and 2001. Numerous international pipelines are either planned or already under construction.
Projected increases in world natural gas consumption
will require bringing new gas resources to market.
The fact that many sources of natural gas are far from
demand centers, coupled with cost decreases throughout the LNG chain, has made LNG increasingly
competitive, contributing to the expectation of strong
worldwide growth for LNG.
The economics of transporting natural gas to demand
centers currently depend on the market price, and the
pricing of natural gas is not as straightforward as the
pricing of oil. More than 50 percent of the worlds oil
consumption is traded internationally, whereas natural
gas markets tend to be more regional in nature, and
prices can vary considerably from country to country. In
Asia and Europe, for example, LNG markets are
strongly influenced by oil product markets rather than
by natural gas prices. As the use and trade of natural gas
continue to grow, it is expected that pricing mechanisms
will continue to evolve, facilitating international trade
and paving the way for a global natural gas market.

Since the mid-1970s, world natural gas reserves have
generally trended upward each year (Figure 43). As of
January 1, 2003, proved world natural gas reserves,3 as
reported by Oil & Gas Journal, were estimated at 5,501
trillion cubic feet, 50 trillion cubic feet more than the estimate for 2002. Most of the increase is attributed to developing countries, where gas reserves have increased by
37 trillion cubic feet since last years survey. Natural gas
reserves in the industrialized countries also increased
between 2002 and 2003, by 18 trillion cubic feet. EE/FSU
reserves declined by 4 trillion cubic feetprimarily
because of lowered estimates for Turkmenistan, where
reserves declined by 30 trillion cubic feet. The decrement
was largely offset by the enormous upward revision to
Azerbaijan gas reserves in this years survey, from 4 trillion cubic feet in 2002 to 30 trillion cubic feet in 2003.
3 Proved Reserves, as reported by the Oil & Gas Journal, are estimated quantities that can be recovered under present technology and
prices. Figures reported for Canada and the former Soviet Union, however, include reserves in the probably category. Natural gas reserves
reported by the Oil & Gas Journal are compiled from voluntary survey responses and do not always reflect the most recent changes. Significant gas discoveries made during 2002 are not likely to be reflected in the reported reserves.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Most (about 71 percent) of the worlds natural gas
reserves are located in the Middle East and the EE/FSU
(Figure 44), with Russia and Iran together accounting for
about 45 percent of the worlds natural gas reserves
(Table 17). Reserves in the rest of the world are fairly
evenly distributed on a regional basis.
Despite high rates of increase in natural gas consumption, particularly over the past decade, most regional
reserves-to-production ratios have remained high.
Worldwide, the reserves-to-production ratio is estimated at 61.9 years [2]. Central and South America has a
reserves-to-production ratio of 71.6 years, the FSU 78.5
years, and Africa 90.2 years. The Middle Easts
reserves-to-production ratio exceeds 100 years.

The largest expansion in worldwide natural gas reserves
between 2002 and 2003 occurred in Western Europe,
where 31 trillion cubic feet was added to the regions
reserve base. This increment in reserves is entirely attributable to Norway, where reserves grew by 33 trillion
cubic feet as a result of recent new gas finds, including
Statoils Tyrihans South discovery of oil and gas in the
Norwegian Sea [3]. The increment in Norwegian
reserves more than offset minor decrements in other
Western European countriesincluding the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germanyand placed
Norway among the top 20 countries with respect to
proven natural gas reserves.

Among the regions of the developing world, Africa and
Asia had the largest revisions in proved natural gas
reserves between 2002 and 2003. In Africa, the entire
increment of 23 trillion cubic feet in gas reserves is attributable to Egypt, where a marked increase in exploration
activity over the past few years has resulted in a substantial increase in gas reserves, including finds in the Western Desert, Gulf of Suez, Mediterranean Sea, and Nile
Delta [5]. Developing Asia saw an increase in reserves of
11 trillion cubic feet over the past year. Among the
developing Asian countries, the greatest increases in
proven reserves were in China and India, where
reserves grew by 5 trillion cubic feet and 4 trillion cubic
feet, respectively. Modest increases were made in Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) periodically assesses
the long-term production potential of worldwide petroleum resources (oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids).
According to the most recent USGS estimates, released
in the World Petroleum Assessment 2000, a significant volume of natural gas remains to be discovered. The mean
estimate for worldwide undiscovered gas is 4,839 trillion cubic feet (Figure 45), which is approximately double the worldwide cumulative consumption forecast in
IEO2003. A further 3,000 trillion cubic feet is estimated
to be in stranded reserves, usually located too far
away from pipeline infrastructure or population centers
to make transportation of the natural gas economical.
Of the new natural gas resources expected to be added
over the next 25 years, reserve growth accounts for 2,347
trillion cubic feet. More than one-half of the mean undiscovered gas estimate is expected to come from the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and North Africa,

Although the United States has produced more than 40
percent of its total estimated natural gas endowment
and carries less than 10 percent as remaining reserves, in
the rest of the world reserves have been largely unexploited. Outside the United States, the world has produced less than 10 percent of its total estimated natural
gas endowment and carries more than 30 percent as
remaining reserves.
Regional Activity
North America
Natural gas consumption in North America is projected
to grow by 2.2 percent per year on average between 2001
and 2025 (Figure 46). Demand for gas is projected to
increase in all three countries of the region (Canada,
Mexico, and the United States), with the highest rate of
growth projected for Mexico. The expanding gas infrastructure in Mexico is expected to be particularly
focused on providing gas to electric power stations. The
Canadian and U.S. natural gas markets are already well
integrated. As additional infrastructure is built in Mexico and between Mexico and the United States, it is
expected that an increasingly integrated natural gas
market will serve the entire region.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
U.S. natural gas consumption is projected to increase
from 22.6 trillion cubic feet in 2001 to 34.9 trillion cubic
feet in 2025. The largest increase in U.S. gas consumption
is expected to occur in the electricity generation sector,
which is projected to consume 10.6 trillion cubic feet in
2025 [6]. Both U.S. production and imports of natural gas
are expected to grow. In 2025, net Canadian gas imports
are expected to provide 15 percent of total U.S. consumption, which is about the same proportion being
supplied by Canada today. This projection of Canadian
gas exports to the United States expects that the MacKenzie Delta gas pipeline will begin operation in 2016.
An additional 6 percent of total U.S. natural gas consumption, or 2.1 trillion cubic feet, is projected to be supplied by LNG imports (Figure 47). Mexico is expected to
become a net exporter of natural gas to the United States
after 2019, assuming the construction of an LNG regasification terminal in Baja, Mexico.
In 2000 and 2001, new U.S. gas discoveries replaced 99.6
and 115.1 percent of the natural gas produced during
those years [7]. Gas producers, however, are not so sanguine about the future. There has been considerable discussion within the industry that a lack of good gas
drilling prospects might lead to future U.S. supply problems [8].
A number of recent legislative proposals and market
developments in the United States may have long-term
implications for the U.S. natural gas market. On the legislative side, during much of 2002, major energy bills
were debated in the U.S. Congress, particularly the
House of Representatives Bill 4 (H.R. 4) and Senate Bill
1766 (S. 1766). S. 1766 originally proposed a Federal loan

guarantee for an Alaskan gas pipeline, which would
have guaranteed 80 percent of the principal of any loan
made to finance its construction. The loan guarantee was
capped at $10 billion. A later amendment to S. 1766
would have provided additional financial support for
the Alaska gas pipeline in the form of an income tax
credit, which would have become effective when the
average monthly price of natural gas at AECO C Hub in
Alberta fell below $3.25 per million Btu. Any tax credit
collected by shippers would then be subject to being
paid back when the benchmark price went above $4.88
per million Btu. H.R. 4 called for the establishment of a
Federal leasing program that would open the Alaskan
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas production. Both the House and Senate bills called for the
restoration of Section 29 tax credits for coalbed methane
production. Deadlock on a host of issues associated with
these bills prevented the Congress from passing any
comprehensive energy bill during its last session.
On January 10, 2003, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management released the Final Environmental Impact Statement and Proposed Plan Amendment for the Powder
River Basin Oil and Gas Project. This long-delayed
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has constrained
coalbed methane development in Wyomings Powder
River Basin, because development in the area could not
proceed without approval of the EIS [9]. Although a
number of issues were addressed in the EIS, the primary
issue associated with coalbed methane production is the
disposal of water produced in conjunction with the natural gas. Currently, large amounts of water are being
discharged directly on the surface rather than being
reinjected into the ground. Coalbed methane producers
are concerned that a reinjection requirement might be
uneconomical. In contrast, land owners are concerned
that the surface discharge of water will contaminate
streams and aquifers with salty water. Although the EIS
contains a preferred plan for water disposal, it provides
only an analytical basis for Government decisions. In the
formation of those decisions, the issue of water disposal
is likely to remain contentious.
Access to Federal lands has been a perennial political
issue for the natural gas industry, because a considerable portion of the entire U.S. gas resource base both
onshore and offshore is under Federal lease jurisdiction.
Some of the gas resources under Federal lands are completely precluded from development, and development
of others is constrained by Federal lease stipulations
[10]. In November 2000, Congress passed the Energy
Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 2000
(EPCA), which required Federal agencies to conduct an
inventory of oil and gas resources beneath onshore Federal lands. The inventory was to quantify the volumes of
oil and gas resources on Federal lands and to determine
the nature and extent of any restrictions or impediments
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
to their development. Because most of the Federal lands
affected are located in the Rocky Mountain States, the
EPCA Federal inventory focused exclusively on five
major petroleum basins in the region. In January 2003,
the results of the Federal oil and gas resource inventory
were published [11]. The study found that of the 138.5
trillion cubic feet estimated to be under Federal lands in
the Rocky Mountain region, approximately 11.5 percent
is under Federal lands where no leasing is permitted,
and another 26 percent is subject to lease restrictions.
The remaining 62.5 percent can be leased under standard Federal lease terms with no restrictions [12].
On December 18, 2002, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced a new regulatory
policy for LNG regasification terminals [13]. The FERC
announced that new U.S. LNG terminals would no longer be subject to the Commissions open-access and
cost-of-service regulations. Owners would be permitted
to operate new LNG terminals on a private contract
basis and charge market-based rates. The regulatory
change was requested by LNG project sponsors, who
wanted assurance that LNG supplies produced overseas
by their corporate subsidiaries could be guaranteed
access to the U.S. market through their proprietary terminals. The FERCs decision also reduces the financial
risk associated with new LNG facilities, because their
profitability and the profitability of parent companies
upstream facilities (i.e., overseas gas production and liquefaction facilities and LNG tankers) will no longer be
constrained by a tariff rate cap. Collectively, these
changes are expected to reduce LNG project risk and
thus enhance the financial incentive to build new LNG
facilities.
Although the financial risk of building new LNG terminals has been reduced by the new FERC policy, other
industry developments have impaired the financial
circumstances of several LNG project sponsors. For
example, Enron Corporation filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in December 2001, and Dynegy Inc. reported a
$2.8 billion net loss for 2002. Similarly, AES Corporation
reported a 2002 net loss of $3.5 billion, and El Paso Corporations financial difficulties are reflected in its decision to sell $3.4 billion of assets during 2003 [14]. These
four financially challenged companies are unlikely to
build the LNG facilities they had proposed. The four
companies had previously announced intentions to
build approximately 1.6 trillion cubic feet of new LNG
regasification capacity in the United States [15].
Another potential casualty of recent financial problems
is the future implementation of the El Paso Energy
Bridge LNG concept. The construction of new onshore
LNG terminals is expected to encounter considerable
local political opposition. Such opposition, for example,
was cited as one reason for Shell U.S. Gas and Powers
decision to end its participation in a proposal to build
the Mare Island LNG terminal [16]. The El Paso Energy
Bridge concept was to build floating offshore docks
that would allow LNG tankers to unload their cargoes
out of sight of land. It was hoped that the approach
would eliminate the political opposition associated with
onshore facilities. Now that El Paso has decided to exit
the LNG business, this innovative approach to building
and operating new LNG terminals might go untested for
some time.
Many large U.S. corporations have abandoned or
reduced activities in natural gas trading, marketing, and
brokering as a result of financial difficulties. Industry
participants are concerned that the exit of gas traders
will reduce the liquidity and therefore the transparency
of U.S. natural gas markets, leading to increased price
volatility and uncertainty [17]. Increased uncertainty
about future natural gas prices, in turn, would increase
the cost of capital for natural gas exploration and development [18].
Another issue that has arisen is whether a gas pipeline
will be built to transport stranded Alaskan North Slope
gas to the lower 48 gas consumption market. Interest in
building an Alaskan gas pipeline was revived during
the winter of 2000-2001, when natural gas prices were
relatively high. In May 2002, BP, ExxonMobil, and
ConocoPhillips released a joint study that evaluated the
economics of constructing a gas pipeline from the
Alaska North Slope to the lower 48 States [19]. The primary conclusions of the financial analysis were that a
pipeline built from the North Slope Alaska to Chicago
would cost approximately $18.6 to $19.4 billion dollars4
to build (depending on the route used), and that the
pipelines transportation tolls to the lower 48 States
would be between $2.31 to $2.39 per thousand cubic feet.
Even though North Slope oil and gas producers continue to be interested in building an Alaskan gas pipeline, as witnessed by their continued efforts to reduce
pipeline capital costs and regulatory uncertainty, there
are no current indications that the pipelines construction would be completed before 2010 [20].
Canada
Natural gas consumption in Canada is projected to grow
at a rate of 2.3 percent per year between 2001 and 2025.
In 2000, approximately 53 percent of Canadas dry gas
production of 6.3 trillion cubic feet was exported to the
United States [21]. By 2025, net exports of natural gas
from Canada to the United States are projected to be 5.3
trillion cubic feet in the IEO2003 reference case, and Canadas own consumption is projected to be 5.0 trillion
cubic feet [22]. The Canadian National Energy Board
(NEB) estimates that Canada has an undiscovered
potential conventional gas resource base of between 389
and 460 trillion cubic feet [23].
4 The cost estimates include the cost of constructing a natural gas treatment plant and a natural gas liquids extraction plant.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Although Canadas natural gas resources appear adequate for the period through 2025, some concerns have
been raised about the future viability of finding and
developing conventional gas resources. Even though
new Canadian gas discoveries in 2001 replaced 106 percent of its gas production, some producers are concerned that depletion of conventional gas resources
might cause development costs to escalate rapidly, especially in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
(WCSB), which is the primary source of Canadas conventional gas supplies [24]. A recent NEB report [25]
summarizes the situation in the following manner:
An average gas recovery for 2001 connections will be
less than 25 percent of the average gas recovery for 1995
connections. These large reductions in gas recovery per
connection correlate with the diminishing gas supply
response to increasing drilling activity. To compensate
for the lower recovery per connection, an increasing
number of wells has to be drilled to increase or even
maintain overall natural gas production from the
WCSB.
Concern about WCSB conventional gas resources has
also been raised by the rapid production decline of the
Ladyfern gas field, which is thought to contain 1 trillion
cubic feet of recoverable gas and is the largest onshore
gas accumulation found in North America over the past
15 years. By the close of March 2002, 40 Ladyfern wells
were producing 785 million cubic feet per day, 5 percent
of Canadas natural gas stream. In June 2002, however,
the field was producing only 650 million cubic feet per
day, and by the end of 2002 it was expected to be producing only 450 million cubic feet per day [26].
Similar concerns are being expressed with regard to the
size of the offshore Atlantic undiscovered gas resource
base. Although the offshore Atlantic is thought to have
as much as 63 trillion cubic feet of ultimate resources,5
no large discoveries have been made since the Deep
Panuke field (1 trillion cubic feet) was discovered in 1999
[27]. The Deep Panuke is the only new gas field expected
to go into operation by 2006 (at 400 million cubic feet per
day) and only the second offshore gas field to go into
production in East Canada (after Sable Island). Since
1999, exploration results have generally been disappointing, and a number of dry wells have been drilled.
In August 2002, however, the deepwater gas discovery
by EnCana and Marathon Oil revived hopes for more
large finds. The lack of commercial gas discoveries in the
offshore Atlantic caused Eastern Canadian gas reserves
to decline in 2002 by an amount equal to the annual gas
production of the Sable Offshore Energy Project, about
190 billion cubic feet. Given the concerns about depletion of conventional gas resources in both the WCSB and
offshore Atlantic regions, Canadian producers are considering the commercial viability of both conventional
Arctic gas resources and other unconventional gas
resources, especially coalbed methane and gas hydrates.
In the Arctic region of the MacKenzie Delta-Beaufort Sea
(MacKenzie), 9 trillion cubic feet of marketable natural
gas reserves has sparked interest in the construction of a
gas pipeline into Alberta [28]. Another 55 trillion cubic
feet is expected to be discovered [29]. Given the perceived decline in WCSB conventional gas resources, producers have discussed the development of Canadas
Arctic gas resources since 2001. One proposal called for
about 1 billion cubic feet per day of MacKenzie gas to be
transported by an Alaskan gas pipeline, which would
have started on the Alaska North Slope, crossed the
Beaufort Sea to MacKenzie, and then proceeded south to
Alberta. The proposal was scuttled by the Alaska State
Legislature, which mandated that an Alaska North
Slope gas pipeline first go to Fairbanks and then proceed
along the Alaska Highway before entering Alberta.
Since then, the MacKenzie Delta pipeline has been envisioned as a standalone pipeline [30].
Given the uncertainty surrounding the construction of
an Alaska gas pipeline and the expected growth in consumption of Canadian natural gas in both U.S. and
Canadian markets, some developers are considering
expanding the proposed capacity of the MacKenzie
pipeline up to 1.9 billion cubic feet per day [31]. Part of
the pipelines capacity is expected to provide energy for
Canadian tar sands production in Alberta, which
requires about 600 cubic feet to produce each barrel of
tar-sand oil [32]. Whether all the proposed tar sands projects will come to fruition is now under question because
of the Canadian ratification of the Kyoto Treaty on
December 10, 2002 [33].
Canadians are also considering unconventional gas
resources as a supplement for conventional natural gas.
The two principal unconventional gas resources being
examined are coalbed methane and gas hydrates.
Coalbed methane is attractive because the gas resources
are estimated to be quite high, amounting to as much as
135 trillion cubic feet in Alberta alone [34]. The actual
resource is still highly speculative, however, because
there is currently no coalbed methane production in
either Alberta or British Columbia, where the majority of
Canadas coalbed methane resources are located. The
current lack of coalbed methane production reflects both
the low historic cost for developing WCSB conventional
gas resources and unresolved issues about the ownership of mineral rights.
The other potential source of unconventional gas supply
is natural gas hydrates, which consist of methane molecules locked in water crystals. The formation of gas
hydrates occurs under low temperatures and/or high
pressures. Gas hydrate deposits are found offshore in
5 Composed of 18 trillion cubic feet in the Scotian Shelf and 45 trillion cubic feet in the Grand Banks/Labrador areas.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
deepwater sediments and onshore in the Arctic permafrost [35]. Two test wells have been drilled in the MacKenzie Delta region of Canada. The second well, drilled
in 2002, underwent a brief gas production test, which
apparently gave encouraging results. Even if gas
hydrate production is found to be both feasible and profitable, however, development of Canadian resources
would require the construction of a gas pipeline from
the Canadian Arctic to the southern gas markets.6
Mexico
Natural gas consumption in Mexico has grown steadily
over the past decade, from 0.9 trillion cubic feet in 1990
to 1.4 trillion cubic feet in 2001. For most of the decade,
consumption has outpaced production, with the difference being supplied by imports from the United States.
The Mexican government expects natural gas consumption to be double its 2000 levels by 2010. In the IEO2003
reference case, strong growth is expected to continue
throughout the forecast period, with consumption of
natural gas projected to increase at an average annual
rate of 6.1 percent per year between 2001 and 2025,
reaching 5.7 trillion cubic feet in 2025 (Figure 48).
Much of the projected increase in Mexicos gas demand
is expected to be for the industrial sector and for electricity generation. Residential and commercial consumption of natural gas is also expected to increase as a result
of the 1995 privatization of the transmission and distribution sector that has brought natural gas distribution
systems into numerous cities that before had either limited or no access to natural gas. While Mexico is currently satisfying approximately 10 percent of its demand
with imports, the government anticipates that, even if
production grows at an average annual rate of 9 percent,
imports in 2010 will account for closer to 20 percent of
total consumption.
The Mexican governments main concern about increasing imports is price, because domestically produced natural gas is significantly less expensive than imports. The
availability of pipeline capacity for imports from the
United States, at least in the near term, is not a major
issue. There are currently 12 pipeline interconnects
between Mexico and the United States, most capable of
bidirectional flow. The total estimated capacity is
approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day, giving an
annual capacity well in excess of the 268 billion cubic
feet exported to Mexico in 2002 [36]. Pipeline imports
could increase more than fivefold before reaching capacity constraints. In addition to pipeline imports, LNG is
expected to meet some of Mexicos growing demand.
Several LNG receiving facilities have been proposed on
both the eastern and western coasts. Although local
opposition has hindered development of facilities in
Baja California, it is expected that a suitable Baja location
will eventually be agreed upon. Plans along the east
coast are further advanced. The Mexican government
has issued a tender to build a regasification facility by
2006 at Altimira, with proposals due the end of April
2003. Mexicos Federal Electricity Commission has indicated that it will commit to purchase 425 million cubic
feet per day of LNG imports from the facility for 15
years.
Until recently, lack of investment in exploration and
development by Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the
state oil and gas company, kept new discoveries, and
hence production, down. In light of Mexicos expected
high growth in demand, more attention is now being
focused on exploration and development. In September
1999, PEMEX proposed a strategic gas program to
increase both reserves and production. Referred to as
PEG, the program consists of 22 projects, all initiated in
2001, with an expected cumulative capital expenditure
between 2001 and 2009 of $8.1 billion. In 2001 $1.6 billion
was spent, funding the largest seismic and drilling activity in Mexico since the 1980s. Seven new fields were discovered, six offshore and one onshore, and 1.8 trillion
cubic feet was added to reserves. The most promising of
the new fields, the Lankahuasa, is located in shallow
waters in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and may contain
up to 1 trillion cubic feet of reserves. Another promising
discovery is the Playuela area of the Veracruz basin,
which has reactivated this mature gas-producing basin.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
PEMEXs goals for the next 5 to 10 years include exploration in new areas, particularly nonassociated basins7
and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico8; reduction of finding
and production costs; application of new technology in
mature fields; strengthening the capabilities of technical
personnel; and increasing foreign involvement. Two
challenges that could slow the progress of the ambitious
PEMEX plan are lack of autonomy in decisionmaking
and the need to negotiate budgets with the government.
The PEMEX business plan is expected to increase production significantly, even without foreign involvement, but its efforts alone will not be sufficient to achieve
the Fox Administrations goal of eliminating imports by
2010. Because it lacks the financial resources to develop
the countrys reserves fully on its own, the government
feels that it is imperative to open the natural gas production sector to private investment. At present, private
companies can provide services to PEMEX but are prohibited by the constitution from holding any share of
ownership in any of Mexicos natural resources. A new
contractual arrangement known as the Multiple Service
Contract (MSC) has been developed by PEMEX to
replace the current arrangement with contractors providing oil and gas related services. The MSC is considered to be a key element for future development.
Although PEMEX will maintain strict control over
exploration and production in accordance with the Mexican constitution, the new arrangement has been
designed to open new opportunities and investment
areas in the natural gas industry and to make participation more attractive to investors. It is hoped that the new
MSC will attract sufficient foreign investment to supplement PEMEXs to the point that enough gas can be produced to satisfy demand by 2010. The initial emphasis
will be on getting contracts in place for development
efforts in the Burgos Basin9 in northeastern Mexico,
where PEMEX feels the largest production increase
could be achieved.
The Fox Administrations immediate goalto double
production in the Burgos Basin from 1 to 2 billion cubic
feet per day within the next 3 yearsdepends on the
acceptance of the MSC. There is still resistance within
Mexico on constitutional grounds, however, and lawyers continue to evaluate the issue. In addition, PEMEX
labor unions have strongly opposed foreign involvement in the past and will most likely continue to do so.
Although significant interest has been generated among
investors, many remain skeptical as to its true benefits.
Features that PEMEX feels will be attractive to contractors include PEMEXs commitment to produce at least
1 billion cubic feet per day from MSCs by 2007, its
guarantee that all work under the contracts will be performed in areas with certified gas reserves, the length of
the contracts (20 or so years, compared with the current
1 to 2 years), and unit pricing for work units performed
that will reward efficiency regardless of production.
The primary disadvantage of the MSC for potential
investors is that PEMEX will retain ownership of all
resources and of all works performed. President Vicente
Fox has had difficulty in his attempts to restructure Mexicos energy markets since he took office on December 1,
2000, because his party lacks a majority in both of the
Mexican governments legislative bodies. Consequently, he has narrowed his immediate focus to one
primary area, that of opening up exploration and development of nonassociated gas to private investment.
PEMEX will initially offer eight blocks in the Burgos
Basin for exploration and development through the
MSC. The blocks contain proven reserves of 800 billion
cubic feet and potential reserves of 3 to 4 trillion cubic
feet. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded
by September 2003 [37].
Although Mexico is making progress with efforts to
open its upstream natural gas market, the lack of emphasis in the past has left the country unable to develop its
resources fast enough to keep pace with the rapid
growth in demand that is anticipated, at least in the near
term. Mexico is thus expected to be a net importer of natural gas from the United States at least through 2015. If
the governments goal of infrastructure development
along with the development of additional sources of
supply, such as LNG, is met, then after 2015 the country
could become a net exporter. Mexico is expected to
become a net exporter to the United States after 2019,
and its net exports to the United States are projected to
reach 0.7 trillion cubic feet per year by 2025 [38].
Western Europe
Natural gas remains the fastest growing fuel source in
Western Europe, in spite of dwindling indigenous supplies. In the IEO2003 reference case, Western Europes
natural gas consumption is projected to almost double
over the forecast period, growing at an average annual
rate of 2.4 percent, from 14.8 trillion cubic feet in 2001 to
25.9 trillion cubic feet by 2025 (Figure 49). Such growth
would mean increased dependence on imports to satisfy
requirements for natural gas. By one recent estimate,
Western Europes import dependence for natural gas is
projected to reach 60 percent by 2020 [39]. With the
exception of small quantities exported by France, Germany, and Norway to Eastern Europe, all Western European production is consumed in the region.
7 Most of Mexicos reserves lie in the south and are associated with oil production. Because sufficient infrastructure to move the gas to
major consuming centers in the north is lacking, a significant amount of natural gas is flared.
8 Most offshore production is currently from very shallow wells.
9 The Burgos Basin currently accounts for close to 25 percent of Mexicos production. In production since 1945, it is both the only major
field in northern Mexico and the only major field producing nonassociated gas.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Most of the regions resources are concentrated in the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Norway. All
three countries currently produce more than they consume and export the balance. Of the other Western European countries, only Denmark produced more than it
consumed in 2001, exporting the balance to Germany
and Sweden; and only Austria, Italy, and Germany produced more than 20 percent of what they consumed.
France, the fifth largest natural gas consumer in Western
Europe in 2001, produced less than 5 percent of what it
consumed. Currently, the primary sources for imports
of natural gas to Western Europe are Russia and Algeria
for pipeline imports, as well as numerous sources,
including Algeria, for LNG. France, Spain, and Italy are
Europes biggest importers of LNG, supported by
exports from (in order of volume in 2001) Algeria, Nigeria, Qatar, Oman, Libya, Trinidad and Tobago, the
United Arab Emirates, and others.
The United Kingdom is at present Western Europes
largest producer and second largest consumer of natural
gas. For the past several years it has been a net exporter
of natural gas, sending supplies to the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Belgium in 2001 [40]. The
United Kingdom is also Western Europes oldest gas
market, with many large, older gas fields that are or will
soon be in decline. As a result, no significant growth in
production is expected without new finds. With the
IEO2003 projecting gas consumption in the United Kingdom to grow from 3.3 trillion cubic feet in 2001 to 5.0 trillion cubic feet in 2025, other sources of natural gas will
be needed.

Centrica, a major UK energy supplier, already has entered into import agreements to start in 2005 with Statoil
of Norway and Gasunie of the Netherlands. Arrangements have also been made with ExxonMobil for LNG
from Qatar to begin flowing to the United Kingdom by
2007. Plans for new import pipelines are under consideration, with the Netherlands proposing a pipeline traversing the North Sea and Marathon and Statoil both
proposing pipelines to bring gas from the North Sea
(and potentially the large Norwegian Ormen Lange10
field) to the United Kingdom. All three proposals would
bring gas to Bacton, the delivery point for gas from
Zeebruge, Belgium via the Interconnector pipeline,
which is one of two currently existing pipelines used to
import gas into the United Kingdom. The other is the
Vesterland (previously Frigg) pipeline from Norway,
Western Europes second largest producer, which delivers gas to St. Fergus, Scotland. Plans have been
announced to add compression that will almost triple
the capacity of the Interconnector by 2005.
In addition to proposed international pipelines, the
United Kingdom has several domestic pipelines that
deliver gas from its own North Sea fields with spare
capacity that could easily be linked to Norwegian offshore fields. Norway exports a significant amount of
natural gas via pipeline and is also entering the LNG
market. Europes largest liquefaction plant is being built
to process gas from the Snohvit and other fields in the
Barents Sea for the international Snohvit Group, a consortium of oil companies that includes the Norwegian
Statoil ASA, Norsk Hydro, and French TotalFinaElf S.A.
The plant is expected to go into production by 2006 [41].
The largest supplier of natural gas imports to Western
Europe is Russia, and those imports continue to grow. In
the first 7 months of 2002, Western European imports of
Russian gas increased by 5.4 percent over the same
period in 2001 [42]. Russia has plans to increase its presence in Western European markets by building a pipeline that would bypass Ukraine and Poland (to avoid
high transport fees and unauthorized diversion of gas)
and initially transport gas from the Yamal Peninsula in
Western Siberia to Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The
intention is to extend the pipeline subsequently to the
Netherlands via Germany and then along the floor of the
North Sea to the United Kingdom [43].
Natural gas will continue to flow to Western European
markets through Ukraine, but Ukraines aging pipeline
system has deteriorated to the point that it is operating
at only 50 percent of capacity. Steps are being taken to
bolster Ukraines transmission system. In early October
2002, the Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers took
initial steps toward setting up an international consortium to manage and develop Ukraines natural gas
transmission system for a 30-year period. Several key
10 Ormen Lange is the second largest natural gas field discovered to date in Norwegian waters.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
issues, such as how shares in the venture should be distributed, remain to be resolved, but if the proposed
upgrading of the system occurs, it will allow a significant increase in Russias export capacity to Western
Europe [44]. Western Europe also imports gas from
other former Soviet Republics, notably, Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.
Another important source of natural gas supply for
Western Europe is North Africa, and transport capacity
between Europe and North Africa is being increased.
North Africa (primarily Algeria) is Western Europes
second largest supplier, delivering supplies via pipeline
to Italy, Spain, and Portugal and by LNG tanker to
France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece, and Portugal.
Sonatrach, Algerias national gas company, has an interest in a proposed LNG regasification terminal in Spain
and is involved in a new venture with Gaz de France to
market Algerian gas in Europe. A feasibility study has
been completed for a pipeline to link Algeria with Spain,
and construction is scheduled to begin in 2003. The pipeline is being constructed as a joint venture between
Sonatrach and several leading European energy groups,
including Cepsa, BP, Endesea, ENI, Gaz de France, and
TotalFinaElf [45]. Algeria is increasing its exploration
activities and encouraging foreign investment in the further development of its natural gas transmission and
export activities. Egypt is also expected to become a supplier of gas to Western Europe [46].
Supplies of natural gas from Iran could also make their
way to Western Europe. Iran has recently completed a
pipeline link to Turkey, which it hopes is the first step
toward providing supplies to Europe. The International
Energy Agency, in its World Energy Outlook 2002, indicates that Iran, with its abundant gas supplies, is likely to
become a major European gas supplier in the future [47].
Other options for moving Iranian gas to Europe are LNG
by tanker and a pipeline through Armenia to Georgia
and then on to Ukraine for ultimate delivery to Europe.
The most expeditious solution will most likely be the
completion and expansion of the pipeline project currently delivering Iranian gas to Turkey [48].
Turkey has also expressed considerable interest in entering the Western European natural gas market. The Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister, Zeki Cakan,
has stated that preparations have been made to export
natural gas to both Eastern and Western Europe. He
indicated that Turkey would be signing an agreement to
supply Greece with natural gas and was prepared to
export gas not only to Greece but also to Austria, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina [49]. The Austrian
energy and chemicals group OMV and Hungarian oil,
gas, and petrochemicals company MOL have agreed
with the energy firms Botas (of Turkey), Bulgargaz (Bulgaria), and Transgaz (Romania) to undertake a 1.5-year
feasibility study for a natural gas pipeline that would
link Turkey with Austria via Bulgaria, Romania, and
Hungary to satisfy growing demand in Eastern and
Western Europe [50].
The European Union (EU) has set a major goal to create a
single market for all aspects of trade and commerce by
2010. Important to the achievement of that goal is the liberalization of European energy markets. Virtually all
European natural gas markets were founded as nationalized industries with limited, if any, participation by
private companies [51]. The EUs legislation has played
a significant role in the domestic energy policies of member countries, providing a framework for opening up
both electricity markets and natural gas markets in
member nations to competition.
The EUs Natural Gas Directive, passed in June 1998,
required the opening of natural gas markets. It set deadlines for members (with the exception of emerging markets in Portugal and Greece) to have arrangements in
place for third-party access to gas infrastructure, with
target dates for individual customers set according to
consumption levels. As a result of the Directive, markets
in Germany and the United Kingdom were 100 percent
open by 2000. Markets in Austria, France, Greece, and
Portugal were less than 40 percent open, and all other
EU member countries were between 40 and 99 percent
open. By 2008, the European Commission projects that
natural gas markets in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands,
Spain, and Sweden will also be 100 percent open. The
opening of gas markets is being accompanied by major
changes, with nationalized gas companies being privatized, various components of the gas supply chain being
bought and sold, and companies joining together to
form trading alliances. These ongoing changes will facilitate cross-border trading, making a significant contribution toward meeting Europes growing natural gas
needs.
Industrialized Asia
The three countries of industrialized AsiaJapan, Australia, and New Zealandsaw relatively strong annual
growth in natural gas use from 1990 to 20012.5 percent
per year in Australia, 2.8 percent in New Zealand, and
4.0 percent in Japan. Over the projection period, the
expansion of gas consumption in Japan is expected to
slow considerably, increasing by a modest 1.0 percent
per year between 2001 and 2025, whereas natural gas use
in Australia and New Zealand combined is projected to
grow by a robust 2.7 percent per year (Figure 50). Australia has only recently begun to exploit its vast natural
gas resources for domestic use and in both Australia and
New Zealand strong economic growth is expected to be
accompanied by increasing natural gas consumption
over the forecast period.
Japan
Japan is by far the largest importer of LNG in the world
and, with few indigenous gas resources and limited
options for pipeline imports, is expected to remain so for
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
the foreseeable future. In 2001, Japan imported 2,615 billion cubic feet of LNG, accounting for more than onehalf of the LNG traded worldwide [52]. In 2002, seven
nuclear power plants operated by the Tokyo Electric
Power Company (TEPCO) were shut down after the
announcement by Japans Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Administration of suspicions that the utility had falsely
reported the results of safety inspections on the reactors
beginning in the mid-1980s; and by April 2003 operations had been suspended at all 17 of TEPCOs reactors,
pending inspection [53]. Both TEPCO and the Chubu
Electric Power Companythe latter with 3 nuclear reactors temporarily shut down for scheduled maintenance
and another for unscheduled inspectionhave been
relying on natural gas (along with coal- and oil-fired
generation) to meet high winter demand for electricity.
Australia
Australias proven natural gas reserves are currently
estimated at 90 trillion cubic feet, second in size only to
Indonesia among the countries of the Asia/Pacific
region. In spite of the countrys vast resources, Australia
has been fairly slow to advance the use of natural gas,
which accounted for less than one-fifth of its total energy
consumption in 2001. Natural gas is expected to gain
market share of total energy consumption over the projection period as regulatory changes that have restructured the natural gas industry take hold and the pipeline
infrastructure is expanded. The industrial sector currently is the largest consumer of natural gas in Australia,

Australia/NewZealand
Japan
Although the Australian gas distribution network presently supplies some 3 million residential and 80,000
commercial customers, the pipeline system is fairly dispersed and fragmented and will have to be expanded to
meet growing consumer demand for natural gas. In
2002, the country completed a 455-mile pipeline to Tasmania and started construction on a second hub, the
so-called VicHub in Longford, Victoria [54]. There are
currently plans to add some 5,000 miles of gas pipeline
to the Australian system, including construction of a
2,000-mile pipeline to connect Australias Queensland
with Papua New Guinea.
Australia began exporting LNG in 1989 [55] and currently is the third largest LNG producer worldwide,
after Indonesia and Malaysia. Australia plans to expand
its Northwest Shelf Project by a fourth train,11 adding 4.2
million metric tons of new capacity to the existing 8.0
million metric tons by 2004 [56]. The marketing company Australia Pty Ltd was able to secure a long-term
contract to supply Chinas Guangdong regasification
terminal with LNG beginning in 2005 when the terminal
is scheduled for completion. Australia has also supplied
substantial amounts of LNG to Japan and modest
amounts on the spot market to the United States and
South Korea.
New Zealand
In contrast to Australia, New Zealand has fairly modest
natural gas resources. In 2003, the countrys proven natural gas reserves stood at 3.1 trillion cubic feet. New Zealands largest natural gas field, the Maui field in the
Taranaki Basin, is now in decline, prompting many
industry and government officials to speculate that
without additional, large gas finds, New Zealand could
exhaust its reserves within the next decade [57]. There is
concern that too few resources are being invested in natural gas exploration, creating the potential for shortages
in the mid-term.
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
and increased use of natural gas for electricity generation is expected over the forecast horizon.

As of January 1, 2003, the FSU held 36 percent of the
worlds natural gas reserves. In 2001 the FSU accounted
for about 28 percent of the worlds natural gas production, and 80 percent of the regions production was
attributable to Russia. Russias natural gas production in
2001 was second only to the United States, which produced 22.5 percent of the worlds total compared with
Russias 22.0 percent. Growth in natural gas production
and consumption among the EE/FSU countries was
11 An LNG train is an independent unit for gas liquefaction. An LNG liquefaction plant comprises one or more LNG trains, and individual trains may vary in size. Significant capital costs are incurred in the construction a new LNG facility (known as a greenfield project),
because infrastructure, such as ship terminals, must be built. With infrastructure already in place, it is more cost-effective to add a train to an
existing LNG plant than to build a new facility.

mixed. Overall production within the FSU increased by
0.4 percent between 2000 and 2001, with decreases of 2.0
percent in Azerbaijan and 0.5 percent in Russia offset by
increases of 9.1 percent in Turkmenistan, 2.3 percent in
Ukraine, and 1.8 percent in Uzbekistan. While consumption dropped by 4.0 percent in Ukraine and 1.2 percent
in Russia, a gain of 55.2 percent in Azerbaijan coupled
with modest gains in other FSU countries overshadowed the losses, allowing the FSU to post an overall
increase in consumption of 0.3 percent. This is the fourth
consecutive year in which consumption in the FSU has
increased, reflecting the regions continuing economic
recovery.
Eastern Europe, Russias second largest market, received 1,352 billion cubic feet and accounted for just
over 30 percent of Russias international natural gas
trade. The other major recipient of Russian gas was Turkey, receiving 386 billion cubic feet or 8.6 percent of the
total, up by 7.7 percent from 2000 levels [59]. Although
Russias exports to Eastern and Western Europe decreased between 2000 and 2001, they are now on the rise.
The Interfax News Agencys October 10, 2002, Petroleum
Report indicated that figures for the first 9 months of
2002 showed overall exports to all of Europe (including
Turkey) increasing by 3.8 percent over the same period
in 2001.
Although unstable political and economic conditions in
the early to mid-1990s led to significant declines in
EE/FSU natural gas markets, conditions have improved
considerably since then, and consumption continues to
grow; however, the regions total consumption level of
24 trillion cubic feet in 2001 fell short of the 28 trillion
cubic feet consumed in 1990. Restructuring of EE/FSU
gas markets still is progressing, and the climate for foreign investment is improving. As a result, the IEO2003
forecast projects robust growth, with consumption
increasing at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent, to 46
trillion cubic feet in 2025 (Figure 51). Growth in Eastern
Europe is expected to outpace growth in the FSU, with
Eastern European consumption projected to grow at an
average annual rate of 4.6 percent, compared with 2.6
percent for the FSU. One reason for the sizeable difference is that most of the countries in Eastern Europe have
enjoyed sustained economic recovery since the early
1990s, giving them a head start over the former Soviet
Republics, which have only recently begun to see sustained positive economic growth.
Notable in the EE/FSU has been the completion of major
pipeline projects, the growth of international trade
agreements, and progress on several infrastructure
expansion proposals to facilitate international trade.
Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are once
again discussing a $3.2 billion gas pipeline, known as the
Trans-Afghanistan pipeline, to provide Turkmenistan
supplies to the latter two countries. Originally planned
in 1997, it was put on hold because of tensions between
Afghanistan and Pakistan; however, the political climate
has improved since the fall of the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan and Pakistans renunciation of the Taliban
after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the
United States [60].
Russia dominated world trade movements in 2001,
accounting for 31 percent of all natural gas pipeline
exports and 23 percent of all international gas trade.
The only other FSU country with any significant international trade was Turkmenistan, accounting for 1.0
percent of international pipeline movements with deliveries of 148 billion cubic feet to Iran, up sharply from 95
billion cubic feet in 2000. More than 60 percent of Russias exports went to Western Europe. Out of a total of
2,740 billion cubic feet, 1,172 billion cubic feet went to
Germany, 688 billion cubic feet to Italy, and 395 billion
cubic feet to France, Russias three main Western European markets. The remainder of Russias exports to
Western Europe went primarily to Austria, Finland,
Greece, the Netherlands, and Switzerland [58]. Russias
exports to Western Europe in 2001 declined by 3.8 percent from 2000 levels, primarily because of lower
deliveries to Italy. Italy increased imports from the
Netherlands and began receiving supplies from Norway
by way of the new Les Marches du Nord-Est pipeline in
France.
Russia is exploring options to export natural gas to
China, and the two countries are conducting a feasibility
study that is expected to be completed by the end of June
2003. The gas would be supplied from Siberian gas fields
in Irkutsk to provinces in Northeast China beginning in

2008 [61]. South Korea has also become a party to the
endeavor. Although pipeline routes through Mongolia
and Manchuria have been proposed, another possibility
is the development of a liquefaction facility so that the
gas could be transported as LNG to markets other than
China. Preliminary plans for an LNG facility call for 7
million metric tons of LNG per year for 10 years beginning in 2008 or 2010 [62]; however, such ambitious plans
are unlikely to reach fruition before 2015.
In 2002, a long-term natural gas supply agreement
between Norways Statoil and Poland was reached, with
Statoil agreeing to begin sending supplies in 2008
through a dedicated pipeline to be constructed from the
North Sea to Poland. Plans currently are on hold because
of a slowdown in the Polish economy, which has
resulted in a corresponding decrease in the need for natural gas, but Statoil may increase supplies to Poland via
Germany until demand picks up enough to make the
pipeline viable [63]. Poland has also contracted with
Russia for supplies to be delivered through the Yamal
pipeline. The original agreement is for close to 9 trillion
cubic feet of gas to be delivered by 2020 under a
take-or-pay agreement. While Poland still wants supplies from Russia, the government is anxious to renegotiate the amount. The economic slowdown the country is
experiencing, coupled with overly optimistic demand
projections that the previous government used when the
contract was first negotiated, has led to a substantial
overcommitment on Polands part. Poland has proposed that the amount be reduced by 50 percent,
whereas Russia is proposing 30 percent [64]. Meanwhile,
because producing its own gas is significantly cheaper
than importing it from Russia, the Polish government
has made increasing gas production a priority, stating
that it hopes to increase production by 50 percent in 2007
[65].
Europe is Russias primary export market, but Turkey
has long been felt to have strong potential as an outlet for
Russian gas. Currently Russias fastest growing export
market, Turkey is in a position to overtake France as
Russias third largest foreign customer. Exports to Turkey for the first 9 months of 2002 were up by 14 percent
from the same period in 2001 and are expected to grow
further as a result of the recent opening of the Blue
Stream pipeline in October 2002. The growth will not be
as strong as originally anticipated, however, because
Turkeys economic problems have reduced previously
estimated demand requirements [66]. Finally a reality,
the Blue Stream pipeline has been in the works since
Russia and Turkey signed an agreement on December
15, 1997. The project faced competition from the rival
Shah-Deniz pipeline, which was proposed to bring gas
from Azerbaijans Shah-Deniz gas field to Turkey. A
major find for Azerbaijan, the Shah-Deniz field is estimated to contain more than 3 trillion cubic feet of
reserves. Plans to develop the field and build the
pipeline to Turkey have been delayed because of both
significant cost increases and the uncertainty of Turkeys
future demand for gas.
Russia is looking beyond supplying Turkey with natural
gas via the Blue Stream pipeline, anticipating that Turkey will become a future transit route to Europe that will
bypass Ukraine, Romania, and Bulgaria. Before the Blue
Stream was opened, all Russian supplies entering Turkey transited those three countries. The Blue Stream is
not Russias only attempt to bypass Ukraine in delivering natural gas to Europe. Gazprom has completed the
second line of the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which transports gas from Russias Yamal Peninsula to Germany via
Belarus and Poland [67]. The first Yamal-Europe line
transits Belarus and Ukraine en route to Europe.
In the past, strained relations between Russia and
Ukraine regarding the transport of Russian gas led Russia to seek alternate routes to Europe. Tensions arose
from Ukraines failure to keep current in its payments
for gas imported from Russia and from Russias accusation that Ukraine was siphoning gas during transit.
There is encouraging evidence that agreements have
been reached and relations between the two countries
are improving. According to Ukraine, Gazprom has
agreed to transport about 4 trillion cubic feet of gas
through Ukraine, paying part of the transit fee by providing the country with 900 billion cubic feet of gas and
the rest in cash. Ukraine has also signed a contract with
Russia for the transport of gas from Turkmenistan to
Ukraine at a more favorable cost than that currently in
effect and established an agreement that will allow
Ukraine to export its own gas under Gazproms export
contracts [68]. In October 2002, Ukraine and Russia
signed an agreement to set up an international consortium to refurbish and run Ukraines aging pipeline system, which is badly in need of repair [69]. Initially
consisting of Ukraine, Germany, and Russia, the consortium is open to all leading European companies.
There are still issues to be resolved before EE/FSU natural gas markets are fully developed and open, but the
state of the market today is far superior to that of the
early to mid-1990s, when gas markets in most EE/FSU
countries were almost completely controlled by the government and efforts at privatization and foreign involvement were just beginning to develop.
A positive trend has been the improving climate for foreign investment, which is vital to the full development
of the regions gas markets. An example is the readiness
of major European businesses to invest in Russias key
natural gas projects, such as the development of the
Barents Sea Shtokmanovaski offshore gas fields, the
Yamal-Europe pipeline, and the Northern European
pipeline from Vyborg in Russia through Finland and
under the Baltic Sea to Europe. The Northern European
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Pipeline, expected to be completed by 2009, carries a
price tag of $5.7 billion [70]. The combined cost of all
three projects is estimated to be between $25 and $30 billion, and Russia does not have the means to complete
them without foreign involvement.
Interest in the projects was affirmed after a Russia-EU
roundtable conference on the natural gas industry in
December 2002. According to Alexi Miller, Gazproms
CEO, Gazprom has already negotiated with Shell, BP,
and Centrica in the United Kingdom, Fortum in Finland,
and Ruhrgas, Wintershall, and BASF in Germany, all of
which expressed interest in the construction of the
Northern European pipeline. The pipeline would provide Russian gas initially to Finland, Sweden, and Denmark; later to the Netherlands via Germany; and finally
to the United Kingdom through a segment crossing the
floor of the North Sea [71]. Although issues surrounding
market liberalization and contract structure for gas sales
are items that still need to be addressed before any final
agreements can be reached, this is a positive step forward for Russia [72].
In addition to possible foreign investments in its projects, Gazprom has its own ambitious investment program for 2003. The Russian giants plans are to increase
total investment by 50 percent over 2000 levels, with 8
percent of the total investment earmarked for boosting
extraction and transportation of natural gas and to maintain existing pipelines [73]. Gazprom is also relinquishing a degree of its control over the Russian gas market.
While it remains Russias largest producer, independent
gas companies are slowly increasing their share of the
market. As an example, Russian gas company Nortgaz,
a member of Soyugaz, Russias union of independent
gas producers, doubled its 2001 production in 2002 and
plans to more than triple its 2002 output by 2005. Currently Gazprom accounts for close to 90 percent of Russias production, but it has been projected that by 2020
independent gas companies will account for about 30
percent of production. Current obstacles faced by the
independents include a lack of equal access to pipelines,
need for more favorable tax consideration, and difficulty
in achieving profitability. Given the current market
structure, their profitability is less than 0.5 percent,
whereas Gazproms profitability is between 15 and 20
percent [74].
Developing Asia
generation in order to diversify electricity fuel mixes.
Both China and India, two of the largest energy consumers in the region, have been making strong efforts to
increase their natural gas supplies and to develop the
infrastructure needed to bring gas to market. China and
India together account for 55 percent of the expected
regional increment in natural gas use, with projected
average annual increases of 7.9 percent and 6.1 percent,
respectively.
China
Chinas natural gas use currently accounts for a relatively small share of its total energy mix, only about 3
percent in 2001. In recent years, however, the Chinese
government has made several moves toward increasing
the penetration of natural gas in the country. Along with
a number of aggressive moves in exploring its own natural gas resources, China has begun constructing LNG
regasification terminals and several gas pipeline projects. The government has announced plans to ensure
that Beijings natural gas infrastructure is fully operational in time for it to host the 2008 Olympic summer
games. In an effort to secure the Olympic games for
Beijing, China committed $12 billion to reduce the pollution in the city, one facet of which will be to convert businesses from coal to natural gas [75]. Shanghai has
announced that it will stop building coal-fired electric
power plants and speed up the construction of naturalgas-fired plants [76].
In general, Chinas natural gas infrastructure is rudimentary. The largest gas pipeline distribution system is
in the southwestern province of Sichuan, where some
5,400 miles of natural gas pipeline serves both industrial

In the IEO2003 reference case forecast, natural gas consumption is expected to expand strongly among the
countries of developing Asia (Figure 52). Between 2001
and 2025, natural gas use is projected to increase by 4.5
percent per year in the region, about twice the rate projected for the countries of the industrialized world.
Many countries in developing Asia are attempting to
increase natural gas use, particularly for electricity

chemical plants and residential consumers. The country
has plans to increase gas supplies substantially and to
expand the natural gas pipeline network in the near
future. The most ambitious of the planned pipelines is
the 2,600-mile West-to-East pipeline currently under
construction, which will connect gas fields in Chinas
sparsely populated west to urban markets in the east,
initially running from the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Province to Shanghai and subsequently connecting to Beijing
through a 200-mile link.
Several major urban centers have made plans to expand
and interconnect their natural gas pipeline distribution
networks. In January 2002, PetroChina signed a contract
to install 470 miles of pipe that will connect 11 cities in
the central provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan [77].
A 470-mile pipeline that was originally supposed to be
constructed by the now bankrupt Enron Corporation to
link Zhongxian in southwestern Chinas Chongqing
Municipality to central Hubei Province will be completed by PetroChina, alone or with an alternative partner [78]. The $600 million project will deliver 106 billion
cubic feet of natural gas each year to urban centers such
as Wuhan, Changsha, and Zhuzhou. Another 300-mile
pipeline to connect the Changqing gas field to the Inner
Mongolian city of Hohhot is currently under construction and scheduled for completion before the end of 2003
[79]. The $100 million project is expected to transport
some 34 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year to the
city.
In addition to pipeline projects that will bring Chinese
natural gas to market, PetroChina is negotiating with
Russia for the import of about 700 billion cubic feet of
natural gas per year from Russias Kovytka field in 2008
through an extension of the West-to-East pipeline. Talks
between China and Russia about constructing a natural
gas pipeline from eastern Siberia to the Bohai Bay region
of northeastern China also began in mid-2002 [80]. A feasibility study is currently underway and scheduled for
completion by June 2003 [81].
There are also plans to introduce facilities for LNG in
China. One LNG regasification facility is already under
construction at Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, and
there are plans to build other plants in Fujian and
Shandong. In August 2002, state-owned China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) secured supplies
for the LNG plant from Australias Northwest Shelf with
Australian marketing company Australia LNG Pty [82].
The 25-year contract will begin in 2005, with the completion of the Guangdong import terminal, when an initial
3.0 million metric tons of LNG will begin to be delivered,
rising to 5.0 million metric tons in 2008. In September
2002, BP-Pertamina and CNOOC signed an agreement
for the latter to purchase 2.6 million metric tons of LNG
from Indonesias Tangguh field located in the province
of Papua, beginning in 2007 [83].
India
In the IEO2003 reference case projection, natural gas use
in India advances strongly between 2001 and 2025, by
6.1 percent per year. Although gas use in the country is
currently only 0.8 trillion cubic feet, India has plans to
increase both imports and domestic production over the
next few years. By 2025, natural gas consumption is projected to reach 3.4 trillion cubic feet.
Natural gas consumption is concentrated largely in
Indias industrial and electricity generation sectors.
Most of the future growth in natural gas demand is
expected to be for power generation, as a result of
government incentives to increase gas-fired generating
plants along the Indias coastal areas where LNG will be
received [84]. The Indian government has ambitious
plans to expand the existing 2,000 miles of natural
gas distribution pipelines. Projects already underway
include a 380-mile pipeline to connect Visakhapatnam to
Secunderabad in the state of Andra Pradesh and a
440-mile pipeline to connect Mangalore in Karnataka to
Madurai in Tamil Nadu [85].
With the fast-paced growth projected for natural gas
demand in India, it is likely that the country will have to
import substantial amounts of natural gas to meet its
needs in the future. At present, Indias gas imports are
solely in the form of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
There have been several proposals in recent years to
develop both pipeline and LNG imports. Indias political relationships with neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh have made it difficult to advance plans for
pipelines to import gas through those two countries.
There have been on-again, off-again talks between India
and Oman, Iran, Bangladesh, and more recently Russia,
but so far they have not resulted in any firm plans to
develop a natural gas import pipeline.
As a result of the difficulties in establishing the infrastructure for importing natural gas via pipeline, much of
the near-term growth in Indias gas imports is likely to
be in the form of LNG. The countrys first LNG
regasification terminal, Petronets 5 million metric ton
facility at Dahej in Gugarat, is scheduled to become
operational by the end of 2003. There are currently eight
LNG terminal projects under various stages of completion or under consideration in India.
The Indian government is also aggressively pursuing
exploration for domestic natural gas. The country currently holds proven reserves of 26 trillion cubic feet,
with most resources centered in the Bombay High offshore complex, Gujarat state (both on and offshore), the
Brahmaputra valley in the northeast of the country, and
Andra Pradesh. In January 2003, the discovery of the
largest gas field to date in India, in the Krishna Godavari
Basin, was announced [86]. Located off the eastern coast
of India, the field is estimated to contain between 5 and 7
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The latest find has led
some analysts to question the extent to which India will
need to rely on imports to meet its natural gas demand.
South Korea
South Korea has had some difficulty in securing sufficient LNG supplies in 2003. State-owned Korea Gas Corporation (Kogas) opted to delay renewing or signing any
new LNG contract supply agreements in 2002 as it
awaited a pending government decision about restructuring the countrys natural gas markets [87]. This left
the company much more dependent on spot markets for
its supplies. According to Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, the company required an estimated 40 additional LNG spot cargoes to meet the countrys natural
gas demand for what has become an unusually cold
winter. Unfortunately, at the same time, Japanese utilities were forced to search for their own additional spot
market purchases of LNG to fuel gas-fired electric
power plants that were needed as a result of Japans
nuclear power plant inspection scandal, which had
closed 17 nuclear power plants by April 2003.
The result has been a very tight LNG market for South
Korea in early 2003. Korea is currently wholly dependent upon LNG imports for its natural gas supplies. The
country is second only to Japan as an LNG importer
worldwide. South Korea has contracts to purchase LNG
from a wide range of countries, including Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Qatar, with smaller amounts from Brunei
and Oman [88]. In January 2003, Kogas signed a 7-year
purchase agreement with Australias North West Shelf
LNG for 500,000 metric tons of LNG per year, starting in
late 2003 [89]. Natural gas demand in South Korea has
been increasing steadily since the countrys recovery
from the Asian economic crisis of 1998, and natural gas
use is expected to increase by a robust 3.9 percent per
year over the 2001-2025 forecast period.
Other Developing Asia
Indonesia and Malaysia are the largest natural gas producers in developing Asia. They account for a substantial amount of Asias gas exports, both by way of
pipeline (to Singapore) and in liquefied form (to Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan). In 2002, Brunei and Australia
were the only other Asian gas producers that exported
natural gas, both in LNG form.
Natural gas is becoming an increasingly important
export commodity for Indonesia, which is now the
worlds largest LNG exporter, accounting for about
one-fifth of the world export market in 2001 [90]. With
an estimated 92.5 trillion cubic feet in estimated proven
gas reserves, Indonesia possesses ample resources to
support domestic markets and exports [91]. LNG is processed at the countrys two liquefaction plants, PT Arun
LNG at Lhokseumaw in Aceh and Bongtang LNG in
East Kalimantan. A third plant is being developed by BP
at Tangguh to supply China with LNG for its Fujian
regasification terminal beginning in 2007 [92]. There
have been problems associated with the Aceh facility; an
insurgency group seeking independence for the island
launched a series of attacks in 2001 that caused operator
ExxonMobil to suspend operations for 3 months. The
bombing of a night club frequented by western tourists
in Bali in 2002 may also discourage foreign companies
from investing in the Indonesian energy sector in the
short term.
Indonesia has recognized the need to expand its domestic distribution systems for natural gas in order to fuel
gas-fired electric power generation in a country where
electricity demand is rapidly increasing. Between 1995
and 2000, net electricity consumption increased by a
robust 10.3 percent per year in Indonesia, even with the
economic slowdown that occurred during the 1997-1998
Asian financial crisis, ultimately bringing widespread
social unrest that resulted in the ouster of President
Suharto in May 1998 [93]. The state-owned gas distribution company, Perum Gas Negara (PGN), currently
operates around 2,800 miles of natural gas pipeline
throughout Indonesia, with another 1,100 miles of pipeline currently under construction [94]. PGN also has
plans to build four new pipelines before 2007, adding
1,600 miles of new pipe in order to better integrate the
national gas distribution system and make it easier to
deliver gas supplies to consumers throughout the
country.
In addition to the domestic expansion of its natural gas
pipeline system, Indonesia is planning to increase its
export capabilities. PGN has begun work on a 400-mile
pipeline that would connect Sumatra with Singapore
[95]. State-owned oil and gas company Pertamina
expects to start delivering Sumatran natural gas to Singapore beginning in early 2005. Indonesia already provides Singapore with natural gas from its Natuna Sea
field. There have also been discussions about constructing an ASEAN-wide natural gas pipeline system (which
may begin on a fairly small scale), linking major gas producers Malaysia and Indonesia to Singapore [96]. So far,
however, there are no concrete proposals in place to
implement the scheme.
Like Indonesia, Malaysia is endowed with substantial
proven natural gas reserves. As of January 1, 2003,
Malaysias reserves were estimated to be 75 trillion cubic
feet [97]. The country produced 1.5 trillion cubic feet of
gas in 2000, half of which it consumed for domestic markets and half for export. Also like Indonesia, Malaysia is
a major exporter of LNG. In 2001, Malaysia alone
accounted for 15 percent of the total world trade in LNG,
exporting to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are
currently some limited pipeline exports to Singapore as
well.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In the eighth Malaysia National Plan, the government
pledged to invest some $8.2 billion between 2001 and
2005 to develop the countrys natural gas reserves to
meet growing demand [98]. There are also efforts underway to enhance Malaysias domestic and international
gas distribution systems. A strong proponent of the proposed trans-ASEAN gas pipeline, Malaysia is working
to establish a gas link with Thailand that would bring
natural gas from the Malaysian-Thai Joint Development
Area in the Gulf of Thailand into Malaysia for the first 5
years of operation and after that into Thailand as well
[99]. The proposed pipeline has faced numerous delays
because of concerns from environmental groups and
local communities that would be affected. The project
still faces several legal and regulatory challenges before
construction can begin, but developers hope it can be
completed by the end of 2005.
Malaysia currently consumes about one-half of its total
natural gas production. More than three-quarters of the
gas consumed in Malaysia is for electricity generation,
but with industrial sector gas demand poised to increase
strongly over the projection period, that share is
expected to decline somewhat [100]. Malaysia is also
one of the few countries in a position to diversify its electricity fuel mix by increasing generating fuels other than
natural gas. The government is promoting the development of both coal-fired and hydroelectric capacity and is
introducing incentives to increase the use of wind, solar,
and mini-hydroelectricity. The electricity supplier
Tenaga Nasional Berhad has also begun to use a blend of
diesel fuel and palm oil at some electric power plants in
order to help the government support Malaysias palm
oil industry, as well as to improve its fuel diversity. All
these measures will lessen Malaysias reliance on natural gas in the power sector.
The company was forced to renegotiate the supply contract when the Thai currency collapsed in 2000, delaying
the commissioning of the Ratchaburi gas-fired power
plant.
Taiwan is another developing Asian country that has
seen strong growth in natural gas consumption over the
past decade, from 80 billion cubic feet in 1990 to 234 billion cubic feet in 2001. Much of the increment in natural
gas demand has been to fuel electricity generation. The
government has encouraged the development of
LNG-fired power plants, and as a result the power sector
now accounts for nearly three-fourths of total natural
gas consumption in Taiwan.
With fairly modest natural gas reserves, estimated as 2.7
trillion cubic feet in 2003, Taiwan has been importing
LNG since 1990 in order to meet demand [104]. LNG
supplies are currently provided by long-term contract
agreements with Indonesia and Malaysia. There are also
plans by Tuntex Gas Corporation to procure supplies
from Australias Northwest Shelf Gas Project to supply
its new regasification terminal in Taoyuan County [105].
Another potential source of LNG supplies for Taiwan
may come from Russias Sakhalin-2 project. Royal
Dutch/Shell announced in 2003 that it was hoping to
provide state-owned Taiwan Power with 1.7 million
metric tons of LNG per year for a 25-year period beginning in 2008, pending construction of an LNG receiving
terminal that is part of the tender [106]. Indonesias
Pertamina is competing with Royal Dutch/Shell for the
contract.
Middle East
Natural gas consumption in Thailand has tripled since
1990. Demand for natural gas increased even during the
Asian economic crisis of 1997-1998, when demand for
other fuels declined. The country has strongly expanded
the use of gas in its electric power sector, which presently accounts for most of Thailands demand, with the
rest consumed in the industrial sector [101].
Natural gas consumption in the Middle East rose
sharply in the 1990s, from 3.7 trillion cubic feet in 1990 to
7.9 trillion cubic feet in 2001 (Figure 53), and is expected
to increase to 13.9 trillion cubic feet in 2025, at an annual
average growth rate of 2.4 percent. Oil-exporting countries in the Middle East are seeking to expand natural
gas use domestically so that as much oil as possible can
be exported. Saudi Arabia, for one, has been trying to
spur natural gas development for the past several years
through its strategic gas initiative (see box on page 66).
Proven natural gas reserves have grown steadily in
Thailand with aggressive investment in the gas sector. In
1990, Thailand reported gas reserves of 6.9 trillion cubic
feet; as of January 1, 2003, reserves had grown to 13.3
trillion cubic feet [102]. As a result, the country can currently meet most of its demand with domestic resources,
but it is already securing imports of natural gas to meet
the rapidly expanding market. Thailand imports a modest amount of natural gas from Myanmar through the
Yadana-Ratchaburi pipeline, about 55 billion cubic feet
of the 192 billion cubic feet originally contracted for by
the state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand [103].
Middle East countries are also planning to expand natural gas exports from the region. Although natural gas
reserves in the Middle East are slightly higher than in
the EE/FSU (see Figure 44), gas production lags far
behind that of the EE/FSU region. In 2001, gas production in the Middle East totaled 8.3 trillion cubic feet, less
than one-third of EE/FSU production. In contrast to the
FSU, the Middle East has few pipelines. Nearly all natural gas exports from the Middle East are in the form of
LNG. Countries in the Middle East are planning to
increase LNG exports and also are exploring several
pipeline options to increase export capability.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Turkey recently announced plans for a pipeline connection to Greece. Although the current proposal is modest,
at 0.02 trillion cubic feet per year initially, it represents a
first step for pipeline natural gas from the Middle East to
reach the European pipeline network. The pipelines
overall capacity may be much higher, which would
allow for additional throughput should plans advance
for further connections to Europe via Italy or the Balkans
[107]. Turkeys state-owned gas company, Botas, has
also signed a separate agreement with the national gas
companies of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Austria
for a feasibility study on a gas pipeline that could bring
Caspian or Iranian gas through Turkey [108].
Turkey is eager to develop re-export options for natural
gas, having signed several contracts for natural gas
imports only to see demand growth fail to keep pace
with the contracted import volumes. Turkey recently
negotiated a more flexible delivery schedule with Iran.
Shipments will start at 0.07 trillion cubic feet in 2003 and
rise by 0.04 trillion cubic feet per year to a plateau of 0.4
trillion cubic feet per year around 2010. The original
schedule called for 0.1 trillion cubic feet per year in 2002
increasing to 0.4 trillion cubic feet per year by 2007. Russias Gazprom has also agreed to reduce natural gas
imports via the Blue Stream pipeline from 0.1 trillion
cubic feet to 0.07 trillion cubic feet in 2003. Turkey is also
scheduled to begin importing natural gas from
Azerbaijan in 2006 under an agreement that calls for 0.07
trillion cubic feet per year initially, rising to 0.2 trillion
cubic feet per year in 2009. The natural gas pipeline is to
be constructed jointly and in the same corridor as the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil export pipeline [109].

Iran has the second highest natural gas reserves in the
world behind Russia but did not begin exporting natural
gas until 2001. Exports were cut off for several months in
2002, when Turkey complained about poor gas quality.
Flows were restarted after negotiations reduced the
delivery schedule as noted above. Iran is not only interested in expanding natural gas exports through Turkey
to Eastern and Western Europe but has also discussed a
pipeline to India. The pipeline could be built overland
but would have to transverse Pakistan, which is very
difficult politically. An undersea pipeline could avoid
crossing Pakistan, but it would have to be built at depths
of up to 11,500 feet, much deeper than the 7,000-feet
depths reached by the Blue Stream line across the Black
Sea [110].
In addition to pipeline projects, Iran is also planning to
construct LNG facilities for exporting natural gas as part
of its massive South Pars development. Irans South Pars
Oil and Gas Company is seeking bids for phases 11 and
12, which involve LNG exports from a proposed 8 million metric ton plant at Assaluyeh on the Persian Gulf.
South Pars development has experienced some delays,
however. Phase 1, involving natural gas and condensate
production, is expected to come on stream around the
end of 2003. Phases 2 and 3 started producing 0.4 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas per year in March 2002. Phases 4
and 5 are stated to be back on track with some 28 percent
progress [111]. Iran is aiming to supply India with LNG
but will have to compete with several other producers in
what is currently a buyers market.
Qatar has been aggressively expanding its LNG facilities. Qatar has one of the largest gas fields in the world,
the North Field, situated near Irans South Pars field,
and is aiming to triple its LNG capacity to 45 million
metric tons per year by 2010. Qatar has long-term contracts with buyers in Spain, Japan, and South Korea, and
agreements are in place for future deliveries to India,
Italy, and the United Kingdom. Qatar has also sold spot
cargoes to the United States. In addition, Qatar has plans
to build gas-to-liquids plants and is expected to provide
the natural gas for the first long-distance pipeline project
in the Gulf area, the Dolphin project [112]. Dolphin
Energy is waiting to sign a crucial long-term sales contract with the emirate of Dubai, which is expected to
cover about one-half of the initial demand. The project is
expected to pump at least 0.7 trillion cubic feet per year
of Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates [113].
Natural gas requirements have been outstripping production in the United Arab Emirates, which has given
impetus to the Dolphin project. The vast majority of Abu
Dhabis gas reserves are associated and hence constrained by oil production. In addition, rising oil field
reinjection requirements and a surge in power demand
is pushing up the demand for natural gas. Dubai has also

The Saudi Gas Initiative
In the late 1990s, the government of Saudi Arabia was
facing budget deficits and declining revenues from oil
sales, the result of a combination of relatively low oil
prices and high domestic unemployment rates. The
government also recognized the need to increase electricity supplies in Saudi Arabias rapidly growing residential and industrial sectors. By one estimate, Saudi
Arabia will need at least $117 billion of investment in
the electricity sector alone to meet demand in the next
20 years.a In 1998, the Saudi crown prince held informal discussions with several international oil companies about possible investment in the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia. The attending companies were invited to submit proposals for exploration and development projects, primarily in the natural gas sector, as part of a
strategic gas initiative.
The Saudi Gas Initiative (SGI) has attracted considerable interest. Indeed, it amounts to the largest integrated gas development plan anywhere in the world.
Saudi government advocates of opening the upstream
sector to partnerships with foreign investors believe
that the SGI will lead international oil companies to
invest $25 billion in the near term and possibly further
direct investment of $50 billion or more over the next
25 years. Further, they estimate that every dollar
invested will generate $5 to $8 of investment in other
sectors of the Saudi economy,b and that every billion
dollars of investment by foreign oil companies will create 15,000 new jobs. The companies involved in SGI
apparently do not believe that the projects proposed
will achieve those goals,c arguing that natural gas
and oil development are capital-intensive, not laborintensive ventures and so cannot be used to solve Saudi
Arabias unemployment problem.
Although Saudi Arabia holds the fourth largest
reserves of natural gas in the world, at 224 trillion cubic
feet (of which 88 trillion cubic feet is nonassociated),
the country has been slow to develop its natural gas
resources. Saudi Arabias current natural gas production is around 5.3 billion cubic feet per day.d The government has estimated that domestic consumption
could increase by 12 to 14 billion cubic feet per day over
the next 20 years or so, assuming that necessary investment will be made to convert existing oil-powered
utilities to run on cheaper natural gas and to meet
future demand for new capacity with more efficient
gas-fired technologies.
The decision to open upstream natural gas development to foreign companies, as proposed in the SGI, has
not been universally popular in Saudi Arabia and is
particularly unpopular with the state-owned Saudi
Aramco, which for the past 30 years has held a monopoly on the development of hydrocarbons in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Aramco believes it has proved its technical
and managerial capabilities to explore and develop its
natural gas reserves without foreign intervention. In
2002, for example, the company successfully developed the Haradh and Hawiyah gas projects, including
the worlds largest plant for processing nonassociated
natural gas, as part of the Master Gas System (which
predated the SGI).
From the beginning, the companies that were invited
in 1998 to participate in the SGI had some difficulty
obtaining the detailed information they needed to
draw up proposals. In 2000, in an effort to speed up the
process, the Saudi government created a new body, the
Supreme Council for Petroleum and Mineral Affairs
(SCPMA), to review SGI proposals and increase cooperation between the various Saudi ministries involved.
The SCPMA was also given direct control over Saudi
Aramco, an important aspect of the new bodys
function.
The SCPMA has indicated a preference for integrated
natural gas projects that cover upstream nonassociated
gas exploration and development, gas processing and
transportation, and ethane and natural gas liquid
extraction and fractionation facilities, as well as downstream power, water desalination, and petrochemical
plants.e SCPMA has also stated clearly that Saudi
Aramco will play an active role as a partner in any deal
signed with foreign countries participating in the SGI.
Other Saudi government bodies, such as the Electricity
Authority, will also be involved, as will private Saudi
companies either directly or through related services.
The SGI consists of three core ventures (see map on following page):

reserves than Core Venture 1, the project will
involve the development of pipelines to Tabuk and
Yanbu, as well as construction of one power and
one desalination plant. The estimated cost of Core
Venture 2 is about $5 billion.
Core Venture 1, the South Ghawar Area Development, is located in the eastern part of the kingdom,
near the Persian Gulf. Natural gas would be produced from the southern part of the Ghawar oil
field (the largest oil field in the world), in the
Haradh and Hawiyah areas. Estimated gas reserves
on offer are about 21 trillion cubic feet.f This
venture also involves significant downstream elements, including two 2,000-megawatt power stations and desalination plants at Jubail and Yanbu
that can produce 300 million gallons of desalinated
water a day, and two petrochemical plants, one at
Jubail fueled with ethane and a second at Yanbu
fueled with mixed feedstocks, with a total capacity
of 2 million metric tons of petrochemical production per year. The expected cost of Core Venture 1 is
about $15 billion.
Core Venture 3, the Shaybah Area Development,
involves the development of the Kidan sour gas
field near Saudi Arabias eastern border with the
United Arab Emirates, in addition to the installation of treatment and transport facilities for associated gas extracted from the Shaybah oil field, with
potential reserves of 10 trillion cubic feet of gas and
a production capacity of 600 million cubic feet per
day. It includes the construction of a pipeline and
petrochemical plant, a 1,100-megawatt power
plant, and a desalination plant that can produce 75
million gallons of desalinated water a day, all to be
located on the Persian Gulf coast. The estimated
cost of Core Venture 3 is about $5 billion.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
The Saudi Gas Initiative (Continued)
were grouped into three consortia, and a timetable was
set to move forward. Later in January, Saudi Aramcos
data rooms in Dhahran were opened to the short-listed
firms. In May 2001 the composition and leadership of
the consortia for the three core ventures was
announced:
Core Venture 1: ExxonMobil (lead with 35 percent),
Shell (25 percent), BP Amoco (25 percent), Phillips
(15 percent)
Core Venture 2: ExxonMobil (lead with 60 percent),
Occidental and Enrong (40 percent split between
the two)
Core Venture 3: Shell (lead with 40 percent),
TotalFinaElf (30 percent), Conoco (30 percent).
The two leading companies in the three core ventures,
ExxonMobil and Shell, are familiar with the local market conditions in Saudi Arabia as a result of their
long-standing downstream joint venture projects dating back to the mid-1980s.
In June 2001in the rare presence of the ailing Saudi
king and the countrys crown prince and other key
officialsBP Amoco, Shell, ExxonMobil, Phillips,
TotalFinaElf, Marathon, Occidental, and Conoco
signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) for the
first foreign investment deals in the kingdom since
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil and gas sector in 1976.
Negotiations over details of the SGI have been slow
and contentious since the signing of the MOUs in 2001.
The Saudis were unable to reach an agreement with the
foreign oil companies on a range of important issues.
Final deadlines have come and gone with no agreement in the foreseeable future, leading to speculation
that all three of the core venture projects ultimately
may have to be re-tendered.
The issues of contention have ranged from determining tax terms and access to upstream gas reserves to
ownership of the gas liquid, the guaranteed rate of
return on investment, and tariffs on water and electricity. In their submissions, the international companies had assumed that a 30-percent tax rate would
apply under Saudi Arabias new laws on foreign
investment; however, Saudi Aramco, supported by the
tax authorities, sees gas development as subject to
petroleum tax laws dating back to the mid-1970s,
implying a 20-percent royalty before cost recovery and
an 85-percent tax on the remaining output.h
The leading companies in the three core ventures
stated that they had been led to believe that they would
be given direct access to some 74 trillion cubic feet of
nonassociated natural gas, whereas in fact the data
submitted by Saudi Aramco showed the gas reserves to
be far smaller than initially believed.i The downstream
aspects of the core ventures would become less profitable if insufficient access to gas reserves drove up the
cost of feedstocks bought from Saudi Aramco. The Saudis have indicated that extra acreage would be made
available if there were insufficient volumes of gas in
the areas assigned to the core ventures. On the liquid
ownership issue, the Saudis are adamant that any oil or
gas liquid developed from the scheme must be transferred to Saudi Aramco control.
Determining the guaranteed rate of return on capital
has been among the stickiest issues in the negotiations.
The foreign oil companies were seeking 18 to 20 percent as a guaranteed rate of return on their investments. The Saudis initially offered 10 to 12 percent, as
is the norm for similar projects in the Persian Gulf
region and in Europe,j but have recently revised the
offer to a guaranteed rate of return between 14.5 and
15.5 percent for the three core ventures. They have also
presented figures for the maximum prices per gallon of
water and per kilowatthour of electricity to be produced in the proposed SGI water and power projects.k
The new figures seem to be close to those desired by the
participating foreign companies.
The Saudi government has suggested that it might also
reduce the foreign companies commitment to power
and water projects, as they had been demanding,
because there is an urgent need to press ahead with
some of those projects. The Saudi government has been
approached by a number of companiesparticularly
in the power and water sectorsoffering their services
at a lower rate of return and willing to team up with
Saudi private investors, as was done by the first independent power producer in Saudi Arabia, a joint venture between a Saudi private investor (Al Zamil
Industrial Group) and a foreign service company (CMS
Energy) that was approved 2 years ago.l
gEnron, originally named as part of Core Venture 2, pulled out with no explanation and gave up its stake. Marathon was selected to
replace Enron.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
been receiving about 0.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
per year from Abu Dhabi since 2000 to meet soaring
power demand, a figure that is expected to grow. The
project is aiming for 2006 for the first gas deliveries [114].
Africa
Natural gas consumption in Africa is projected to
increase from 2.3 trillion cubic feet in 2001 to 5.3 trillion
cubic feet in 2025 (Figure 54), at an average annual
growth rate of 3.6 percent. Africa is a major exporter of
natural gas. In 2001, Africa accounted for about 12 percent of the natural gas traded in the world. More than 85
percent of Africas gas exports went to Western Europe.
Natural gas exports from Africa are expected to increase
through the forecast period, with Western Europe continuing to be the main recipient. Several pipeline and
LNG projects are aimed at supplying the rising demand
for natural gas in Europe.
Algeria is the second largest LNG producer in the world
and also has significant pipeline exports. Algeria is hoping to add a new 4 million metric ton LNG train as part
of the development of its Gassi Touil project, but the
inability to pass a new hydrocarbons law, a dispute with
European Union competition authorities over resale
restrictions, and stiff competition from a growing list of
LNG suppliers has slowed the process [115]. Algeria has
expressed interest in expanding sales of LNG to the
United States, which amounted to 0.06 trillion cubic feet
in 2001, as a means of diversifying its customer base.
Algerian Minister of Energy Chakib Khelil expressed
concern, however, that a U.S. regulatory requirement for
third-party access to any new receiving terminals may
impede construction of new import terminals [116].
In 2001, Algeria exported 0.8 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas via the Transmed (Enrico Mattei) pipeline through
Tunisia to Italy. Sonatrach, the Algerian state-owned
company, plans to boost the capacity of the line to 1.1
trillion cubic feet per year [117]. Algeria and Italy also
agreed in late 2002 to explore the feasibility of another
pipeline connection through Sardinia and Corsica. The
new pipeline is expected to add export capability of 0.3
to 0.4 trillion cubic feet per year and would probably
take 4 to 5 years to complete [118]. In addition, a feasibility study was done on a direct line from Algeria to Spain.
Each of the seven European partners in the Medgaz
pipeline project is understood to have signed or be close
to signing a letter of intent to purchase 0.04 trillion cubic
feet per year from the pipeline. Initial capacity is
planned at 0.3 trillion cubic feet per year, with the possibility of increasing it to 0.6 trillion cubic feet per year
[119]. Compressors are being added to the existing pipeline through Morocco to raise capacity to 0.5 trillion
cubic feet per year by 2004, from 0.3 trillion cubic feet per
year in 2002 [120].
Egyptian LNG (ELNG) is moving ahead with plans to
develop several trains at Idku. The entire output of the
first train has been sold to Gaz de France under a 20-year
agreement. The first train is already under construction,
and production is expected to begin in the third quarter
of 2005. The site can accommodate up to five trains, and
an innovative commercial structure allows third parties
to invest in future LNG production trains at the site. A
second train is in the planning stages [121].
Spanish utility Union Fenosa hopes to start deliveries
from its 5.0 million metric tons per year LNG train at
Damietta, Egypt, in 2004, just a few months before the
first output from the LNG facilities at Idku. Adequate
gas supply has been a concern, but a discovery by Italys
ENI in late December 2002 may help to alleviate those
concerns. A preliminary appraisal of the Tennin reserves
came in at 0.5 to 1.1 trillion cubic feet. ENI recently purchased 50 percent of the gas business of Union Fenosa
[122].
Libya is planning to expand its export capability by
building a pipeline from Melitah on the Libyan coast to
Gela in Sicily. With a capacity of 0.3 trillion cubic feet,
the pipeline is part of the development of the onshore
and offshore Wafa fields. It includes an offshore platform, gathering networks, and a gas treatment plant.
The first gas is set to flow in 2005 [123].
Nigerias natural gas reserves rank ninth in the world,
but in the past more than one-half of its production has
been flared due to lack of infrastructure. About 25 different gas projects are currently underway in Nigeria.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Some of the projects aim to reinject the gas, but others
intend to channel supplies to Nigerias expanding LNG
facilities. The current deadline to end flaring is 2008, and
Nigerian president Obasanjo has indicated a desire to
move the deadline forward to 2004 [124].
Nigeria began exporting LNG from its third train on
December 18, 2002, and signed a $1.06 billion loan on
December 19 that will provide some of the funding for
the fourth and fifth trains. Spains Gas Natural (GN) and
Portugals Transgas have contracted for the supply from
the third train [125]. Trains 4 and 5 are targeted for completion at the end of 2005. Nigeria LNG has four sales
agreements and two memoranda of understanding covering the output from trains 4 and 5, all with European
companies. Feedstock gas for the new trains is expected
to be 100 percent associated gas, with nonassociated gas
as a backup. The first two trains run up to 40 percent
associated gas. A final investment decision on train 6 is
expected in September 2003 [126].
Nigeria is also planning an export pipeline into Ghana,
Togo, and Benin. The presidents of the four countries
involved are expected to sign an intergovernmental
treaty providing a common legal framework for the line,
followed by the establishment of the West African Pipeline Company (Wapco). The project developers hope to
begin pumping gas in 2005, with initial flow rates of
about 0.07 trillion cubic feet per year [127]. Also under
consideration is a pipeline north from Nigeria to supply
natural gas to Niger and Mali, which could eventually
be linked to the pipeline network in North Africa and
provide pipeline gas to Europe [128].
Central and South America
Although natural gas markets in Central and South
America accounted for only 3.9 percent of the worlds
natural gas consumption in 2001, they are growing rapidly. Consumption in the region increased by 73 percent
between 1990 and 2001, and IEO2003 projects continuing growth of 5.2 percent per year over the forecast
period, to 11.7 trillion cubic feet by 2025 (Figure 55). Currently, except for LNG exported from Trinidad and
Tobago, all of Central and South Americas natural gas
production is consumed within the region, and indigenous production is sufficient to meet current demand.
Natural gas markets are still in the early stages of development in many Central and South American countries.
Exploration activities continue to yield promising discoveries, and reserves increased from 245 trillion cubic
feet at the end of 2000 to 253 trillion cubic feet at the end
of 2001 [129]. The highest concentrations of reserves are
in Argentina and Bolivia in the South and Venezuela
and Trinidad and Tobago in the north. Venezuelas 148
trillion cubic feet of reserves far surpasses those of any
other country in the region. The second highest concentration of reserves, 28 trillion cubic feet, is in Argentina.
Other countries holding notable reserves, in order of
amount, are Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.
Natural gas production in Central and South America as
a whole increased by 3.7 percent from 2000 to 2001, led
by production increases in Bolivia and Brazil of 21 and
13 percent, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago was the
only major producer that reported a decrease, with production declining by 0.5 percent. Consumption
increased throughout the region, led by Brazil with a
19.3-percent increase, Peru with a 7.1-percent increase,
and Chile with a 6.5-percent increase. The overall
growth of natural gas consumption in the region was 4.1
percent. The major trade movements were from Argentina to Chile and from Bolivia to Brazil, with Argentina
also exporting to Brazil and Uruguay. Central America
neither produced nor consumed any natural gas.
Although the regions natural gas markets have continued to grow overall, economic and political turmoil has
had an impact on energy markets. The Argentine economic crisis, which led to a 29-percent currency devaluation in January 2002, continues and, along with the
downward adjustment of salaries by both the government and private industry, has destroyed consumer
confidence and brought a halt to the almost steady
growth in consumption the country had experienced
over the past decade. Argentinas natural gas industry is
entirely in the hands of the private sector, but weakening domestic demand along with the struggling economy has made the private sector hesitant to invest
further until conditions stabilize. As a result, the governments plans to attract foreign investment in Argentinas
natural gas sector has slowed considerably [130].

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In Venezuela, a political strike, led by a coalition of
union and management workers at the state oil and gas
company PDVSA, began in early December 2002, protesting the Chavez governments interference in
PDVSAs operations. The strike has put the governments plans to develop its natural gas sector in jeopardy. While repercussions in the oil sector, which
accounts for 75 percent of Venezuelas exports, are much
more severe than in the natural gas sector, they will
delay plans for PDVSA to join a feasibility study on the
Mariscal Sucre LNG project and for the government to
restructure the natural gas sector and begin exploration
and production of nonassociated gas [131]. Venezuela
opened its downstream natural gas market to foreign
investment in May 1998 and opened the exploration and
development of nonassociated gas to foreign investment
in August 1999. The Chavez administrations goal is to
increase both production and consumption of natural
gas in the near term. Because of the current political turbulence, however, foreign investors have backed off,
and the governments plans to develop offshore gas
fields have ground to a halt [132].
Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has been experiencing some economic problems resulting from its
take-or-pay arrangements with the Bolivian state oil and
gas company, YPFB. Making up the difference between
contracted amounts and what has actually been taken is
expected to cost between $50 and $60 million. Petrobras
is also liable for payments for unused transport capacity
it has contracted for on the export pipeline. The transport capacity liability could soon become significantly
worse, because the transport capacity committed to by
Petrobras is set to increase by 50 percent in March 2003.
Bolivian producers and the Bolivian government are
also not happy with the situation. Under the terms of the
contract, producers must supply any undelivered volumes at the end of the contract in 2019; as a result, Bolivian producers are receiving money that cannot be
registered as profit for a future liability. The government
is unhappy with the fact that it is unable to tax payments
that the producers receive for unsold gas [133].
South Americas LNG market continues to grow. Venezuela has been trying for more than 20 years to enter the
LNG market. The Mariscal Sucre LNG project is the successor to the Cristobal Colon project that was begun in
1990 in the hope of building a liquefaction train and
exporting LNG beginning in 1997 but, like other Venezuelan LNG projects, was abandoned. The new Mariscal
Sucre project will be held by PDVSA (60 percent), Shell
(30 percent), and Mitsubishi (8 percent). The remaining 2
percent will be open to private investors in Venezuela.
Mariscal Sucre consists of the development of four offshore fields with proven reserves of 4 trillion cubic feet
and probable reserves of 10 trillion cubic feet and
subsequent construction of a liquefaction facility beginning in 2004. The governments goal is 1 billion cubic
feet per day, with 300 million cubic feet destined for
local markets and the remainder for export [134].
The Mariscal Sucre project will be in direct competition
with the Trinidad and Tobago liquefaction trains. Trinidad and Tobago has been exporting LNG since the first
train at Atlantic LNGs Point Fortin facility became operational in 1999. In 2001, 32 percent of Central and South
Americas exports were in the form of LNG from Trinidad and Tobago, with 72 percent going to the United
States, 16 percent to Puerto Rico, and the remaining 12
percent to Spain. Train 2 became operational in August
2002, and train 3 is under construction and expected to
become operational by the second quarter of 2003.
According to Atlantic LNG, the disposition of the output
of the train 2 and train 3 expansions is to be 62 percent to
the Spanish conventional and power markets and 38
percent to the U.S. market, primarily to the southeast
through the Elba Island terminal. A fourth train is currently under consideration, and public consultations
began in September 2002 to get feedback on the proposed additional train [135].
Bolivia is also attempting to enter the LNG market. In
December 2001, the Pacific LNG consortium entered
into a 20-year agreement with Sempra Energy for 800
million cubic feet per day of LNG to be exported from
Bolivia to North America to serve Mexican and U.S.
markets. The agreement called for the construction of a
two-train liquefaction facility on the Pacific coast of
South America. An extended debate has been going on
as to whether the facility will be built along the coast of
Peru or the coast of Chile. While the Chilean port seems
to be the most viable economically, historical hatred of
Chile by the Bolivians over land disputes has made
negotiations difficult. The governments reluctance to
make a decision, however, could jeopardize the project;
and rumors imply that the government is about to
announce the choice of the Chilean port of Patillos [136].

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Coal
Although coal use is expected to be displaced by natural gas in some parts of the world,
only a slight drop in its share of total energy consumption is projected by 2025.
Coal continues to dominate many national fuel markets in developing Asia.
World coal consumption has been in a period of generally slow growth since the late 1980s, a trend that is
projected to continue. Although total world consumption of coal in 2001, at 5.26 billion short tons,12 was
more than 27 percent higher than the total in 1980, it was
1 percent below the 1989 peak of 5.31 billion short
tons (Figure 56). The International Energy Outlook 2003
(IEO2003) reference case projects some growth in coal
use between 2001 and 2025, at an average annual rate of
1.5 percent (on a tonnage basis), but with considerable
variation among regions.
Coal use is expected to decline in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union (FSU).
Increases are expected in the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and developing Asia. In Western
Europe, coal consumption declined by 30 percent
between 1990 and 2001 (on a Btu basis), displaced in
large part by the growing use of natural gas and, in
France, nuclear power. A similar decline occurred in the
countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
(EE/FSU), where coal use fell by 40 percent between
1990 and 2001 as a result of the economic collapse that
followed the breakup of the Soviet Union, as well as
Figure 56. World Coal Consumption, 1970-2025
Billion Short Tons
some fuel switching. The projected slow growth in
world coal use suggests that coal will account for a
shrinking share of global primary energy consumption.
In 2001, coal provided 24 percent of world primary
energy consumption, down from 26 percent in 1990. In
the IEO2003 reference case, the coal share of total energy
consumption is projected to fall to 22 percent by 2025
(Figure 57).
The expected decline in coals share of energy use would
be even greater were it not for large increases in energy
use projected for developing Asia, where coal continues
to dominate many fuel markets, especially in China and
India. As very large countries in terms of both population and land mass, China and India are projected to
account for 28 percent of the worlds total increase in
energy consumption over the forecast period. The
expected increases in coal use in China and India from
2001 to 2025 account for 75 percent of the total expected
increase in coal use worldwide (on a Btu basis); however, coals share of energy use in China and India, and
in developing Asia as a whole, still is projected to decline
(Figure 58).

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Coal consumption is heavily concentrated in the electricity generation sector, and significant amounts are also
used for steel production. Almost 55 percent of the coal
consumed worldwide is used for electricity generation,
and power generation accounts for virtually all the projected growth in coal consumption worldwide [1].
Where coal is used in the industrial, residential, and
commercial sectors, other energy sourcesprimarily,
natural gasare expected to gain market share. One
exception is China, where coal continues to be the main
fuel in a rapidly growing industrial sector, reflecting the
countrys abundant coal reserves and limited access to
other sources of energy. Consumption of coking coal is
projected to decline slightly in most regions of the world
as a result of technological advances in steelmaking,
increasing output from electric arc furnaces, and continuing replacement of steel by other materials in end-use
applications.
The IEO2003 projections are based on current laws and
regulations and do not reflect the possible future ratification of proposed policies to address environmental
concerns. In particular, the forecast does not assume
compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, which currently is
not a legally binding agreement. The implementation of
plans and policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases could have a significant effect on coal consumption. For example, in an earlier study, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that the United
States could meet its Kyoto emissions target only by
reducing annual coal consumption by between 18 percent and 77 percent (on a Btu basis) by 2010, depending
on the level of international emission trading and
domestic offsets assumed [2].

Energy Markets (2003).
World coal consumption is projected to increase by
2.2 billion tons, from 5.3 billion tons in 2001 to 7.5 billion tons in 2025. Alternative assumptions about economic growth rates lead to forecasts of world coal
consumption in 2025 ranging from 5.9 to 8.8 billion
tons (see Figure 56).
Coal use in developing Asia alone is projected to
increase by 1.9 billion tons. China and India together
are projected to account for 28 percent of the total
increase in energy consumption worldwide between
2001 and 2025 and 75 percent of the worlds total projected increase in coal use, on a Btu basis.
Coal-fired generating capacity in China is projected
to increase by 60 percent, from 232 gigawatts in 2001
to 371 gigawatts in 2025. In India, coal-fired generating capacity is projected to increase by 45 percent,
from 66 gigawatts in 2001 to 96 gigawatts in 2025.
The share of coal in world total primary energy consumption is expected to decline from 24 percent in
2001 to 22 percent in 2025. The coal share of energy
consumed worldwide for electricity generation is
also projected to decline, from 34 percent in 2001 to
31 percent in 2025.
Environmental Issues
Highlights of the IEO2003 projections for coal are as
follows:
World coal trade is projected to increase from 650
million tons in 2001 to 826 million tons in 2025,
accounting for between 11 and 13 percent of total
world coal consumption over the period. Steam coal
(including coal for pulverized coal injection at blast
furnaces) accounts for most of the projected increase
in world trade.
Figure 58. Coal Share of Regional Energy
Consumption, 1970-2025
Developments in international coal markets are also
important to the coal outlook. World coal trade grew by
46 million tons between 2000 and 2001, increasing to 650
million tons. In 2002, international coal markets were
characterized by reduced growth in world coal trade relative to 2000 and 2001 and rising freight rates and coal
export prices during the latter part of the year.
Like other fossil fuels, coal has played an important role
in fueling the advancement of civilization, but its use
also raises environmental issues. Coal mining has a
direct impact on the environment, affecting land and
causing subsidence, as well as producing mine waste
that must be managed. Coal combustion produces several types of emissions that adversely affect the environment, particularly ground-level air quality. Concern for
the environment has in the past and will in the future
contribute to policies that affect the consumption of coal
and other fossil fuels. The main emissions from coal
combustion are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
(NOx), particulates, carbon dioxide (CO2), and mercury
(Hg).
Sulfur dioxide emissions have been linked to acid rain,
and many of the industrialized countries have instituted
policies or regulations to limit them. Developing countries are also increasingly adopting and enforcing limits
on sulfur dioxide emissions. Such policies typically
require electricity producers to switch to lower sulfur
fuels or invest in technologiesprimarily flue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipmentthat reduce the amounts
of sulfur dioxide emitted with coal combustion.
Environmental regulation influences interfuel competition (i.e., how coal competes with other fuels, such as oil
and natural gas), particularly in the power sector, where
the competition is greatest. For example, compliance
with increasingly stringent restrictions on emissions
could be increasingly costly and could lead to reduced
demand for coal. On the other hand, improved technologies may provide cost-effective ways to reduce
emissions from coal-fired power plants. Integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) technology, which may
soon be commercially competitive, can increase generating efficiencies by 20 to 30 percent and also reduce emission levels (especially of carbon dioxide and sulfur
oxides) more effectively than existing pollution control
technologies [3].
At the end of 1999, more than 280 gigawatts of coal-fired
capacity around the world were equipped with FGD or
other sulfur dioxide control technologies [4]. In the
United States, 95 gigawatts of coal-fired generating
capacity30 percent of the U.S. totalwas equipped
with technologies to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at
the end of 1999 [5]. In the developing countries of Asia,
only minor amounts of existing coal-fired capacity currently are equipped with desulfurization equipment.
For example, in China, the worlds largest emitter of sulfur dioxide, data for 1999 indicated that only about 2
percent of coal-fired generating capacity (at that time,
less than 4 gigawatts out of a total of 207 gigawatts) had
FGD equipment in place [6].
In addition to sulfur dioxide, increased restrictions on
emissions of nitrogen oxides, particulates, and carbon
dioxide are likely, especially in the industrialized countries. Although the potential magnitudes and costs of
additional environmental restrictions for coal are uncertain, it seems likely that coal-fired generation worldwide
will face steeper environmental cost penalties than will
new natural-gas-fired generating plants. For nuclear
and hydropower, which compete with coal for baseload
power generation, the future is unclear. Proposals have
been put forth in several of the developed countries to
partially or fully phase out nuclear capacity. Countries
where actual commitments have been made include
Germany, Lithuania, and Sweden. In other countries, it
has become difficult to site new capacity because of
unfavorable public reaction. The siting of new large
hydroelectric dams is also becoming more difficult
because of increased environmental scrutiny. In addition, suitable sites for new large hydropower projects in
the industrialized countries are limited [7].
By far the most significant issue for coal is emissions of
carbon dioxide. On a Btu basis, the combustion of coal
produces more carbon dioxide than the combustion of
natural gas or of most petroleum products (combustion
of petroleum coke produces slightly more carbon dioxide per unit of heat input than does combustion of coal).
Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy obtained
from coal are nearly 80 percent higher than those from
natural gas and approximately 20 percent higher than
those from residual fuel oil, which is the petroleum
product most widely used for electricity generation [8].
In 2001, the United States and China were the worlds
dominant coal consumers and also the two top emitters
of carbon dioxide, accounting for 24 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of the worlds total emissions. Different economic growth rates and shifting fuel mixes
explain in part why the U.S. share of world carbon emissions is projected in the IEO2003 forecast to decline to 22
percent by 2025, while Chinas share is projected to
increase to 18 percent (Figure 59). Worldwide, coal is
projected to continue as the second largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (after petroleum), accounting for
34 percent of the world total in 2025.

Total recoverable reserves of coal around the world are
estimated at 1,083 billion tons13enough to last approximately 210 years at current consumption levels (Figure
60). Although coal deposits are widely distributed, 60
percent of the worlds recoverable reserves are located
in three regions: the United States (25 percent), FSU (23
percent), and China (12 percent). Another four countriesAustralia, India, Germany, and South Africa
account for an additional 29 percent. In 2001, these seven
regions accounted for 80 percent of total world coal production [9].
Quality and geological characteristics of coal deposits
are other important parameters for coal reserves. Coal is
a much more heterogeneous source of energy than is oil
or natural gas, and its quality varies significantly from
one region to the next and even within an individual
coal seam. For example, Australia, the United States, and
Canada are endowed with substantial reserves of premium-grade bituminous coals that can be used to manufacture coke. Together, these three countries supplied 84
percent of the coking coal traded worldwide in 2001 (see
Table 19 on page 89).
At the other end of the spectrum are reserves of low-Btu
lignite or brown coal. Coal of this type is not traded to
any significant extent in world markets, because of its
relatively low heat content (which raises transportation
costs on a Btu basis) and other problems related to transport and storage. In 2001, lignite accounted for 18 percent of total world coal production (on a tonnage basis)
Figure 60. World Recoverable Coal Reserves
[10]. The top three producers were Germany (193 million tons), Russia (110 million tons), and the United
States (84 million tons), which as a group accounted for
41 percent of the worlds total lignite production in 2001.
On a Btu basis, lignite deposits show considerable variation. Estimates by the International Energy Agency for
coal produced in 1999 show that the average heat content of lignite from major producers in countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) varied from a low of 4.7 million Btu per
ton in Greece to a high of 12.3 million Btu per ton in Canada [11]. In comparison, premium coal supplied to
United States coke plants is estimated to have a content
of 27.4 million Btu per ton [12].
Regional Consumption
Developing Asia
The countries of developing Asia accounted for 40 percent of the worlds coal consumption in 2001. Primarily
as a result of substantial growth in coal consumption in
China and India over the forecast period, developing
Asia, taken as a whole, is projected to account for a
53-percent share of total world coal consumption by
2025.
The large increases in coal consumption projected for
China and India (Figure 61) are based on an outlook for
strong economic growth (6.2 percent per year in China
and 5.2 percent per year in India between 2001 and 2025)
and the expectation that much of the increased demand
for energy will be met by coal, particularly in the

industrial and electricity sectors. The IEO2003 forecast
assumes no significant changes in environmental policies in the two countries. It also assumes that necessary
investments in the countries mines, transportation,
industrial facilities, and power plants will be made.
In China, 62 percent of the coal demand in 2001 occurred
in the non-electricity sectors, for steam and direct heat
for industrial applications (primarily in the chemical,
cement, and pulp and paper industries), and for the
manufacture of coal coke for input to the steelmaking
process. Although China's coal demand in the nonelectricity sectors is expected to increase by 12 quadrillion Btu over the forecast period, the non-electricity
share of total coal demand is projected to decline to 52
percent by 2025. In 2000, China was the worlds leading
producer of both steel and pig iron [13].
Coal remains the primary source of energy in Chinas
industrial sector, primarily because China has limited
reserves of oil and natural gas. In the non-electricity sectors, most of the projected increase in oil use comes from
rising demand for energy for transportation. Growth in
the consumption of natural gas is expected to come primarily from increased use for space heating in the residential and commercial sectors.
With a substantial portion of the increase in Chinas
demand for both oil and natural gas projected to be met
by imports, the government recently has signed an
agreement with Hydrocarbon Technologies, Inc., to
build a direct coal liquefaction plant in China beginning
in 2003, with an expected startup in 2005. The $2 billion
facility will be located in Inner Mongolia and will have
an ultimate capacity of 50,000 barrels per day produced
from local coal. The agreement is for three units, which
together will consume 5 million tons of coal annually
[14]. Compared with South Africas most recently
constructed coal liquefaction plant (built by SASOL at
Secunda, South Africa, in 1982), which is capable of producing more than 25 million barrels of coal liquids annually, Chinas first plant will be smaller, with an annual
production capacity of approximately 18 million barrels.
In Chinas electricity sector, coal use is projected to grow
by 4.2 percent a year, from 9.8 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to
26 quadrillion Btu in 2025. In comparison, coal consumption by electricity generators in the United States is
projected to rise by 1.2 percent annually, from 20.9 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 27.7 quadrillion Btu in 2025. One
of the key implications of the substantial rise in coal use
for electricity generation in China is that large financial
investments in new coal-fired power plants and in the
associated transmission and distribution systems will be
needed. The projected growth in coal demand implies
that China will need to build approximately 140 gigawatts of additional coal-fired capacity by 2025.14 At the
beginning of 2001, China had 232 gigawatts of coal-fired
generating capacity [15].
The debate as to whether China will become a major coal
exporter (because of its relatively inexpensive mining
costs) or a major coal importer (because of anticipated
growth in its coal use over time) has yet to be determined. In either case, however, the completion of two
major non-coal infrastructure projects near the end of
the decade should reduce domestic coal demand and
free up more production for export. The first infrastructure improvement, a new west-to-east transmission line
that will allow hydropower from the Three Gorges Dam
complex to be wheeled to load centers in eastern and
southern China, will in all probability result in the displacement of coal-fired generation at small older plants.
The second infrastructure improvement, a new pipeline
that will bring natural gas from northwest China to eastern and southern provinces, will likely displace coal
used in industrial boilers and some utility generation
[16].
In India, projected growth in coal demand occurs primarily in the electricity sector, which currently accounts
for almost three-quarters of Indias total coal consumption. Coal use for electricity generation in India is projected to rise by 2.1 percent per year, from 4.1 quadrillion
Btu in 2001 to 6.7 quadrillion Btu in 2025, implying
that India will need to build approximately 30 gigawatts
of additional coal-fired capacity.15 At the beginning
of 2001, Indias total coal-fired generating capacity
amounted to 66 gigawatts [17].
Indias state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is the largest thermal power generating
company in India. At present, it has 16,220 megawatts of
coal-fired capacity that rely almost exclusively on
Indias state-owned coal producer, Coal India Limited
(CIL), for its supply of coal. Later in this decade, however, demand from the power sector is expected to outstrip CILs production target level, with the result that
NTPC and the other utilities in India will begin supplementing domestic coal supplies with additional shipments from the international market [18].
14 Based on the assumption that, on average, coal consumption at Chinas fleet of coal-fired power plants will rise to a level of 70 trillion
Btu per gigawatt by 2025. Higher average utilization rates (or capacity factors) for coal plants, taken as a whole, would increase the amount
of coal consumed per unit of generating capacity, while overall improvements in conversion efficiencies would have the opposite effect. In
EIAs Annual Energy Outlook 2003 reference case forecast, U.S. coal-fired power plants are projected to consume an average of 73 trillion Btu
of coal per gigawatt of generating capacity in 2025, based on a projected average utilization rate of 83 percent and an average conversion efficiency of 33.5 percent.
15 Based on the assumption that, on average, coal consumption at Indias coal-fired power plants will rise to a level of 70 trillion Btu per
gigawatt by 2025. See previous footnote for discussion of the factors that affect the amount of coal consumed per unit of generating capacity.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In the remaining areas of developing Asia, a considerably smaller rise in coal consumption is projected over
the forecast period, based on expectations for growth in
coal-fired electricity generation in South Korea, Taiwan,
and the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (primarily Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). In the electricity
sector, coal use in the other developing countries of Asia
(including South Korea) is projected to increase by 0.3
percent per year, from 2.2 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 2.4
quadrillion Btu in 2025.
The key motivation for increasing use of coal in other
developing Asia is diversity of fuel supply for electricity
generation [19]. This objective exists even in countries
that have abundant reserves of natural gas, such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In the
IEO2003 forecast, coals share of fuel consumption for
electricity generation in the region is projected to decline
from 22 percent in 2001 to 13 percent by 2025.
Some of the planned additions of coal-fired generating
capacity in other developing Asia for 2003 and later
include 5,400 megawatts of new coal-fired capacity for
South Korea by 2015, 4,900 megawatts for Malaysia by
2006, and 1,400 megawatts for Thailand by 2009 [20]. In
addition to planned capacity additions, a number of new
coal-fired units have come on line in the region between
1999 and 2002, adding a combined total of more than
15,000 megawatts of electric power supply in South
Korea (4,600 megawatts), Taiwan (4,215 megawatts),
Indonesia (2,450 megawatts), Malaysia (1,700 megawatts), and the Philippines (2,040 megawatts) [21]. In
Indonesia, however, several large coal-fired plants that
have been completed recently or are near completion
(Paiton I, Paiton II and Tanjung Jati-B) await new transmission capacity, which will not be fully completed until
2005 [22].
Because of environmental concerns and abundant natural gas reserves, there is considerable opposition to the
addition of coal-fired capacity in Southeast Asia, particularly for countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. A
number of individuals and environmental groups argue
that reliance on local supplies of natural gas for electricity generation is a wiser and probably a more economical choice than constructing new coal-fired power plants
that will rely on imported fuel and produce more pollution than gas-fired plants [23]. Recently, the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) decided to
delay purchasing power from three coal-fired plants for
3 years. This decision will delay the startup of a
1,364-megawatt project constructed by BLCP Power (a
consortium of energy companies) until 2009 and may
also significantly affect the development of the Bo Nok
and Hin Krut plants, both of which have faced heavy
opposition from local residents and environmental
groups [24].
Industrialized Asia
Industrialized Asia consists of Australia, New Zealand,
and Japan. Australia is the worlds leading coal exporter
and Japan is the leading coal importer in the world. In
2001, Australian coal producers shipped 214 million
tons of coal to international consumers, and another 144
million tons of Australian coal (both hard coal and lignite) was consumed domestically, primarily for electricity generation. Coal-fired power plants accounted for 77
percent of Australias total electricity generation in 2001
[25]. Over the forecast horizon, coal use in Australia is
expected to increase slightly. At present, Australias
Queensland district has three new coal-fired power projects in various stages of completion: Callide C power
plant (840 megawatts of capacity brought on line in
2001), Millmerran plant (840 megawatts of capacity
brought online in 2002), and Tarong Power plant (450
megawatts scheduled for early 2003) [26]. In addition,
Australias Griffin Group plans to construct a
350-megawatt coal-fired plant near the existing Collie A
power plant in Western Australia [27].
Japan, which is the third largest coal user in Asia and the
seventh largest globally, imports nearly all the coal it
consumes, much of it originating from Australia [28].
Japans last two underground coal mines, Ikeshima with
an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tons and
Taiheiyo with a capacity of 2.2 million tons, were closed
in late 2001 and early 2002 [29]. Currently, slightly more
than one-half of the coal consumed in Japan is used by
the countrys steel industry (Japan is the worlds second
largest producer of both crude steel and pig iron) [30].
Coal is also used heavily in the Japanese power sector,
and coal-fired plants currently generate approximately
25 percent of the countrys electricity supply [31]. Japanese power companies plan to construct an additional 16
gigawatts of new coal-fired generating capacity between
2001 and 2010 [32].
Western Europe
In Western Europe, environmental concerns play an
important role in the competition among coal, natural
gas, and nuclear power. Recently, other fuelsparticularly, natural gashave been gaining economic advantage over coal. Coal consumption in Western Europe has
fallen by 36 percent since 1990, from 894 million tons to
574 million tons in 2001. The decline was smaller on a
Btu basis, at 30 percent, reflecting the fact that much of it
resulted from reduced consumption of low-Btu lignite
in Germany.
Over the forecast period, coal consumption in Western
Europe is projected to decline by an additional 22 percent (on a Btu basis), reflecting a slower rate of decline
than was seen during the previous decade. Factors
contributing to further cutbacks in coal consumption include continued penetration of natural gas for
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
electricity generation, environmental concerns, and continuing pressure on member countries of the European
Union to reduce subsidies that support domestic production of hard coal.
The European Commission has proposed that a new
state aid scheme for coal be established to allow for the
continuation of subsidies for hard coal production in
member states through December 31, 2010 [33]. In
essence, the Commission wants to establish measures
that will promote the development of renewable energy
sources as well as maintain a minimum capacity of subsidized coal production in the European Union for the
purpose of establishing an indigenous primary energy
base. Under this new scheme, the guiding principle for
coal will be that subsidized production will be limited to
that which is strictly necessary for enhancing the security of energy supply (i.e., to maintain access to coal
reserves, keep equipment in an operational state, preserve the professional qualifications of a nucleus of coal
miners, and safeguard technological expertise).
The recent trend in the consumption of hard coal16 in
Western Europe is closely correlated with the trend in
the production of hard coal, primarily because coal
imports have increased by much less than production
has declined (Figure 62). Following the closure of the last
remaining coal mines in Belgium in 1992 and Portugal in
1994, only four member states of the European Union
(the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and France)

continue to produce hard coal [34], and all have seen
their output of hard coal decline since 1990. In the near
future, the proposed enlargement of the European
Union would add two additional producers of hard coal,
Poland and the Czech Republic [35].
Hard coal production in the United Kingdom decreased
from 104 million tons in 1990 to 35 million tons in 2001, a
decline of 69 million tons [36]. During the same period,
coal consumption fell by 48 million tons. Most of the
decline in coal consumption resulted from privatization
in the electricity sector, which led to a rapid increase in
natural-gas-fired generation at the expense of coal.
The massive switch to natural gas and its adverse impact
on the countrys coal industry prompted the British government, in mid-1998, to place a moratorium on the construction of new gas-fired plants and, at the same time,
request that a study be completed to assess the state of
the countrys electric power industry [37]. The two key
issues to be investigated were the design, operation, and
structure of the countrys wholesale electricity market
and the diversity and security of fuel supplies for electricity generation. As a result of the study, revisions in
the setup of the countrys wholesale electricity market
were introduced, primarily aimed at introducing competition into the market for electricity generation.
The revised electricity market, referred to as the New
Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA), went into
effect on March 27, 2001, and the moratorium on the construction of new gas-fired generating plants was lifted in
November 2000 [38]. As of early 2003, NETA has been
successful to the extent that the United Kingdom has
realized substantial declines in both wholesale and retail
electricity prices [39]. Under the countrys former electricity market, referred to as the Electricity Pool, wholesale electricity prices failed to fall despite an estimated
50-percent decline in generation costs between 1990 and
2000. On the other hand, coal-fired generators have
faired somewhat poorly under NETA, with lower cost
generation effectively forcing the mothballing of several
older coal-fired plants during 2002. Some UK generators
indicate that wholesale electricity prices have essentially
fallen to a level that is below the cost of production,
while others argue that NETA has allowed the market to
work and that what is occurring now is simply a weeding out of the most inefficient, high-cost electricity
plants [40]. (For further discussion on NETA, see pages
149-151 in the Electricity chapter.)
Currently, the United Kingdoms remaining coal mines
are by far the most productive hard coal operations in
Western Europe. Substantial improvements in the countrys mining operations in recent years have led to an
16 Internationally, the term hard coal is used to describe anthracite and bituminous coal. In data published by the International Energy
Agency, coal of subbituminous rank is classified as hard coal for some countries and as brown coal (with lignite) for others.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
increase in average labor productivity from 1,190 tons
per miner-year in 1990 to 3,200 tons per miner-year in
1999 [41]. Despite this achievement, the price of coal
from domestic mines is essentially at parity with the
price of coal imports, and it is likely that production
from domestic mines will continue to be sensitive to
changes in international coal prices [42]. In fact, following several years of sharp declines in international coal
prices in 1998 and 2000, the UK government reinstated
coal production subsidies for 2000 through 2002 in an
effort to protect the countrys remaining coal operations
(Table 18) [43].
In Germany, Spain, and France, subsidies continue to
support the domestic production of hard coal,17 even
though there is no hope that their production will ever
be competitive with imports. The European Commission authorized coal industry subsidies for 2001 of
$4,643 million in Germany, $1,194 million in Spain, and
$1,073 million in France [44]. In each of the three countries, the average subsidy per ton of coal produced
exceeds the average value of imported coal (Table 18),
and all three are currently taking steps to reduce subsidy
payments, acknowledging that some losses in coal production are inevitable.
Germanys hard coal production declined from 86 million tons in 1990 to 32 million tons in 2001 [45]. In late
1999, the Supervisory Board of RAG Aktiengesellschaftan international mining and technology group
based in Essen, Germanyagreed to speed up the pace
of restructuring, because declining prices for hard coal
in the world market and the severe drop in coal demand
for steel production resulted in additional costs for the
company beyond those covered by the existing subsidy
granted by the German government. The revised restructuring agreement calls for an additional reduction
in Germanys coal production to 26 million tons by 2005,
to be achieved by further mergers. The net result of all
planned mergers: a capacity reduction of 8.2 million tons
and the loss of over 10,000 jobs [46]. The closure of three
coal mines in 2000 (with a combined production capacity of approximately 6.7 million tons) leaves Germany
with only 10 remaining hard coal mines in operation
[47].
Between 1990 and 2001, German lignite production
declined by 234 million tons, primarily as a result of
massive substitution of natural gas for both lignite and
lignite-based town gas18 in the eastern states following reunification in 1990 [48]. The collapse of industrial
output in the eastern states during the same period was
a contributing factor. In the IEO2003 reference case, Germanys coal consumption is projected to remain steady
until 2005, after which it begins falling again, although
not as dramatically as in recent years. By 2025, coal use
in Germany is projected to be 203 million tons, a drop of
62 million tons from the 2001 level of 265 million tons.
In Spain, hard coal production declined from 22 million
tons in 1990 to 16 million tons in 2001 [49]. Spain has
adopted a restructuring plan for 1998 through 2005 that
provides for a gradual decline in production to 12 million tons [50]. In addition to hard coal, two lignite mines
in Spain, which produced 9 million tons in 2001, are earmarked for closure within the next 3 to 4 years [51]. Currently, the two generating plants that burn the lignite
produced by the mines also rely in part on imports of
subbituminous coal. Both plants are expected to increase
their take of imported coal over the forecast, as lignite
production from the two mines is ramped down.
In France, production of hard coal declined from 12
million tons in 1990 to 2 million tons in 2001 [52]. A
modernization, rationalization, and restructuring plan
submitted by the French government to the European
Commission at the end of 1994 foresees the closure of
all coal mines in France by 2005 [53]. The coal industry

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
restructuring plan was based on a Coal Agreement
between Frances state-run coal company, Charbonnages de France, and the coal trade unions.
Coal use in other major coal-consuming countries in
Western Europe is projected either to decline or to
remain close to current levels. In the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), environmental concerns and competition from natural gas
are expected to reduce coal use over the forecast period.
The government of Denmark has stated that its goal is to
eliminate coal-fired generation by 2030 [54]. In 2001, 47
percent of Denmarks electricity was supplied by
coal-fired plants [55]. Coal consumption in Italy is projected to decline from 22 million tons in 2001 to 18 million tons in 2025 in the IEO2003 forecast, although an
increase of 3 to 5 million tons per year is possible if Enel,
Italys dominant electricity company, completes its plan
to boost coal use to 20 percent of its power generation by
2005-2006, by switching high-cost oil plants to lower cost
coal plants [56].
Partially offsetting the expected declines in coal consumption elsewhere in Europe is a projected increase in
consumption of indigenous lignite for power generation
in Greece. Under an agreement reached by the countries
of the European Union in June 1998, Greece committed
to capping its emissions of greenhouse gases by 2010 at
25 percent above their 1990 levela target that is much
less severe than the emissions target for the European
Union as a whole, which caps emissions at 8 percent
below 1990 levels by 2010 [57].
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
In the EE/FSU countries, the process of economic
reform continues as the transition to a market-oriented
economy replaces centrally planned economic systems.
The dislocations associated with institutional changes in
the region have contributed substantially to declines in
both coal production and consumption. Coal consumption in the EE/FSU region has fallen by 548 million tons
since 1990, to 828 million tons in 2001. In the future, total
energy consumption in the EE/FSU is expected to rise,
primarily as the result of increasing production and consumption of natural gas. In the IEO2003 reference case,
coals share of total EE/FSU energy consumption is projected to decline from 23 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in
2025, and the natural gas share is projected to increase
from 45 percent in 2001 to 57 percent in 2025.
The three main coal-producing countries of the FSU
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstanare facing similar
problems. The three countries have developed national
programs for restructuring and privatizing their coal
industries, but they have been struggling with related
technical and social problems. Between 1990 and 2001,
coal production declined by 72 million tons (19 percent)
in Russia, by 79 million tons (47 percent) in Ukraine, and
by 42 million tons (32 percent) in Kazakhstan [58].
Although both Kazakhstan and Russia have shown considerable progress in terms of closing uneconomical
mining operations and selling government-run mining
operations to the private sector, Ukraine has made considerably less progress in its restructuring efforts. In
Kazakhstan, many high-cost underground coal mines
have been closed, and its more competitive surface
mines have been purchased by, and are now operated
by, international energy companies [59]. In Russia, the
World Bank estimates that 77 percent of the countrys
coal production in 2001 will originate from mines not
owned by the government, and that percentage was
expected to increase to more than 90 percent by the end
of 2002 [60].
In Ukraine, a coal restructuring program initiated by the
government in 1996, with advice and financial support
provided by the World Bank, has been mostly unsuccessful in rejuvenating the industry. Key problems that
continue to plague the Ukrainian coal industry are that:
(1) most of the countrys mines continue to be highly
subsidized, government-run enterprises; (2) dangerous
working conditions prevail (several catastrophic mine
disasters have occurred in the past several years); (3)
wage arrears continue to be a serious problem, with
miners currently owed back wages of approximately
$3.5 billion; (4) productivity is very low due to antiquated mining equipment and the extreme depths at
which coal is extracted (only three of Ukraines active
coal mines are surface operations); and (5) nonpayment
for coal by customers is rampant [61].
The World Bank has focused its efforts in Ukraine on trying to convince the government that it needs to close
additional unprofitable mines [62]. In 2001, a spokesperson for the World Bank expressed his belief that an additional 50 to 60 of the countrys remaining coal mines
need to be closed [63]. Others indicate that problems
with the Ukrainian coal industry will not be solved simply through the closure of the least economical mines.
They point to delays in privatization of coal mining
operations, widespread corruption and abuse in the coal
sector, worsening geological conditions, and misdirection of government subsidies (e.g., not enough of the
government subsidies have been directed toward equipment upgrades at existing mines). Most recently, the
Ukrainian government indicated that it would not formally present a plan to privatize the coal industry until
after 2003 [64].
Recent data showing a slight resurgence in coal production in the FSU since 1998, particularly in Russia and
Kazakhstan, in combination with draft energy strategies
for Russia and Ukraine, indicate an optimistic long-term
outlook for both coal production and consumption [65].
The IEO2003 outlook for FSU coal consumption, however, is for an increase until 2005 and then a declining
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In Eastern Europe, Poland is the largest producer and
consumer of coal; in fact, it is the second largest coal producer and consumer in all of Europe, outranked only by
Germany [66]. In 2001, coal consumption in Poland
totaled 151 million tons, 47 percent of Eastern Europes
total coal consumption for the year [67]. Polands hard
coal industry produced 113 million tons in 2001, and lignite producers contributed an additional 66 million tons.
Coal consumption in other Eastern European countries
is dominated by the use of low-Btu subbituminous coal
and lignite produced from local reserves. The region,
taken as a whole, relies heavily on local production, with
seaborne imports of coal to the region summing to a little
more than 3 million short tons in 2000 [68].
million tons, accounting for 92 percent of the regional
total. By 2025 U.S. consumption is projected to rise to
1,444 million tons. The United States has substantial
supplies of coal reserves and has come to rely heavily on
coal for electricity generation, a trend that continues in
the forecast. Coal provided 51 percent of total U.S. electricity generation in 2001 and is projected to provide 47
percent in 2025 [73]. To a large extent, EIAs projections
of declines in both minemouth coal prices and coal
transportation rates are the basis for the expectation that
coal will continue to compete as a fuel for U.S. power
generation. Increases in coal-fired generation are projected to result from both greater utilization of U.S.
coal-fired generating capacity and the addition of 65
gigawatts of new coal-fired power plants by 2025. Over
the forecast period, the average utilization rate of
coal-fired generating capacity is projected to rise from 69
percent in 2001 to 83 percent by 2025.
Polands hard coal industry operated at a slight loss in
2001, but it is expected to operate in the black in 2002
[69]. Over the past several years, a number of coal industry restructuring plans have been put forth for the purpose of transforming Polands hard coal industry to a
position of positive earnings, eliminating the need for
government subsidies. The most recent plan for
Polands final phase of coal industry reorganization was
announced in November 2002. Under the 3-year plan,
employment would be reduced to 100,000 workers by
2006, and seven coal mines would be scheduled for closure. That would leave Poland with 31 mines capable of
producing 87 million tons of coal per year, eliminating
the traditional surplus (3 million tons in 2002) along
with a large portion of the heavily state-subsidized coal
export business, which receives more than $10 for each
ton of coal exported [70]. The 13 trade unions involved in
Polands coal industry are opposed to the proposed final
phase, however, and now the Polish government has
agreed to defer its decision on pit closures and to maintain the coal miners traditional social benefits [71].
In Canada, coal consumption accounted for approximately 14 percent of total energy consumption in 2001
and is projected to decline slightly over the forecast
period. In the near term, the restart of six of Canadas
nuclear generating units (four at Ontario Powers
Pickering A plant and two at Bruce Powers Bruce A
plant) over the next few years is expected to restrain the
need for coal in eastern Canada. A committee of the provincial legislature on alternative fuel sources recently
recommended that Ontario eliminate all coal-fired generation within the next 13 years. The Ontario government appeared to support this proposal by vetoing the
sale of Ontario Powers Thunder Bay and Antikokan
coal facilities in Northern Ontario, which now account
for 25 percent of the Provinces electricity output, and
hinting that they could be mothballed after 2015 [74].
The leader of Ontarios Liberal Party has been even more
aggressive, pledging to replace all coal-fired power with
natural gas and renewable energy within 5 years if his
party wins the next election, scheduled to be held in late
2003 or early 2004 [75].
The Polish government projects that sales of hard coal
from domestic mines will decline from 100 million tons
in 1998 to 77 million tons by 2025. As of August 2001, the
World Bank had approved a total of $400 million in hard
coal sector adjustment loans in support of the Polish
governments restructuring program. The most recent
loan, in the amount of $100 million (referred to as the
Second Hard Coal Sector Adjustment Loan, or SECAL 2)
was designed to support the implementation of the
Polish governments Revised Hard Coal Sector Reform
Program. It will support capacity and financial restructuring, environmental improvements, privatization,
and social monitoring [72].
In western Canada, increased demand for electricity is
expected to result in the need for some additional
coal-fired generation [76]. Canadas lead exporter of
metallurgical grade coal, Fording, is currently in the process of building two 500-megawatt coal-fired generation
units in the Province of Alberta, approximately 110
miles southeast of Calgary [77]. The first unit is expected
to be on line at the end of 2005 and the second in 2006.
Additional coal-fired capacity in Alberta is being added
by TransAlta at its Keephills coal facility (900 megawatts), scheduled for operation in 2005, and by a joint
EPCOR-TransAlta investment in EPCORs Genesee
Phase 3 project (450 megawatts), scheduled for operation in winter 2004-2005 [78]. In Saskatchewan,
SaskPower is currently rebuilding its coal-fired Boundary Dam Unit 6 at Estevan, extending its life by an additional 20 to 25 years. The rebuild, which will include a
trend over time. Natural gas and oil are expected to fuel
most of the projected increase in energy consumption
for the region.
North America
Coal use in North America is dominated by U.S.
consumption. In 2001, the United States consumed 1,060
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
new scrubber system to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions,
should be complete by July 1, 2003 [79].
Mexico consumed 15 million tons of coal in 2001. Two
coal-fired generating plants, Rio Escondido and Carbon
II, operated by the state-owned utility Comision Federal
de Electricidad (CFE), consume approximately 10 million tons of coal annually, most of which originates from
domestic mines [80]. In addition, CFE has recently
switched its six-unit, 2,100-megawatt Petacalco plant,
located on the Pacific coast, from oil to coal. The utility
estimates that the plant will require more than 5 million
tons of imported coal annually. Late in 2002, CFE
awarded a contract for 2.5 million tons to a supplier of
Australian coal after encountering problems with a Chinese coal supplier [81]. A coal import facility adjacent to
the plant, with an annual throughput capacity of more
than 9 million tons, serves both the power plant and a
nearby integrated steel mill [82].
Although natural gas is expected to fuel most new generating capacity to be built in Mexico over the IEO2003
forecast period, some new coal-fired generation is also
expected. Several manufacturing companies, such as
Kimberly Clark and steelmakers Ispat and Altos Hornos
de Mexico, are exploring the possibility of constructing
some coal-fired plants near their production facilities
[83]. The plants would be developed under Mexicos
new self-supply provisions, which allow private power
producers and large industrials the option of bypassing
state-owned CFE as long as the industrial end users hold
equity stakes in the projects [84]. In addition, based on
authorization granted by the governments energy
authority in 2001, the CFE is considering the possibility
of constructing a new coal-fired plant on Mexicos
Pacific coast [85].
Africa
Africas coal production and consumption are concentrated heavily in South Africa. In 2001, South Africa produced 250 million tons of coal, representing 97 percent
of Africas total coal production for the year. Approximately three-quarters of South Africas coal production
went to domestic markets and the remainder to exports
[86]. Ranked third in the world in coal exports since the
mid-1980s (behind Australia and the United States),
South Africa moved up a notch in 1999 when its exports
exceeded those from the United States, then slipped
back to third in 2001 when its export total was surpassed
by Chinas. South Africa is also the worlds largest producer of coal-based synthetic liquid fuels. In 1998, about
17 percent of the coal consumed in South Africa (on a Btu
basis) was used to produce coal-based synthetic oil,
which in turn accounted for more than one-fourth of all
liquid fuels consumed in South Africa [87].
For Africa as a whole, coal consumption is projected to
increase by 103 million tons between 2001 and 2025,
primarily to meet increased demand for electricity,
which is projected to increase at a rate of 3.0 percent per
year. Some of the increase in coal consumption is
expected outside South Africa, particularly as other
countries in the region seek to develop and use domestic
resources and more varied, less expensive sources of
energy.
The Ministry of Energy in Kenya has begun prospecting
for coal in promising basins in the hope of diversifying
the fuels available to the countrys power sector [88]. In
Nigeria, several initiatives to increase the use of coal for
electricity generation have been proposed, including the
possible rehabilitation of the Oji River and Markurdi
coal-fired power stations and tentative plans to construct a large new coal-fired power plant in southeastern
Nigeria [89]. Also, Tanzania may move ahead on plans
to construct a large coal-fired power plant. The new
plant would help to improve the reliability of the countrys power supply, which at present relies heavily on
hydroelectric generation, and would promote increased
use of the countrys indigenous coal supply [90].
A recently completed coal project in Africa was the commissioning of a fourth coal-fired unit at Moroccos Jorf
Lasfar plant in 2001. With a total generating capacity of
1,356 megawatts, the plant accounts for more than
one-half of Moroccos total electricity supply and is the
largest independent power project in Africa and the
Middle East [91].
Central and South America
Historically, coal has not been a major source of energy
in Central and South America. In 2001, coal accounted
for about 3.8 percent of the regions total energy consumption, and in years past its share has never exceeded
5 percent. In the electricity sector, hydroelectric power
has met much of the regions electricity demand, and
new power plants are now being built to use natural gas
produced in the region. Natural gas is expected to fuel
much of the projected increase in electricity generation
over the forecast period.
Brazil, with the ninth largest steel industry worldwide in
2001, accounted for more than 65 percent of the regions
coal demand (on a tonnage basis), with Colombia, Chile,
Argentina, and to a lesser extent Peru accounting for
much of the remainder [92]. The steel industry in Brazil
accounts for more than 75 percent of the countrys total
coal consumption, relying on imports of coking coal to
produce coke for use in blast furnaces [93].
In the forecast, Brazil accounts for most of the growth in
coal consumption projected for the region, with
increased use of coal expected for both steelmaking
(both coking coal and coal for pulverized coal injection)
and electricity production. With demand for electricity
approaching the capacity of Brazils hydroelectric
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
plants, the government recently introduced a program
aimed at increasing the share of fossil-fired electricity
generation in the country, primarily promoting the construction of new natural-gas-fired capacity. The plan
also includes several new coal-fired plants to be built
near domestic coal deposits [94]. In addition, serious
consideration is being given to the construction of a
large coal-fired power plant at the port of Sepetiba, to be
fueled by imported coal [95].
2001, world imports of coal amounted to 650 million
tons (Figure 63 and Table 19), representing 12 percent of
total consumption. By 2025, coal imports are projected to
rise to 826 million tons, accounting for an 11-percent
share of world coal consumption. Although coal trade
has made up a relatively constant share of world coal
consumption over time and should continue to do so in
future years, the geographical composition of trade is
shifting.
In November 2002, the construction of Puerto Ricos first
coal-fired power plant was completed as part of a
long-range plan to reduce the countrys dependence on
oil for electricity generation [96]. The 454-megawatt circulating fluidized bed (CFB) plant, located in Guayama,
will require approximately 1.5 million tons of imported
coal annually [97].
In recent years, international coal trade has been characterized by relatively stable demand for coal imports in
Western Europe and expanding demand in Asia (see
Figure 62). Rising production costs in the indigenous
coal industries of Western Europe, combined with continuing pressure to reduce industry subsidies, have led
to substantial declines in production there, creating the
potential for significant increases in coal imports; however, environmental concerns and increased electricity
generation from natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower
have curtailed the growth in coal imports. Conversely,
growth in coal demand in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in recent years has contributed to a substantial rise
in Asias coal imports.
Middle East
Turkey accounts for almost 86 percent of the coal consumed in the Middle East. In 2001, Turkish coal consumption reached 81 million tons, most of it low-Btu,
locally produced lignite (approximately 6.8 million Btu
per ton) [98]. Over the forecast period, coal consumption
in Turkey (both lignite and hard coal) is projected to
increase by 40 million tons, primarily to fuel additional
coal-fired generating capacity. Projects currently in
the construction phase include a 1,210-megawatt hardcoal-fired plant being built on the southern coast of Turkey near Iskenderun, to be fueled by imported coal, and
a 1,440-megawatt lignite-fired plant (Afsin-Elbistan B
plant) being built in the lignite-rich Afsin-Elbistan
region in southern Turkey [99]. When completed
between 2003 and 2005, the two plants could add
more than 10 million tons to Turkeys annual coal
consumption.
Israel, which consumed 11 million tons of coal in 2001,
accounts for most of the remaining coal use in the Middle East. In the near term, Israels coal consumption is
projected to rise by approximately 3 million tons per
year following the completion of two 575-megawatt
coal-fired units at Israel Electric Corporations Rutenberg plant in 2000 and 2001 [100]. Israel obtains most of
its coal from South Africa, Australia, and Colombia and
has, in the past, also obtained coal from the United
States. Recently approved plans for an additional 1,200
megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity near the
Rutenberg site in 2007 should result in another increase
in consumption of approximately 3 million tons of coal
per year [101].
Trade
Overview
The amount of coal traded in international markets is
small in comparison with total world consumption. In
Most recently, in 2001 and 2002, international coal markets have undergone some significant changes on both
the supply and demand sides. In 2001, international coal
markets were affected by several factors, including a
sharp decline in ocean freight rates from 2000, further

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
recovery in coal export prices (FOB port of exit) from
lows reached in 1999 and early 2000, a continuation of
strong growth in coal import demand, and a continuing
surge in coal exports from China [102].
World coal trade increased by 7.7 percent in 2001, compared with increases of 10.0 percent in 2000 and 0.4 percent in 1999. All the major demand regions (Europe,
Asia and the Americas) posted increases for the year. In
Europe, the overall increase in coal imports in 2001 was
largely the result of a 13-million-ton (52-percent)
increase in imports by the United Kingdom. In the
Americas, a 7-million-ton (58-percent) increase in
imports by the United States boosted the overall total for
the region [103].
Increased imports of coal to the United Kingdom in 2001
were attributable to a combination of strong growth in
electricity demand during the year, high natural gas
prices, and limited availability of domestic coal supply
[104]. In the United States the record-breaking level of
coal imports was due to both heightened demand for
low-sulfur coal by U.S. electricity producers to meet sulfur emission requirements and a tight domestic coal
supply market for most of the year [105].
On the transportation side, ocean freight rates declined
substantially in 2001, despite strong growth in international coal trade. Declining freight rates were attributable in part to a displacement of medium coal export
hauls in the Asian market, originating from countries
such as Australia and South Africa, with considerably
shorter hauls out of China and Indonesia [106].
Relative to 2001, the year 2002 was marked by a much
smaller gain in world coal trade (increasing by less than
2 percent), a continuation of low ocean freight rates
through the first half of the year, and declining coal
export prices through much of the year [107]. During the
latter half of 2002, however, both freight rates and coal
export prices were on the rise. Higher freight rates
toward the end of 2002 were attributable primarily to
increasing international demand for iron ore and coal,
and higher coal export prices were primarily due to
increasing coal import demand. A continuation of favorable exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continued to
benefit several key exporting countries, including Australia, South Africa, and Russia [108].19
Between 1998 and 2001 coal exports from China expanded by a remarkable 178 percent, from 36 million
tons in 1998 to 100 million tons in 2001. Preliminary data
indicate that China exported 97 million tons of coal
during 2002, maintaining its position as the second
leading coal export country in the world, ahead of South
Africa and Indonesia [109]. The United States, which
was the second largest coal exporter in the world from
1984 through 1998, was surpassed by South Africa and
Indonesia in 1999 and by China in 2000.
Recent actions by the Chinese government to encourage
coal exports include an increase in coal export rebates
and a reduction in the export handling fees charged by
Chinas four official coal export agencies [110]. A recent
forecast from the Chinese government places coal
exports at 132 million tons by 2005 [111].
Asia
Despite setbacks that resulted from the regions financial crisis in 1998, Asias demand for imported coal
remains poised for additional increases over the forecast
period, based on strong growth in electricity demand in
the region. Continuing the recent historical trend, Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan are projected to account for
much of the regional growth in coal imports over the
forecast period.
Japan continues to be the worlds leading importer of
coal and is projected to account for 24 percent of total
world imports in 2025, slightly less than its 2001 share of
26 percent [112]. Although playing a less dominant role
than in the past, Japanese industries, primarily steel
mills and electric utilities, continue to exert considerable
influence in the Asian coal market via their annual price
negotiations with major coal export suppliers (see box
on page 91). Declining gradually over time, Japans
share of total Asian coal imports has fallen from 85 percent in 1980 to 60 percent in 1990 and to 48 percent in
2001.
In 2001, Japan produced slightly less than 4 million tons
of coal for domestic consumption and imported 171 million tons [113]. The closure of Japans last two underground mines, Ikeshima and Taiheiyo, in late 2001 and
early 2002 leaves virtually all of Japans coal requirements to be met by imports [114].
China and India, which import relatively small quantities of coal at present, are expected to account for a significant portion of the remaining increase in Asian
imports. Imports by China and India have the potential
to be even higher than projected, but it is assumed in the
forecast that domestic coal will be given first priority in
meeting the large projected increase (1.8 billion tons) in
coal demand. In addition, coal imports by Malaysia and
the Philippines are also projected to rise substantially
over the forecast period, primarily to satisfy demand at
new coal-fired power plants. Diversification of fuel

Japanese Benchmark Coal Prices and the Asian Coal Market
As the worlds leading importer of coal, Japan has been
influential in the international coal market. Historically, contract negotiations between Japans steel
mills and coking coal suppliers in Australia and Canada established a benchmark price for coal that was
used later in the year as the basis for setting contract
prices for steam coal used at Japanese utilities.a Other
Asian markets also tended to follow the Japanese price
in settling contracts.
Japans influence has declined somewhat over the past
several years, however, and the benchmark pricing
system that was so influential in setting contract prices
for Japans steel mills was revised substantially in 1996.
The revisions reflected a move away from a system
which, in effect, averaged coal prices (with minor
adjustments for quality) to a regime with a broad spectrum of prices, where high-quality coking coals
received a substantial premium relative to lower quality coals.b
Changes have also occurred in the annual price negotiations between Japanese electric utilities and Australian steam coal suppliers. Traditionally, Japanese
utilities have met most of their coal requirements
through the use of long-term contracts that are subject
to annual price reviews. Annual negotiations to adjust
the price, quantity, and quality components of
long-term coal contracts with foreign suppliers
evolved during the oil price shocks of the 1970s and
remain a key feature of this market.c The Japanese
power utilities would approach the Australian suppliers as a single entity, with one or two individual utilities appointed by the others as the lead or champion
negotiators. The annual negotiations established what
was referred to as a benchmark or reference price
for Australian thermal coal (see figure), a price that was
more or less accepted by all the individual Japanese
utilities and Australian coal suppliers and served as
the basis for setting contract prices in other Asian countries.d
While a reference contract price continues to be
negotiated and widely noted in industry news and
publications, several factors have contributed toward a
recent decline in the share of total Australian imports
by Japans electric companies that is priced at this level.
One key factor has been a trend by Japanese electric
utilities to satisfy increasing amounts of their annual
coal requirements with spot-market purchases. Rising
from approximately 5 percent of total coal purchases in
1995, spot purchases of coal by Japanese electric utilities have grown considerably in recent years, accounting for an estimated 30-percent share of total import
requirements in 2001.e
A second factor contributing to the reduced importance of the reference price for thermal coal has been
the ongoing liberalization of the Japanese electricity
market. In essence, increasing competition is placing
cost-cutting pressure on Japans electricity producers,
making each individual utility less inclined to accept a

supply for electricity generation is the key factor underlying plans for additional coal-fired generating capacity
in these countries. In Thailand, strong environmental
opposition to coal has appeared to have prevailed over
the desire for diversification of fuel supply leading to the
governments cancellation of two large coal-fired generation projects [115]. This leaves only one planned coal
plant for Thailand, the 1,364-megawatt Rayong plant
being built by BLCP Power (a consortium of energy
companies), which is scheduled to come on-line in late
2006 [116].
During the 1980s, Australia became the leading coal
exporter in the world, primarily by meeting increased
demand for steam coal in Asia. Considerable growth in
exports of coking coal also occurred, however, as
Japanese Benchmark Coal Prices and the Asian Coal Market (Continued)
price negotiated by one of the other utilities. As a
result, Japanese power utilities have largely discontinued collective negotiations in favor of individual bargaining with suppliers and increasing reliance on
spot-market purchases.f
A third factor contributing to the reduced importance
of Japans reference coal price in Asia, and to an
overall reduction in electricity fuel costs as well, is an
increasing ability or willingness by plants in the region
to purchase a wider range of coals, reducing their
dependence on any one specific supply region or
mine.g This trend not only is the result of newer power
plants being technically capable of burning a wider
range of coals than older plants in the region but also is
attributable to a greater flexibility in fuel procurement
by operators of older plants. Industry experts point to
South Koreas stock of relatively modern plants as a
key factor underlying that countrys increasing use of
Chinese coals, whose higher calcium content, for
example, can cause problems at older coal plants.h Japanese utilities, however, continue to adhere to somewhat stricter coal quality requirements than other
Asian utilities, citing factors such as their countrys
extreme focus on reliability of electricity supply and
slagging and fouling problems encountered at some
Japanese plants in the past with the use of certain types
of Chinese coal.i
The shift to more competitive coal markets in Asia
implies that coal producers in Australia and other
exporting countries will be under increased pressure to
reduce mining costs in order to maintain current rates
of return. It also means that more distant suppliers,
such as the United States and Canada, will find it
increasingly difficult to increase or maintain export
sales to the region.
On the supply side, however, there has been a movement toward increasing consolidation, with several
coal-producing companies garnering an increasing
share of total world export capacity. Industry consolidation has the potential to give coal export suppliers
greater pricing power, based on their ability to control
the quantity of coal available for export, which, in turn,
diminishes to some extent the ability of coal importers
to negotiate lower prices. During 2001, nearly 40 percent of international steam coal shipments originated
from mines owned by just four companies: Anglo
American, Glencore/Xstrata, BHP Billiton, and Rio
Tinto.j By major exporting country in 2001, those four
companies, taken as a whole, controlled an estimated
70, 60, and 45 percent of the steam coal exports originating from South Africa, Colombia, and Australia,
respectively.
The ability of a group of major coal export suppliers to
exert significant control over international export
prices remains to be seen. Factors working against such
an outcome are that coal resources are plentiful and
widely distributed throughout the world, and only a
small proportion of the worlds total annual production is traded.k Thus, while short-term increases in coal
export prices are plausible as a result of limited supply,
in the medium to long term the capability to expand
existing mines and to bring new low-cost mines on line
in the worlds major coal-exporting countries, combined with continuing improvements in coal mining
productivity, should continue to exert downward
pressure on coal export prices.

countries such as Japan began using some of Australias
semi-soft or weak coking coals in their coke oven blends.
As a result, imports of hard coking coals from other
countries, including the United States, were displaced.
Australias share of total world coal trade, which
increased from 17 percent in 1980 to 33 percent in 2001, is
projected to increase slightly over the forecast period,
reaching 35 percent by 2025 [117]. Australia should continue as the major exporter to Asia, with its share of the
regions total coal import demand projected to remain at
or near its current level of 46 percent (Figure 64).
Recently, coal from China has been displacing some
Australian tonnage in several of Asias major coalimporting countries, such as South Korea, Japan, and
Taiwan [118]. Factors contributing to Chinas expanding
coal export position in Asia include: (1) the recent completion of projects and further commitments by the Chinese government to improve rail links to ports and to
construct new coal export facilities; (2) continuing support for Chinas coal export industry through state
subsidies; (3) aggressive pricing of coal exports, emphasizing market share rather than profits; and (4) the
relatively short transport distances from Chinas coalexporting ports to Asias major coal-importing countries, ensuring low shipping costs [119]. Over the forecast period, China is expected to increase slightly its
share of the regions overall coal import market.
The United States, once a major supplier of coal to Asia,
is currently only a minor participant the Asian market.
As shown in Figure 64, the U.S. share of total coal
imports by Asia has declined from 28 percent in 1980 to
less than 1 percent in 2001. An additional setback in U.S.
coal exports to this region occurred during 2002 as
Figure 64. Foreign Supplier Shares of Asian Coal
Imports, 1980-2025
Alaskas Usibelli coal mine was unable to renegotiate a
long-term sales contract with Korea East-West Power
Company, Ltd [120] (formerly part of the Korea Electric
Power Company). Beginning with shipments in 1984,
the Usibelli mine typically exported between 700,000
and 800,000 tons of subbituminous coal annually to
South Korea for use at the Honam coal-fired power station [121]. Usibelli Coal has since submitted a new contract proposal to Korea East-West Power Company and
is looking at other potential markets for its product, such
as coal plants that may eventually be built on the west
coasts of the United States or Mexico [122].
Europe, Middle East, and Africa
Coal imports to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
taken as a whole are projected to fall by approximately 2
percent over the forecast period (Figure 65). Projected
declines in overall imports to the countries of Western
Europe are offset by small increases projected for Turkey, Romania, Morocco, and Israel.
In Western Europe, strong environmental lobbies and
competition from natural gas are expected gradually to
reduce the reliance on steam coal for electricity generation, and further improvements in the steelmaking process will continue to reduce the amount of coal required
for steel production. Strict environmental standards are
expected to result in the closure of some of Western
Europes older coke batteries, increasing import requirements for coal coke but reducing imports of coking coal.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Projected reductions in indigenous coal production in
the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and France are
not expected to be replaced by equivalent volumes of
coal imports. Rather, increased use of natural gas,
renewable energy, and nuclear power (primarily in
France) is expected to fill much of the gap in energy supply left by the continuing declines in the regions indigenous coal production.
In 2001, the leading suppliers of imported coal to Europe
were South Africa (29 percent), Australia (19 percent),
South America (13 percent), and the United States (10
percent). Over the forecast period, low-cost coal from
South America (primarily from Colombia and Venezuela) is projected to meet an increasing share of European coal import demand, displacing some coal from
such higher cost suppliers as the United States and
Poland.
Despite expected gains in South Americas foothold in
Europe, South Africa is projected to maintain its position
as the leading supplier of coal to Europe. Currently,
plans call for an 11-million-ton expansion in South
Africas Richards Bay Coal Terminal, increasing the
facilitys annual throughput capacity to 90 million tons
[123]. The estimated completion date for this project is
sometime in 2005.
The Americas
Compared with European and Asian coal markets,
imports of coal to North and South America are relatively small, amounting to only 66 million tons in 2001
(see Table 19). Canada imported 36 percent of the 2001
total, followed by the United States (30 percent) and
Brazil (25 percent) [124]. Most (77 percent) of the imports
to Brazil were coking coal, and a majority of the remaining import tonnage was steam coal used for pulverized
coal injection at steel mills [125].
Over the IEO2003 forecast period, coal imports to the
Americas are projected to increase by 18 million tons,
with most of the additional tonnage going to Mexico, the
United States, and Brazil. Coal imports to the United
States are projected to increase from 20 million tons in
2001 to 28 million tons by 2025 [126]. Coal-fired power
plants located along the eastern seaboard and in the
southeastern part of the country are expected to take
most of the additional import tonnage projected over
the forecast period, primarily as a substitute for higher
priced coal from domestic producers. Brazil and Mexico
are projected to import additional quantities of coal for
both electricity generation and steelmaking.
Partly offsetting the projected growth in coal imports
elsewhere in the Americas, Canadian imports are
expected to decline over the next few years as six nuclear
generating units at the Pickering and Bruce plants gradually are returned to service [127]. While generation
from some of these units is crucial for averting expected
near-term shortages in the Provinces electricity supply
[128], the return to service of all six units over the next
few years should ultimately displace some of the generation from Ontarios coal-fired power plants. Coal
plants in Nova Scotia, however, are expected to increase
their take of imports after the closure of Canadas Phalen
and Prince underground mines in 2000 and 2001 [129].
During 2000, Nova Scotia Power purchased 0.8 million
tons of domestic coal (primarily from the Prince mine)
and 2.3 million tons of imports [130].
Coking Coal
Historically, coking coal has dominated world coal
trade, but its share has steadily declined, from 55 percent
in 1980 to 32 percent in 2001 [131]. In the forecast, its
share of world coal trade continues to shrink, to 27 percent by 2025. In absolute terms, despite a projected
decline in imports by the industrialized countries, the
total world trade in coking coal is projected to increase
slightly over the forecast period as a result of increased
demand for steel in the developing countries. Increased
imports of coking coal are projected for South Korea,
Taiwan, India, Brazil, and Mexico, where expansions in
blast-furnace-based steel production are expected.
Factors that contribute to the decline in coking coal
imports in the industrialized countries are continuing
increases in steel production from electric arc furnaces
(which do not use coal coke as an input) and technological improvements at blast furnaces, including greater
use of pulverized coal injection equipment and higher
average injection rates per ton of hot metal produced.
Each ton of pulverized coal (categorized as steam coal)
used in steel production displaces approximately one
ton of coking coal [132].20 In 2000, the direct use of pulverized coal at blast furnaces accounted for 16 percent
and 14 percent of the coal consumed for steelmaking in
the European Union and Japan, respectively [133].
20 Approximately 1.4 tons of coking coal are required to produce 1 ton of coal coke. However, according to information provided by the
World Coal Institute, each ton of coal injected to the blast furnace through pulverized coal injection (PCI) equipment displaces only about
0.6 to 0.7 tons of coal coke. As a result, each ton of PCI coal displaces approximately 1 ton of coking coal. Steel companies are able to reduce
their operating costs, however, because coal used for pulverized coal injection is typically less expensive than the higher quality coals
required for the manufacture of coal coke.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Nuclear Power
Nuclear power is projected to represent a shrinking share of the worlds
electricity consumption from 2001 through 2025, despite a net increase in
world nuclear capacity as a result of new construction and life extensions.
In the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference case, the nuclear share of the worlds total electricity supply is projected to fall from 19 percent in 2001 to
12 percent by 2025. The reference case assumes that the
currently prevailing trend away from nuclear power in
the industrialized countries will not be reversed, and
that retirements of existing plants as they reach the end
of their designed operating lifetimes will not be balanced by the construction of new nuclear power capacity in those countries. In contrast, rapid growth in
nuclear power capacity is projected for some countries
in the developing world.
At the end of 2002 there were 441 nuclear power reactors
in operation around the world (Figure 67). Another 33
nuclear power plants were under construction (Figure
68). Six new nuclear power plants began operation in
2002four in China and one each in South Korea and
the Czech Republic [1].
For the most part, and under most economic assumptions, nuclear power is a relatively expensive option for
electricity generation when compared with natural gas
or coal, particularly for nations with access to inexpensive sources of coal and natural gas. In addition, there is
strong public sentiment against nuclear power in many
parts of the world, based on concerns about plant safety,
radioactive waste disposal, and the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. The economics of nuclear power may
be more favorable in other countries where for new
nuclear construction capital costs can be relatively low,
discount rates low, and construction times potentially
short, and where other energy fuels (mostly imported)
are relatively expensive.
Figure 66. Nuclear Shares of National Electricity
Generation, 2001
Nineteen countries depended on nuclear power for at
least 20 percent of their electricity generation in 2001
(Figure 66). In absolute terms the worlds total nuclear
power capacity is projected to increase from 353 gigawatts in 2001 to 366 gigawatts in 2025 in the reference
case (Table 20). Most nuclear capacity additions are
expected to be in Asia, where China, India, Japan, and
South Korea are projected to add a combined total of
approximately 45 gigawatts of nuclear capacity between
2001 and 2025, while the rest of the world sheds some 32
gigawatts of existing capacity. In addition, life extensions, higher capacity factors, and capacity uprates are
expected to offset some of the capacity lost through
plant retirements in other parts of the world. Life extension and higher capacity factors will play a major role in
sustaining the U.S. nuclear industry throughout the
forecast period. Russia also has an ambitious life extension program. Thus, despite a declining share of global
electricity production, nuclear power is projected to continue in its role as an important source of electric power.
Nuclear power projections are subject to considerable
uncertainty, both economic and political. The IEO2003
high and low nuclear growth cases illustrate a range of
possible outcomes, based on more optimistic and more
pessimistic assumptions than in the reference case. On

the optimistic side, for example, emerging technologies
could change the economics and perceived safety of
nuclear power plants, as well as public sentiment about
radioactive waste disposal and nuclear weapons proliferation. In the high nuclear growth case, world nuclear
capacity is projected to grow from 353 gigawatts in 2001
to 567 gigawatts in 2025 (Table 20).
On the pessimistic side, whatever public support for
nuclear power is currently in evidence could be eroded
quickly if a serious nuclear mishap occurred anywhere
in the world; expected technology breakthroughs might
not materialize; and future delays or cost overruns on
nuclear power construction projects could adversely
affect economics. In fact, there have been no new orders
for nuclear power plants since 1978 in the United States
and none since 1993 in the European member countries
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). Nuclear power development
generally depends on government support or sanction,
and political developments can bring into power political parties that are opposed to the nuclear option, as has
happened in Western Europe in recent years. In the low
nuclear growth case, world nuclear capacity is projected
to shrink from 353 gigawatts in 2001 to 253 gigawatts in
2025 (Table 20). The low nuclear growth case does, however, include new builds in other regions, specifically
Asia. The following paragraphs discuss in more detail
some of the uncertainties that could affect the future of
nuclear power around the world.
The nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the United
States in 1979 and at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in
1986 did serious damage to nuclear prospects during the
1980s and 1990s. More recently, however, significant
improvements in operating and safety performance
have improved the image of nuclear power and its
future global prospects. For instance, the average world
nuclear power plant availability factor has improved
from 73 percent in 1990 to 83 percent in 2001 [2], and
average U.S. capacity factors have improved from 71
percent in 1992 to 89 percent in 2001 [3]. Greater capacity
utilization has allowed the U.S. nuclear power industry
to increase its net generation by 19 percent between 1991
and 2001,21 despite a nearly 2-percent decrease in operable nuclear capacity over the same period [4]. At the
same time, both overseas and in the United States, safety
measures have shown considerable improvement.
Nuclear power has also become a more desirable option
from the perspective of meeting the carbon dioxide
emission reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol.
Nowhere is the decision to build nuclear power capacity
left entirely to corporations or utilities that would base
their decisions solely on economic grounds. In general,

government policy (with an eye to public opinion)
guides the development of nuclear power. National policies have evolved considerably since the first nuclear
power reactors were connected to the grid in the United
Kingdom, United States, and Soviet Union during the
1950s. Shortly after the first oil crisis exposed the vulnerability of world economies to petroleum price shocks,
nations attempted to increase their access to more secure
sources of fuel, and subsequent oil price shocks tended
to reinforce their desires. As a result, many nations pursued nuclear power programs aggressively during the
1970s, in most cases with strong public support.
Subsequently, however, accidents at Three Mile Island
in the United States in 1979 and at Chernobyl in the
Soviet Union in 1986 pushed public opinion and
national energy policies away from nuclear power as a
source of electricity. In the United States, massive cost
overruns and repeated construction delaysboth
caused in large part by regulatory reactions to the accident at Three Mile Islandessentially ended U.S. construction of nuclear power plants. Similarly, both before
and after the Chernobyl accident, several European governments have announced their intentions to withdraw
from the nuclear power arena. Sweden committed to a
phaseout of nuclear power in 1980 after a national referendum. Both Italy and Austria have abandoned nuclear
power entirely, and Austria has also been a strong opponent of nuclear power programs in Eastern Europe that
it considers to be unsafe. Belgium, Germany, and the
Netherlands have committed to gradual phaseouts of
their nuclear power programs, although in some cases
such commitments have proven difficult to carry
through. Moreover, committed can be an ambiguous
term, given that political parties with different views on
nuclear power are periodically voted in or out of
national office.
In large part, government support for nuclear power has
waxed and waned with the changing of governing
regimes, depending on whether the nations ruling
party is liberal or conservative. In recent years public
officials and industry representatives from various
nations have called for a reevaluation of nuclear power.
For example, France, the Netherlands, Italy, and the
United States have recently elected conservative governments more favorably inclined to nuclear options. In
2001, the interim head of the Italian environmental protection agency stated that the country should review its
nuclear energy options and consider the potential
national benefits of new generation technologies [5]. In
the Netherlands, representatives of the ruling coalition
have proposed construction of a new plant [6]. In the
United States, the Bush Administrations energy plan
calls for the expansion of nuclear energy as a major
component of our national energy policy. Current U.S.
energy goals include an intended new build by the end
of the current decade. Further, the Bush Administration
budget proposal for 2003 included a provision to
increase spending on nuclear technology research to
$46.5 million from $12 million in 2002 [7].
In contrast, liberal governments in Sweden and Germany have committed both nations to the early retirement of their nuclear power sectors, and their recent
successes at the ballot box (in September 2002) may
lower the odds of reviving nuclear power programs in
both countries. Since June 2000, Germany has been committed to the shutdown of its nuclear power industry by
the mid-2020s, or after German reactors have been operational for an average of 32 years. Germanys current
Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schrder, with
the strong backing of political allies in the environmentalist Green Party, negotiated the terms of the nuclear
phaseout with Germanys electricity industry. It
remains unclear, however, whether the goals will be
met. Shortly after the September election, the German
nuclear supply industry showed some hesitancy about
meeting the agreed target date. In October, Energie
Baden Warttemberg AG (EnBW) applied for government permission to delay the scheduled closure of its
Obrigheim nuclear power station for 5 years [8]; and the
Chief Executive Officer of E.ON, Germanys second
largest electricity company, has called for the retention
of nuclear power [9].
If the closely decided German election in September
2002 had gone the other way, Germany might well have
reversed its commitment to a nuclear shutdown.
Schrders opponent, the Christian Democratic leader
Edmund Stoiber, and his Free Democrat allies had
adopted a platform that included a more accommodating view of nuclear power. A Stoiber government might
have delayed, tabled, or reversed the ambitious nuclear
shutdown plan. In Lithuania, not long after the previous
government had committed to a scheduled shutdown of
its existing nuclear power industry, the newly elected
president, who assumed office in February 2003, stated
that Lithuania must retain its nuclear power program
for definite [10].
Political and economic considerations clearly can affect
national plans for moving away from nuclear power.
For instance, Sweden is committed to closing down its
nuclear power industry entirely by the time the youngest of its nuclear power reactors reaches the end its
expected lifespanwhich was generally assumed to be
around the year 2010but the first two plant closures in
the nuclear phaseout plan were repeatedly delayed [11].
Barsebck 1, originally scheduled for shutdown in July
1998, continued operating until November 1999; and
Barsebck 2, originally scheduled for closure in 2001,
remains in operation. Only 2 months after the Swedish
elections in November 2002, two reports commissioned
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
by the government pointed to the difficulties that might
arise from closing Barsebck 2 on schedule [12]. In
March 2003, the Swedish government admitted that the
necessary conditions for closing Barsebck 2 (i.e., finding an alternative source of power) could not be met.
Swedens goal of phasing out its nuclear generation and
simultaneously attempting to meet its commitment to
greenhouse gas reductions following its ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol in March 2002 poses a particular
dilemma for this resource-intensive nation [13]. Energyintensive industries, such as forest products and iron
and steel, contribute a sizable sum to Swedens gross
domestic product (GDP) and exports, and it has been
estimated that 5 percent of the nations GDP could be
lost when nuclear power is phased out entirely. Combining a nuclear phaseout with climate change commitments could cost Sweden roughly one-third of its annual
GDP [14].
Another factor being weighed by European nations in
deciding whether to abandon, continue, or expand their
nuclear power programs is the influence of the multilateral European Union (EU). Although the EU does not set
the energy policies of its members, its voice can influence the debate. European Commission Vice President
(and also Transport and Energy Commissioner) Loyola
de Palacio has stated that it would be irresponsible for
countries to ignore nuclear power [15], and in mid-2002
the Commission published a report that called for keeping the nuclear option open [16].
The political divisions between pro- and anti-nuclear
advocates is particularly sharp in Taiwan. When the
Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan was elected to
power in March 2000, President Chen Shui-bian promised a phaseout of nuclear power and an emphasis on
liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a future source of electricity. Before the election, the Kuomintang (KMT) party
had ruled Taiwan since the fall of Nationalist China in
1949. A multi-party democracy emerged in Taiwan during the mid-1980s, along with a strong anti-nuclear
movement. In October 2000, in pursuit of his goal of
making Taiwan nuclear free, President Chen announced
a decision to cancel construction of the Lungmen nuclear
power station after the project had been one-third completed, which led to a major row with the more conservative parliament. Opposition parties, led by the KMT,
control the parliament and were strongly opposed to the
cancellation of Lungmen 1 and 2, viewing such a step as
unconstitutional. In February 2001, President Chen
reached an agreement with the parliamentary opposition to complete Lungmen but also to continue the pursuit of a non-nuclear Taiwan.
Finally, the on-again off-again history of Labor Party
support for a nuclear phaseout in the United Kingdom
suggests that opposing views on nuclear policy may
exist not only across parties but also within a single
party and, perhaps, within a single politician over time.
In 1986, the Labor Party voted to phase out the nations
nuclear power plants gradually over a period of decades
[17]. More recently, in 1997, its general election manifesto opposed adding to the countrys nuclear power
industry. Since the Labor Partys Prime Minister Tony
Blair came into office in 2001, however, several energy
policy statements from the government have suggested
that the Prime Ministers office may have significantly
softened its previous opposition to nuclear power. There
has even been speculation that the Blair government
could eventually come out in support of new builds.
Then, in January 2003, the government appeared to
reverse course again, when the allegedly pro-nuclear
energy policy minister, Brian Wilson, called for a 5-year
moratorium on construction of new nuclear power
capacity [18].
Regional Developments
Asia
In Asia, nuclear power plants are currently under construction in China, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and
Japan. In contrast to most of the rest of the world, developing Asia, in particular, still supports a buoyant
nuclear power plant construction industry. For the
developing countries of Asia (excluding Japan, which is
part of the industrialized Asia country grouping), the
IEO2003 reference case projects a 17-percent share of the
worlds total nuclear power capacity in 2025, up from 7
percent in 2001.
China
In 2001, China had only three nuclear power units in
operation: Guangdong 1 and 2 (944 megawatts each)
and Qinshan 1 (279 megawatts). Four new units were
opened in 2002, adding a total of 3,151 megawatts of
nuclear capacity: Lingao 1 and 2 (938 megawatts each),
Qinshan 2 unit 1 (610 megawatts), and Qinshan 3 unit 1
(665 megawatts). In the IEO2003 reference case, Chinas
nuclear capacity is projected to grow from 2,167 megawatts in 2001 to 19,593 megawatts in 2025the largest
increase projected for any country in the world.
China has been attempting to develop an indigenous
nuclear technology base for some time. Thus far, Chinas
nuclear power program has used a variety of nuclear
technologies, some imported and some domestic. A goal
of the program, as stated by the chairman of Chinas
Atomic Energy Authority, is to attain independence in
the design, manufacture and operation of large nuclear
power units on the basis of learning [from the] advanced
experience of other countries [19]. Chinas first reactors, Guangdong 1 and 2, were designed by French
Framatome ANP and came on line in 1993 and 1994.
Qinshan 1, which came on line in 1991, was Chinas first
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
domestically designed unit, and its design was scaled up
for Qinshan 2 units 1 and 2 [20]. Qinshan 3 unit 1 is
Chinas first reactor based on Canadian Candu technology. The two Lingao reactors that came on line in 2002
use French technology supplied by Framatome ANP.
South Korea
South Koreas nuclear power capacity is projected to
grow from 12,990 megawatts in 2001 to 27,607 megawatts in 2025 in the reference case. Two 960-megawatt
units, Ulchin 5 and 6, are currently under construction
[21]. The country has pursued an aggressive nuclear
power program since the late 1970s and has announced
plans to build 10 new nuclear power reactors by 2025
(see box below).
Japan
Japan is one of the few advanced industrialized nations
projected to build additional reactors over the 2001-2025
time frame. Japanthe worlds third largest producer of
nuclear power, after the United States and Francecompleted its fifty-third nuclear reactor in 2001, the
798-megawatt Onagawa 3. In the IEO2003 reference
case, Japans nuclear power capacity is projected to
grow from 43,245 megawatts in 2001 to 51,899 megawatts in 2025.
Recent events could stall Japans effort to expand its
nuclear power industry. A scandal of major proportions
emerged in August 2002, when it was disclosed that
Japans largest nuclear power company, Tokyo Electric
The South Korean Standard Nuclear Plant Design
Nuclear power currently provides South Korea with 39
percent of its electricity supply. Because it lacks indigenous energy resources, South Korea was eager to
develop nuclear power for its electricity sector and
began a nuclear power program with the assistance of
the United States in the 1950s. With U.S. aid, South
Korea constructed a nuclear research reactor that was
completed in 1962.
In the early 1970s, South Korea was virtually entirely
reliant on oil for electricity generation, a reliance that
left the nation particularly vulnerable to the first oil
price shock in 1973. In the early 1970s, South Koreas
nuclear power program went into full swing, and its
first nuclear power plant, Kori 1, was completed in
1978. Between 1983 and 1989, eight new plants were
added, and by 1989 nuclear accounted for 51 percent of
South Koreas electricity generation.a
The purpose of South Koreas nuclear power program
was in part to encourage self-reliance in nuclear power
plant construction, operation, and maintenance. It was
also to achieve a high degree of standardization in
order to reduce costs and make operations easier.
South Korea (along with China and India) is one of a
number of developing nations attempting to develop
indigenous nuclear power plant designs. In 1987, ABB
Combustion Engineering and the Korean nuclear
power industry agreed on a 10-year program (which
was extended for another 10 years in 1997) aimed at
transferring nuclear technology to the Korean nuclear
power industry.b
South Korea completed its tenth and eleventh nuclear
power units when Yonggwang units 3 and 4 came on
line in 1995 and 1996. Both of the 960-megawatt units
were based on ABB Combustion Engineerings System
80 design, in collaboration with the Korea Power Engineering Company (KOPEC). KOPECs role grew with
the construction of subsequent units. Yonggwang units
5 and 6, completed in 2002 and 2003, represent the culmination of the South Korean standard nuclear plant
(KSNP) design.
The KSNP program began in 1984 as part of the governments effort to increase South Koreas technological self-reliance in nuclear energy. The KSNP was
developed from incremental design improvements,
which built on the safety and reliability of earlier
proven designs. The Ulchin 3 and 4 units in the North
Kyungsang Province of South Korea, completed in
1998 and 1999, were the first KSNPs. Their design was
in turn derived from the Yonggwang 3 and 4 power
plants, which were modeled on the reactors at the Palo
Verde nuclear generating station in the United States.c
The basis for all these plants is ABBs System 80 design.
The next step in South Koreas nuclear power program
is the development of the advanced Korea Next Generation Reactor (KNGR). In 1992, South Korea began
developing designs for a standard Advanced Power
Reactor 1400 (APR1400), with a goal of design certification occurring by the end of 2002.d

year [23], and by early 2003 Tepco had suspended operations at all of its 17 nuclear reactors [24]. Several of the
other nine nuclear utilities in Japan also reported similar
wrongdoings. In September 2002, two of Japans producers of nuclear power, Chubu Electric Power Co. and
Tohoku Electric Power Co., reported questionable handling of nuclear reactor inspections [25], and by the end
of 2002 a reported 13 nuclear reactors had been shut
down [26]. In reaction to the falsification of inspections
and repairs, the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade
and Industry stated, It is absolutely abominable that
this incident caused the peoples confidence to be largely
lost in nuclear power [27].
These industrial improprieties have heightened public
concern over the reporting practices at Japans nuclear
power plants and the integrity of its nuclear industry.
Whether they will result in a major reevaluation of the
countrys nuclear power future by Japanese policymakers and industry is uncertain.
India
Indias installed nuclear power capacity is projected to
increase from 2,503 megawatts in 2001 to 6,986 in 2025.
Currently, India has 14 nuclear power reactors in operation, which make up 4 percent of the nations electricity
generation capacity. Another 7 nuclear power reactors
are in various stages of construction. Two 450-megawatt
nuclear power reactors, the Tarapur 3 and 4 units, are
expected to become operational by 2009, and the two
960-megawatt Kundankulam 1 and 2 units are expected
to come on line in 2010 and 2011. The 3 remaining reactors now under construction are not expected to be completed during the IEO2003 forecast period. Construction
has also been started on a large prototype fast breeder
reactor.
Middle East and Africa
Iran
Russia is currently working to complete a nuclear power
plant at Bushehr, Iran. Initial construction of two reactors at the site was undertaken by Germany in 1974 but
was suspended in 1979 (after 85 percent of the construction had been completed) in the midst of the Iranian revolution. During Irans war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iraqi
warplanes attacked Bushehr repeatedly. In 1995, Iran
signed an agreement with Russia to complete the two
1,000-megawatt plants at Bushehr. Although both the
United States and Israel have expressed strong opposition to Irans nuclear power program, in July 2002 the
Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) proposed the construction of six additional 1,000-megawatt
units for Iran [28].
South Africa
South Africa, with two 900-megawatt units located at
Koeberg, is the only country in Africa with nuclear
power. No new additions to South Africas nuclear
capacity are expected in the IEO2003 reference case.
South Africas state utility, Eskom, along with South
Africas Industrial Development Corporation, has been
planning to build a pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR).
To date, Eskom and the Industrial Development Corporation have a joint shareholding of more than 50 percent
in the PBMR project. Eskoms partners in the project
originally included BNFL and U.S.-based Exelon; however, Exelon pulled out of the project in April 2002 [29],
stating that:
Becoming a reactor supplier is no longer consistent with
Exelons strategy. Exelon continues to believe that the
PBMR technology has the potential to be viable and successful. Exelons economic and professional support has
done a great deal to advance this technologys development to the point where there is a defined path to the
completion of the commercialization of the technology.
The project is now positioned for other companies with
the appropriate expertise and core business experience to
deliver the PBMR plants to power generators such as
Exelon Generation.
The move followed discussions at the end of 2001
between the PBMR Companyset up by the international consortium behind the project to build and market
the reactorsand Exelon concerning the estimated cost
of a PBMR unit.
At present there is a great deal of uncertainty as to
whether the PBMR project will ever reach fruition. In
November 2001, the PBMR consortium announced that
construction of the first pilot plant would be delayed by
up to 12 months [30]. In addition, earlier expectations
that PBMRs would achieve revolutionary economic
improvements over most existing nuclear technologies
have been dampened. David Nicholls, the PBMR consortiums chief executive officer, has stated that the cost
of a PBMR will not reach $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity
until 32 modules have been constructed [31]. He remains
optimistic, however, that the PBMR project will be completed, stating in June 2002 that he had hoped to receive
approval from South Africas government for a test reactor and to complete a pilot unit by 2007 [32].
Western Europe
Nuclear power capacity in Western Europe is projected
to decline from 126 gigawatts in 2001 to 96 gigawatts in
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
2025 in the reference case. The projected loss would
amount to 23 percent of the regions total nuclear capacity. Several Western European nations remain committed to their plans to phase out nuclear power; however,
those commitments could be modified in view of their
emission reduction commitment obligations under the
Kyoto Protocol. Finland is the only Western European
nation that is committed to the construction of additional nuclear power plants.
Belgium
It appears that Belgium has joined Germany and Sweden in adopting a commitment to phase out nuclear
power. In March 2002, Belgiums inner cabinet voted to
approve legislation aimed at phasing out the nations
nuclear power plants between 2015 and 2025. Individual
plants would be phased out after 40 years of service [33].
At the same time, the Belgium Council of Ministers
decided to phase out the commercial production of
nuclear power in Belgium. In December 2002, Belgiums
House of Representatives passed legislation to close the
nations 7 reactors after 40 years of operation, with the
first one going out of service in 2015 and the last in 2025.
In January 2003, the Belgian Senate voted to phase out all
of the nations nuclear power units not longer than 40
years after their entry into service [34]. Belgiums efforts
to close its nuclear units could prove difficult, however,
in that nuclear power currently provides more than 50
percent of its electricity production. No other nation as
dependent on nuclear power as Belgium is has committed to a complete phaseout of its nuclear plants.
United Kingdom
Nuclear power provided 25 percent of the United Kingdoms electricity supply in 2001, but that share is projected to fall to 10 percent by 2025 in the IEO2003
reference case. Like Japan, the United Kingdom may be
approaching a watershed in its nuclear power program
(see discussion earlier in this chapter). In February 2002,
the governments Performance and Innovation Unit22
issued a review of UK energy [35] which suggested that
the government had adopted a more nuanced view of
the future role for nuclear power:
Nuclear power: a role that cannot yet be defined, since
concerns about radioactive waste and low probability
but high consequence hazards may limit or preclude its
use. Costs of production could fall substantially if new
modular designs are effective. Unlikely to compete with
fossil fuels in power generation on cost alone, but might
have a significant role if low carbon emissions are
required. If renewable costs do not fall as anticipated,
and/or concerns surrounding waste and risks can be
resolved, nuclear would be an obvious candidate for
delivering low carbon electricity . . . .
The report went on to state that any decision to construct
new nuclear capacity would be largely an economic one,
relying on private investors and new technology that
would make the reactors competitive with other generating sources. In January 2003, however, the allegedly
pro-nuclear energy minister, Brian Wilson, called for a
5-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear
power plants. An official white paper on energy policy
from the prime ministers office was released in early
2003, representing the prime ministers official policy.
The document included the following statement: This
white paper does not contain specific proposals for
building new nuclear power stations. However, we do
not rule out the possibility that at some point in the
future new nuclear power builds might be necessary if
we are to meet our carbon targets. Before any decision to
proceed with the building of new power stations, there
will need to be the fullest public consultation and the
publication of a further white paper setting out our proposals [36].
Relying more heavily on nuclear power is one means by
which the United Kingdom could better meet its Kyoto
Protocol commitments. In addition, concerns about
energy security may favor the nuclear option. Domestic
natural gas production began a downward trend in
2001, and concerns have been raised about the future
availability of natural gas supplies, which are expected
to come increasingly from foreign sources. On the other
hand, possible difficulties in financing future nuclear
power projects may have forced the energy ministers
hand. The United Kingdom has two domestic nuclear
power companies, the government-owned BNFL and
the recently privatized British Energy (BE),23 both of
which have had financial difficulties.
Over the past year, BE has encountered several operational and financial difficulties. An unplanned shutdown of BEs Torness 1 nuclear unit in Scotland and
operational difficulties at its Torness 2 and Dungeness B
units precipitated a decline in BEs share price value
[37]. In 2001, BE faced insolvency and reported losses of
22 The Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) was created in 1998 to review the effectiveness of the central government. The purpose of
the PIU is to improve the capacity of government to address strategic, cross-cutting issues and promote innovation in the development of
policy and in the delivery of the Governments objectives. The unit reports directly to the Prime Minister.
23 When the British government set about privatizing its nuclear power assets, it decided that only the countrys most advanced nuclear
power reactors could be sold to the public successfully. These included five advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) in England, two AGRS in
Scotland, and one pressurized-water reactor in England. Older gas-cooled reactors (GCRs), using MAGNOX technology, were to be
retained by the UK government as a public corporation and operated by BNFL, the state-owned nuclear fuel cycle and waste disposal company. In 1996, the more modern reactors were auctioned off in the creation of BE. BE is the largest privately owned nuclear power company
in the world.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
$778 million for the year [38]. As a consequence, the UK
government provided BE with a loan of $640 million to
avoid bankruptcy. Concerns over BEs financial health
caused three major credit-rating agencies to lower the
companys debt rating to below investment grade [39].
BE has said that it is in preliminary steps of exploring
the possibility of selling its interest in Amergena 50-50
joint venture with Exelon of the U.S. [40].
BNFL has also encountered operational difficulties. Like
BE, BNFL has made overseas investments in nuclear
power, including a financial stake in Eskoms PBMR
project in South Africa. It is possible that, if future UK
government policy turns decidedly pro-nuclear, financial support for nuclear plant construction (with loan
guarantees being one of several possible measures)
might be forthcoming.
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
Nuclear power capacity in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (EE/FSU) is projected to decline from
46,321 megawatts in 2001 to 34,722 megawatts in 2025 in
the reference case. In Eastern Europe, nuclear power
capacity is expected to grow slightly after 2015, with
new plants expected to offset the closure of several reactors, many of which are scheduled to be shut down early
in response to safety concerns. Since the breakup of the
Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the European Union
(EU) and the EE/FSU nations have engaged in protracted negotiations to determine the conditions under
which several reactors, deemed dangerous by the EU,
would be decommissioned early. Table 21 provides a
listing of plants for which early closures are being
negotiated.
Another factor that may have motivated the moratorium
on nuclear plant construction is a sharply reduction in
electricity prices under the New Electricity Trading
Arrangement (NETA), a power pool reorganization that
was adopted by the United Kingdom in 2001. Between
March 2001, when NETA was adopted, and March 2002,
baseload electricity prices declined by 20 percent and
peak prices by 27 percent [41]. Lower electricity prices
were blamed for the early closure of the nations two
oldest nuclear plants, Calderhall and Chapelcross [42].
Further, in October 2002, low prices forced PowerGen,
the United Kingdoms second largest electricity producer, to announce that it would idle 1,800 megawatts of
capacity26 percent of the companys total generating
capacity and 2.5 percent of UK capacity [43].
Thus far, both Armenia and Lithuania have been able to
negotiate the shutdown of their nuclear power industries with the EU. Lithuania, which relies on nuclear for
78 percent of its electricity supply agreed to shut down
Ignalina unit 1 in 2005 and unit 2 by 2009. The Lithuanian parliament agreed to the shutdown of both of the
countrys nuclear units, with the proviso that there be
sufficient foreign aid to support closure and that closure should not present an unbearable burden for the
national economy [47]. A large portion of Lithuanias
electricity production is exported and hence a major
source of foreign exchange earnings, and the government has asserted that it might build new plants in the
future [48]. Lithuania was promised 200 million euros
Finland
Table 21. European Union Schedule for Nuclear
Reactor Shutdowns in Eastern Europe
Finland is the only advanced industrialized nation, outside of Japan, projected to build new nuclear power
reactors. After considering an application made in
November 2000 by Finnish utility TVO, the government
in January 2002 approved by a 10-6 cabinet vote the
building of a new nuclear unit. Finland is governed by a
five-party coalition that includes the Green Party, which
opposes nuclear power. In May 2002, the Finnish Parliament authorized the construction of a fifth new reactor
by a vote of 107 to 92. The reactor is to be in operation in
2009. This is the first authorized construction of a
nuclear power plant facility in Europe since the 1986
Chernobyl accident.
In 1993, Parliament rejected a similar proposal, but Finland appears to have adopted a more favorable view
toward nuclear energy since then [44]. In a May 2002
Gallup poll, 54 percent of Finns canvassed approved the
construction of a fifth unit [45]. In September 2002, TVO
announced its specifications for bids to build a new
nuclear reactor. Two sites are being evaluated, TVOs
existing Loviisa and Olkiluoto nuclear power plant sites
[46].

(about $180 million) in grants from the European Commission and 12 other nations to help ease the financial
burden of shutting down its Ignalina I power plant.
Armenia, which operates one nuclear power reactor,
Metsamor II, agreed with the EU in 1999 to close the
plant in 2004, on the condition that the EU provide
Armenia with funds to operate the plant safely during
the interim. In 2001, both sides agreed to postpone the
shutdown until 2006-2007. The Soviet Union had built
two nuclear power reactors in Armenia, Metsamor I
(now retired) and Metsamor II, both with 376 megawatts
of capacity. Metsamor I and II were shut down in 1989
after sustaining earthquake damage. Metsamor II came
back on line in 1995. The international community has
since pressed Armenia to close Metsamor II. The EU has
promised support of 100 million euros and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has
promised 138 million euros for Armenia to find substitute sources of electric power when Metsamor II is
closed [49].
Bulgaria and Slovakia have also been involved in negotiations with the EU over the shutdown of their nuclear
power reactors. The EBRD has targeted the Kozloduy
plant in Bulgaria and the Bohunice plant in the Slovak
Republic for early shutdown. In 1999, the EU and
Slovakia negotiated an agreement whereby Slovakia is
committed to closing down the Bohunice plant between
2006 and 2008. Thus far, negotiations with Bulgaria have
been inconclusive.
Recent negotiations between the EU and Bulgaria highlight the difficulty that Eastern European nations and
the EU have had in closing nuclear power plants.
Nuclear power accounts for nearly one-half of Bulgarias
electricity supply. Bulgarias nuclear power industry
consists of four 408-megawatt nuclear power reactors,
Kozloduy 1 through 4, and two 953-megawatt units,
Kozloduy 5 and 6. Kozloduy units 1 through 4 are Russian-built VVER 440/230 reactors that were completed
in 1974, 1975, 1981, and 1982. The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) declared in 1991 that Kozloduy 1
and 2 were the most dangerous nuclear power units in
Europe, but that assessment has been strongly denied by
the Bulgarian government [50].
In 1999, in an effort to gain entry into the EU, the former
Bulgarian prime minister Ivan Kostov and the EU
pledged to close units Kozloduy 1 and 2 before 2003 and
to agree on a final date for closure of units 3 and 4 by the
end of 2002. The EU has taken the position that units 3
and 4 must be closed no later than 2006 [51]. At the same
time, Bulgaria announced that it intended eventually to
restart construction at Belene, where work was stopped
in 1990 [52]. The EU committed 200 million euros to help
Bulgaria close Kozloduy units 1 and 2, and in February
2001 Westinghouse announced that it will modernize
Kozloduy units 5 and 6. Bulgaria began the shutdown of
Kozloduy units 1 and 2 on December 31, 2002 [53].
In 2002, after a series of upgrades on Kozloduy 3 and 4,
the IAEA declared that the safety of units 3 and 4 corresponds widely to the safety levels of plants of the same
vintage worldwide and that the life of the units could
be lengthened by an additional 35-40 years [54]. For
several years, Bulgaria has tried to renegotiate the shutdown of Kozloduy 3 and 4. Calling for a peer review by
EU member states, the Bulgarian foreign policy minister
stated that should this review reveal that reactors 3 and
4 have not reached the necessary level of nuclear safety
for reactors of the same vintage in the member states . . .
we shall close them unconditionally. However, if the
review shows that the reactors are in a new design condition and can function fully safely for years ahead, if
they meet the requirements of the national regulator, the
member states shall modify their position paper on the
energy chapter, and delete the two units from the list of
reactors subject to early closure [55]. In October 2002,
Minister of Energy Milo Kovachev stated that the government did not intend to close units 3 and 4.
Russia
Nuclear power capacity in Russia is projected to fall
from 20,793 megawatts in 2001 to 14,463 megawatts in
2025 in the IEO2003 reference case. In 1997, the Russian
government approved a nuclear power construction
program that would expand capacity to 29,200 megawatts by 2010. It is Russias announced intention to
replace retired nuclear capacity by new construction at
the same site, to optimize the use of established infrastructure and personnel. Three advanced reactor
designs are envisaged in the program. All this is seen as
a precursor to large-scale nuclear energy development
after 2010. Russia also plans to refurbish and extend the
lives of existing reactors [56].
Ukraine
Ukraine has also undergone protracted negotiations
with the EU over the fate of the nations nuclear power
industry. Much of the finance for completing two stalled
but largely built reactors has recently been pledged. The
two units will replace lost output from Chernobyl.
Although the unitsKhmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 (K2
and R4)today are 80 percent complete, it is not clear
that either unit will ever be connected to the grid. Construction on both units was aborted in 1991 after the
breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1995, the EBRD and the
Group of Seven (G7) signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukraines government. An important
goal of the EBRD and G7 was to encourage Ukraine to
shut down its remaining Chernobyl vintage reactors. As
a form of compensation, the EBRD agreed to fund the
completion of K2 and R4. An understanding was
reached that K2 and R4 would be operated at western
safety levels.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
The $1.48 billion in funding for the completion and
safety upgrade of K2 and R4 was to have come from a
number of sources: $580 million from Euratom, $348
million from export credit agencies, $215 million from
the EBRD, $123 million from Russia, $159 million from
Energoatom (the Ukraine nuclear power utility), and
$50 million from the Ukrainian government. As coordinator of the loan package, EBRDs funding became critical to the future of the project. Energoatom and the
EBRD had a difficult time negotiating a loan agreement.
Initially, the EBRD approved a $215 million loan in
December 2000, pending certain conditions involving
safety and funding availability. In December 2001, however, loan negotiations foundered over an inability to
agree on a future rate structure for sales of electricity
from the two plants. Since the beginning of 2002, the
negotiations have shown little progress.
Throughout 2002, Ukraine also negotiated with Russia
to provide funding for the completion of the K2 and R4
units. Inasmuch as Russian equipment is expected to be
used, Russia has an incentive to see the projects through
to completion. In mid-2002 Russia agreed to provide 50
percent of the funding for R4 [57], and in October 2002
Ukrainian government officials stated that the EBRD
had indicated that it was ready to resume talks on project financing [58]. In November 2002, Ukraines Parliament ratified a state loan agreement with Russia, and in
December it was signed by the Ukrainian president,
Leonid Kuchma [59, 60].
to bring Pickering As first four units back on line by
2001, but the costs of restarting them mushroomed from
$800 million to more than $2 billion [64].
United States
Installed nuclear generating capacity in the United
States is projected to increase from 98.2 gigawatts in 2001
to 99.6 gigawatts in 2025 in the reference case. The
increase is expected to result not from new construction
but from uprates of existing capacity. In general, the
IEO2003 forecast views the construction of nuclear
power plants in the United States as unlikely, because
they are less economical to construct than plants fired by
natural gas or coal. In 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) authorized uprates at 22 nuclear
power plants, which would increase nuclear capacity in
the United States by 1,111 megawattsthe equivalent of
adding an additional large nuclear power unit [65]. U.S.
nuclear facilities also reported a record high average
capacity utilization rate of 89.3 percent in 2001, as compared with 66 percent in 1990.
The Bush Administrations energy plan calls for the
expansion of nuclear energy as a major component of
our national energy policy [66]. Current U.S. energy
goals include an intended new build by the end of the
current decade. The Administrations National Energy
Policy, released in May 2001 [67], supports an expanded
role for nuclear power, including the following
recommendations:
Encourage the NRC to expedite applications for
licensing new advanced-technology reactors
North America
Canada
Canadas nuclear power capacity is projected to grow
from 10,018 megawatts in 2001 to 11,576 megawatts in
2025 in the IEO2003 reference case. Seven of Canadas
nuclear power units were shut down in 1998, and the
prospects for bringing them back into service are mixed.
In 1997, Ontario Hydro commissioned an analysis of the
operating performance of its nuclear reactors, the results
of which led Ontario Hydro to retire or suspend the
operation of seven units at its Bruce and Pickering
nuclear power plants. As a result of the closuresthe
largest nuclear shutdown in historyCanada lost more
than 5,000 megawatts, or one-third, of its total nuclear
electricity capacity [61].
In July 2000, Ontario Power Generation leased the Bruce
A and B power plants until at least 2018 to Bruce Power
Partnership, which is owned by British Energy (95 percent ) and the power plant employees (5 percent). Bruce
Power Partnership also acquired an option to extend the
lease to 2043. As of late 2002, Bruce Power was expected
to restart Bruce 4 in April 2003 and Bruce 3 in June 2003
[62]. Also, in October 2002, Ontario Power Generation
announced its intention to bring Pickering 4 back on line
by July 2003 [63]. Ontario Hydro had initially intended
Encourage the NRC to facilitate efforts by utilities to
expand nuclear energy generation by uprating existing plants
Encourage the NRC to relicense existing nuclear

Provide a deep geologic repository for nuclear waste
Support legislation to extend the Price-Anderson
Act, which places financial limits on the liability of a

Also in 2001, in a separate measure, the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) solicited proposals from the civilian
nuclear electricity industry to conduct scoping studies
of potential sites for the deployment of new nuclear
power plants [68].
Several developments in 2002 showed additional promise for the U.S. nuclear industry:
In May 2002, the Board of Directors of the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) voted to restart Browns
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Ferry 1, which has been shut down for 17 years. TVA
plans to bring the unit back on line in May 2007, at an
estimated cost of $1.7 to $1.8 billion. In October 2002,
TVA reached an agreement with Bechtel Power to
provide engineering and technical services for the
restart. Bechtel stated that it intended to complete the
restart by the 2007 deadline [69].
In June 2002, DOE announced the selection of three
U.S. electric utilities to participate in a joint government/industry projects to evaluate and obtain NRC
approval for sites where new nuclear power plants
could be built [70]. Dominion Resources, Entergy
Nuclear, and Exelon have announced plans for early
site permit applications. Entergy is focusing on four
nuclear plants sites in the South, with particular
emphasis on River Bend and Grand Gulf as potential
locations for additional reactors.
In July 2002, President Bush signed legislation designating Yucca Mountain as a site for the disposal of
nuclear waste.
The Presidents budget proposal for 2003 included a
provision to increase spending on nuclear technology research to $46.5 million, from $12 million in
2002.
The Omnibus Appropriations Resolution signed by
President Bush on February 20, 2003, included a provision to extend the Price-Anderson Act. Final
approval is dependent on congressional approval of
a comprehensive energy bill or a vote on
Price-Anderson as a separate piece of legislation.
Not all recent events have been promising for nuclear
power in the United States, however. In February 2002,
the Davis-Besse reactor in Ohio was shut down after significant corrosion damage to the reactor vessel head was
discovered. A hole was found in the reactors pressure
vessel, the result of boric acid seeping through cracks in
two of the control rod drive mechanism nozzles. The discovery prompted the NRC to order the inspection of vessel heads in all U.S. pressurized-water reactors [71].

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Hydroelectricity and Other Renewable Resources
The renewable energy share of total world energy consumption is expected to
remain unchanged at 8 percent through 2025, despite a projected 56-percent
increase in consumption of hydroelectricity and other renewable resources.
In the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference case, moderate growth in the worlds consumption
of hydroelectricity and other renewable energy resources is projected over the next 24 years. Renewable
energy sources are not expected to compete economically with fossil fuels in the mid-term forecast. In the
absence of significant government policies aimed at
reducing the impacts of carbon-emitting energy sources
on the environment, it will be difficult to extend the use
of renewables on a large scale. IEO2003 projects that consumption of renewable energy worldwide will grow by
56 percent, from 32 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 50 quadrillion Btu in 2025 (Figure 69).
Much of the projected growth in renewable generation is
expected to result from the completion of large hydroelectric facilities in developing countries, particularly in
developing Asia, where the need to expand electricity
production often outweighs concerns about environmental impacts and the relocation of populations to
make way for large dams and reservoirs. China, India,
Malaysia, and Vietnam, among others, are constructing
or planning new, large-scale hydroelectric facilities.
In September 2002, Malaysia awarded the main

construction contract for the 2,400-megawatt Bakun
hydroelectric project to Sime Engineering. At the end of
2002, India was poised to begin the final phase of reservoir filling for the 2,000-megawatt Tehri dam [1]. The
first electricity generating units of Chinas
18,200-megawatt Three Gorges Dam hydropower project are scheduled to be installed in 2003 [2]. Of the 37
electric power projects planned for construction by the
Vietnamese government by 2020, 22 are hydroelectric
facilities, several with capacities of 600 megawatts or
more [3].
Many nations of Central and South America also have
plans to expand their already well-established hydroelectric resources. Brazil, Peru, and even oil-rich Venezuela have plans to increase hydroelectric capacity over
the next decade. Brazil alone has plans to offer tenders
for 34 new hydroelectric energy stations in 2003, with a
combined 9,100 megawatts of capacity [4], despite a
crippling drought in 2000-2001 that resulted in electricity rationing and threatened brownouts. Many of
Brazils new hydroelectric projects will be located in the
northeastern part of the country, which was not as
severely affected by the drought. In general, however,
the nations of Central and South America are not
expected to expand hydroelectric resources dramatically but instead are expected to invest in other sources
of electricityparticularly, natural-gas-fired capacity
that will allow them to diversify electricity supplies
away and reduce their reliance on hydropower.
Hydroelectric capacity outside the developing world is
not expected to grow substantially. Among the industrialized nations, only Canada has plans to construct any
sizable hydroelectric projects over the forecast period.
Hydro-Qubec alone is planning to add some 2,100
megawatts of additional hydroelectric capacity within
the next decade [5]. In the countries of Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union (EE/FSU), most additions
to hydroelectric capacity are expected to come from
repair or expansion of existing plants. In the industrialized and EE/FSU regions, most hydroelectric resources
either have already been developed or lie far from population centers.
Among the other (nonhydroelectric) renewable energy
sources, wind power has been the fastest growing
in recent years. In Western Europe, Germany, Denmark,
Spain, and other nations have installed significant
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
amount of new wind power capacity. Germany installed
2,659 megawatts of new wind capacity in 2001, a
national and world record for wind installation in a single year [6]. In Spain and Denmark, wind power is doing
so well that the governments are considering the elimination of subsidies aimed at promoting its installation.
Wind power also advanced strongly in the United States
in 2001, largely because of the threatened end of the production tax credit for wind energy (which has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2003). Sixteen
States installed 1,695 megawatts of new wind capacity in
2001, setting a national record and accounting for
one-third of the total new wind capacity worldwide.
Both houses of the U.S. Congress have included proposals to extend the production tax credit in their versions
of the Bush Administrations proposed Energy Bill,
which if enacted would extend the program through
December 31, 2006 [7].
The IEO2003 projections for hydroelectricity and other
renewable energy resources include only on-grid
renewables. Noncommercial fuels from plant and animal sources are an important source of energy, particularly in the developing world. The International Energy
Agency has estimated that some 2.4 billion people in
developing countries depend on traditional biomass for
heating and cooking [8]. However, comprehensive data
on the use of noncommercial fuels are not available and,
as a result, cannot be included in the projections. Moreover, dispersed renewables (renewable energy consumed on the site of its production, such as solar panels
used to heat water) are not included in the projections,
because there are also few comprehensive sources of
international data on their use.
hydroelectric generation in the future. EIAs Annual
Energy Outlook 2003 (AEO2003) projects that U.S. conventional hydroelectric generation will rise from 214 billion kilowatthours in 2001 to 302 billion kilowatthours in
2005 and remain at about that level through 2025.
Nonhydroelectric renewables are expected to account
for 4.0 percent of all projected additions to U.S. generating capacity between 2000 and 2025. Generation from
geothermal, biomass, landfill gas, solar, and wind
energy is projected to increase from 81 billion kilowatthours in 2000 to 189 billion kilowatthours in 2025. Biomass (which includes cogeneration and co-firing in
coal-fired power plants) is expected to grow from 38 billion kilowatthours in 2000 to 78 billion kilowatthours in
2025. Most of the increase is attributed to cogenerators,
with a smaller amount from co-firing. Few new dedicated biomass plants are expected to be constructed over
the forecast period.
North America
The reference case projects substantial increments in
U.S. geothermal and wind power. Geothermal capacity,
all located in western States, is projected to increase to
5,600 megawatts, supplying 37 billion kilowatthours of
electricity (0.6 percent of total generation) by 2025 [9].
Wind capacity in the United States is projected to grow
by nearly 300 percent over the forecast period, from
4,290 megawatts in 2001 to 12,000 megawatts by 2025.
Wind capacity was installed in 22 States by the end of
2001 (Figure 70), and State mandates for increasing the
development of renewable energy sources are expected
to provide the impetus for the large increment in wind
power over the forecast. Where enacted, State renewable
portfolio standards, which specify a minimum share of
generation or sales from renewable sources, are considered in the U.S. forecast. Federal subsidies for renewables (in particular, wind) are also included in the
projections.
As of January 1, 2001, the three countries of North Americathe United States, Canada, and Mexicohad a
combined 176 gigawatts of installed hydropower and
other renewable capacity for electricity generation.
Hydropower accounts for most of the renewable capacity in the region, with nonhydroelectric, on-grid renewable energy contributing just 17 gigawatts of the total. In
the future, capacity fueled by alternative renewable
energy sourcesparticularly wind but also geothermal
and solaris expected to expand more rapidly than
hydroelectric capacity; however, hydroelectricity is projected to remain the dominant component of the renewable mix. Renewable energy consumption in the region
is projected to increase from 9.4 quadrillion Btu in 2001
to 13.9 quadrillion Btu in 2025.
Canada
Canada has extensively developed its hydroelectric
capabilities. Hydroelectricity is the countrys dominant
source of electric power, accounting for 67,000 megawatts of the 111,000 megawatts of total installed generating capacity. Canada is one of the only industrialized
countries that is expected to expand its mid- to largescale hydroelectric capacity. Hydro-Qubec alone has
four sizable hydroelectric projects that are expected to be
commissioned within the next decade, including the
480-megawatt Eastmain 1 (scheduled for completion in
2008), the 526-megawatt Toulnustouc (2005); the 882megawatt Sainte Marguerite 3 (2003); and the replacement of the existing Grand Mre hydroelectric facility
with a 220-megawatt facility (2004) [10].
United States
Potential sites for hydroelectric dams have already
been largely established in the United States, and regulatory requirements are projected to limit conventional
Other hydroelectric projects are also under consideration throughout Canada. Canadas Northwest Territories government is considering development of six
hydroelectric projects that would add some 11,630
Regional Activities
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
megawatts of new capacity [11]. On the Mackenzie River
alone, there are proposals to install 10,500 megawatts of
hydroelectric capacity. Other projects include a 200megawatt run-of-river plant on the Talston River, a 600megawatt project on the Bear River, and a 270-megawatt
project on the Lockhart River. Two small hydroelectric
facilities are also under consideration, the 33-megawatt
Upper Snare River project and the 27-megawatt Lac La
Marte River project. The territorial government has
announced its intention to export the electricity from
the six projects to Alberta Province as well as to U.S.
markets.
Negotiations have continued between Newfoundland
and Labrador and Qubec provinces on the proposed
development of a hydroelectric plant with two dams on
the Lower Churchill River in Labrador. In 1998, the two
provinces agreed to construct the 3,200-megawatt project, but financing difficulties caused the project to be
shelved [12]. In 2001, however, U.S. aluminum company
Alcoa, Inc., and the Newfoundland provincial government together funded a feasibility study for the revival
of the Lower Churchill project. The new proposal
reduced the size of the project to 2,000 megawatts of
hydroelectric capacity, with an estimated cost of $1.6 billion [13]. It would still consist of two damsone at Gull
Island and one at Muskrat Falls [14]. Whereas the
original project envisioned exporting the electricity produced to the U.S. market, Alcoa would like to use the
output to power one or more new aluminum smelters in
the province, and the Newfoundland government has
also discussed exporting the electricity to neighboring
Qubec province [15]. The government still must secure
consent to construct the Lower Churchill Falls project
from the indigenous Innu Nation. If the project receives
final approval, it is expected to begin operation by 2012.
In addition to hydropower, Canada has been developing new wind capacity. A reported 198 megawatts of
wind capacity was operating in Canada at the end of
2001. Several new wind facilities were commissioned in
2001, including North Americas largest commercial
wind turbine, a 1.8-megawatt unit at the Pickering
Nuclear Generating Station [16]. In February 2002, the
first wind project in the province of Saskatchewan began
operation, an 11-megawatt project at Gull Lake [17]. The
Gull Lake project, located on the Trans-Canada Highway about 200 miles west of Regina, consists of 17 wind
turbines. It cost some $15 million to construct and
was financed, in part, by an $8 million subsidy from
the Canadian government for promoting green
energy development in Saskatchewan. Provincial utility

Hydro-Qubec has also committed to calling for bids to
construct wind power capacity and has stated its intention to finance 1,000 megawatts of new capacity between
2003 and 2013 [18]. The utility also has plans to support
the development of 200 megawatts of forest biomass
capacity over the same period.
Mexico
Hydroelectric generation currently provides 20 percent
of Mexicos total electricity supply and is its predominant source of renewable energy. Most hydropower
sites are in the southern part of the country. A drought in
2002 reduced output from hydroelectric plants substantially, with the Mexican Energy Ministry reporting that
hydroelectric reservoir levels were at 10-year lows [19].
Although Mexicos hydroelectric capacity is not expected to grow substantially in the IEO2003 reference
case, there are plans to construct new capacity over the
next decade. The most ambitious plan is for the construction of the 750-megawatt El Cajn hydroelectric
project, the first large-scale hydropower project to be
considered for construction in Mexico in more than a
decade [20]. The state-owned Comisin Federal de Electricidad (CFE) has called for bids to construct what is
being called the largest publicly funded infrastructure to
be financed by Mexicos Fox Administration. El Cajn is
to be located in the municipalities of Yesca and Santa
Maria del Oro in Nayarit state on Mexicos west coast.
The project is expected to cost an estimated $650 million
to complete, with a 610-foot high dam, the highest of its
kind in the world. Construction on El Cajn is slated to
begin in the first quarter of 2003 and scheduled for completion in the summer of 2007. Construction was
expected to begin on January 31, 2003, and to be completed by the end of August 2007.
Of the other, nonhydroelectric renewable sources of
energy, geothermal energy is most widely established in
Mexico. In 2002, Mexico reported 855 megawatts of
installed geothermal capacity, making the country the
third largest producer of geothermal electricity in the
world, behind the United States and Philippines [21].
CFE has estimated that another 1,000 megawatts of
geothermal capacity could be developed in Mexico. Currently, however, there are only two geothermal electricity plants under construction, the 100-megawatt Los
Azufres plant in Michocn state and the 10-megawatt
Las Tres Vgenes plant in Baja California [22].
Wind power has had a difficult time advancing in Mexico, although there are rich wind resources in the southern La Ventosa region. By some estimates, La Ventosa
could support up to 2,000 megawatts of installed wind
capacity [23]. Thus far, however, there are only two significant wind projects operating in Mexico, the
1.5-megawatt La Venta project located in La Ventosa
and the 0.6-megawatt Guerrero Negro project in Baja
California. There are other small wind turbines operating in remote parts of the country.
Nonhydroelectric renewables received some muchneeded support in 2001 from the Mexican government,
which announced that it would invest $14 million on
renewable energy projects in 2002. The government has
announced goals to increase wind capacity to 2,000
megawatts by 2006 and solar energy to 13 megawatts by
2009.
Partly as a result of government incentives, wind power
capacity is expected to increase substantially in Mexico
over the next several years. The Mexican company
Fuerza Elica del Istmo has obtained government permission to construct a 30-megawatt wind farm in the
south central Mexican state of Oaxaca [24]. Upon completion, the plant will provide electricity for a cement
factory owned by Cementos de la Cruz Azul. Fuerza
Elica del Istmo has proposed four additional projects to
Mexicos Energy Regulatory Commission, which would
add another 215 megawatts of wind capacity. There also
some efforts to add solar energy to Mexicos renewable
energy mix, with BP attempting to deliver solar generated electricity to some 300 rural communities in 15
municipalities.
Western Europe
With most of its hydroelectric resources already extensively developed, wind remains the fastest growing
renewable energy source in Western Europe. According
to the European Wind Energy Association, wind energy
capacity reached 20,447 megawatts in the fourth quarter
of 2002, so that Western Europe now accounts for 74 percent of the worlds total wind capacity [25]. Germany,
Denmark, and Spain continued to see the fastest
regional growth in new wind power installations, but
several other countriesnotably, the United Kingdom
and Irelandalso have made advances in wind power
development.
The German market for wind generation remains especially strong. In August 2002, Germany passed the
10,000-megawatt milestone for installed wind capacity
mark and estimated that it would reach 11,750 megawatts by the end of the year [26]. There are more than
12,000 wind turbines currently operating in Germany,
and the government has set a goal of 20,000 megawatts
by 2010 [27]. In the IEO2003 reference case, Western
Europes consumption of hydroelectricity and other
renewable energy is projected to grow by 1.5 percent per
year on average, from 6.1 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 8.8
quadrillion Btu in 2025 (Figure 71).
One indicator of the success of wind power development in Western Europe is the fact that, after many years
of subsidizing wind generation, several countries are
now considering eliminating or scaling back the subsidies. Denmark is among the worlds most successful
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
wind markets, with approximately 2,500 megawatts of
installed wind capacity in 2001, sufficient to meet 12.6
percent of the countrys total electricity needs [28]. Wind
installations in Denmark have already exceeded the
goals set by the governments Energy 21 program in
1996, which called for the installation of 1,500 megawatts by 2005. The program has a target of 5,500 megawatts of wind capacity by 2030, of which 4,000
megawatts will be offshore. In part because of the success of the countrys wind program, the Danish government has announced that it will not renew the subsidies
for new wind turbines, beginning in 2004 [29].
Spain is also considering removal of its renewable
energy subsidies. With 3,337 megawatts of installed
wind capacity at the end of 2001, Spain has the second
largest amount of installed wind capacity in Western
Europe, after Germany [30]. In October 2002, Spanish
Energy Minister Jose Folgado stated that renewable
energy use in Spain was on schedule to provide up to 25
percent of the countrys electricity generation within 10
years [31]. He further noted that wind, biomass, and
hydroelectric facilities were strengthened enough so
that they could now compete in an open market. The
Spanish Minister instead supports the implementation
of a green certificate program under a Renewable
Energy Certificate System. Under the proposed scheme,
national authorities would issue certificates verifying
the amount of electricity produced, and the certificates
could be sold to those who wished to purchase electricity from a certain source, such as wind.
The wind market in the United Kingdom (UK) has
developed more slowly than those in other countries.

aversion to wind farms have made it difficult to install
wind turbines [32]. At the end of 2001, 468 megawatts of
wind capacity had been installed in the UK, far less than
the 2,676 megawatts of wind capacity with power purchase contracts under the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation,
which had been used before 2001 to secure funding for
renewable energy sources.
In April 2002, the UK enacted its newest Renewable
Obligation (RO) under the New Electricity Trading
Arrangements program [33], which replaced the
Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation program used to collect
taxes to support the countrys nuclear power plants and
renewable energy projects. Under the terms of the new
RO, electricity suppliers are required to provide 3 percent of their electricity sales from approved renewable
energy sources until March 2003, and the requirement
rises to 10.4 percent of sales in March 2011. If the supplier cannot meet its requirements, it must purchase
renewable certificates. The cost of the certificates has
been set at about $47 (30 British pounds) per megawatthour, which may be adjusted after April 1, 2003, in accordance with the retail price index for electricity [34]. The
RO also includes provisions for financing energy crops
and offshore wind programs and establishes a $158 million renewable energy fund.
Several renewable energy projects advanced in the UK
in 2002. In July, the 30-megawatt Bein an Tuirc wind
project began operating at Carradale on the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland [35]. The project consists of 46 660kilowatt turbines, which are expected to provide enough
electricity to supply 25,000 homes. It is hoped to be the
first of three wind farms developed by Scottish Power.
The $32.3 million project is capable of producing power
very efficiently, because it is situated on the Kintyre peninsula where wind resources are among the best in
Western Europe, according to the UK Department of
Trade and Industry. Scottish Power hopes to install at
least another 785 megawatts of wind capacity by 2010,
which would meet more than one-half of Scotlands
renewables target.
In June 2002, Canadian oil producer Talisman Energy
announced that it would install a 500-megawatt offshore
wind project near one of the UKs oil fields off the northern coast of Scotland [36]. The UK initiated a feasibility
study of the proposed project, which will consist of up to
120 turbines, and in July 2002 consent was granted for its
construction. When it is completed it will be the largest
offshore wind project in the UK. The 90-megawatt North
Hoyle wind project, to be constructed about 5 miles from
the North Wales Coast in Denbighshire, is scheduled for
completion by the end of 2003. It will supply electricity
for more than 50,000 homes.
Ireland has only recently begun introducing windpowered electricity to its energy mix. To encourage the
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
development of renewable energy capacity in the country, the Irish government approved $404 million for
renewable energy projects, with the hope that the investment would double the amount of electricity generated
from wind, biomass, and hydroelectric resources [37].
In July 2002 the Irish energy company Airtricity announced that it had begun construction on Irelands first
wind farm. The 25-megawatt facility is being constructed on the Irish west coast, near Sligo. The project
was expected to cost approximately $34 million and to
be operational by spring 2003.
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
There are only a few plans to expand the use of renewable resources in the countries of Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union (EE/FSU). Much of the increment
in hydroelectricity from 2001 to 2025 is expected to be in
the form of repairing and expanding existing facilities
that suffered from a lack of maintenance during the
Soviet era. In general, renewables are not competitive in
the FSU, where fossil fuel resources are abundant and
demand for clean forms of electricity can be met with
cheaper natural-gas-fired capacity. There has begun to
be some modest activity, however, toward exploiting
wind resources and other nonhydroelectric renewable
energy resources among the former Soviet Republics.
Renewable energy demand in the FSU is projected to
increase by 0.8 percent per year over the forecast period.
In Eastern Europe, the growth rates projected for hydroelectricity and other renewables are substantially higher
than those for the FSU at 2.2 percent per year, reflecting
the relatively small amount of renewable capacity currently installed in the region. By 2025, the reference case
projects that use of hydropower and other renewable
energy sources in Eastern Europe will be 43 percent of
the current level in the FSU (Figure 72).
Former Soviet Union
Although most of the development of hydroelectric
resources in the FSU today consists of updates and
repairs to old infrastructure, Armenia has announced
plans to construct several new hydroelectric projects
over the next several years. Armenia has developed
plans to construct 38 small and 3 large hydroelectric
power plants, with a combined installed capacity of 296
megawatts [38]. Two of the three large hydropower projects, the 60-megawatt Lori Berd and the 75-megawatt
Shnokh, are to be located in the northeastern part of the
country. The third, the 79-megawatt Megri, is to be sited
on the Araks River on the Armenian-Iranian border. The
estimated cost of the Megri project, which would take 5
years to complete, is between $60 million and $80 million. The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have committed to part
of the funding for the $300 million program. No construction schedule has yet been submitted, and the
Azerbaijan government is protesting the plan, arguing
that its Nakhichevan region would be adversely
affected.
In Azerbaijan, the 4,000-megawatt Yenikand hydroelectric project was completed in 2000 [39]. Construction on
Yenikand began in 1985, but work was suspended in
1987 as a result of financing difficulties. Construction
resumed in 1996 with the help of a $53 million loan from
the World Bank. In 2001, the restoration of the $41 million Mingechaur hydropower project was completed.
The 360-megawatt project is located on the Kura River.
Georgia has announced plans to construct two new
hydroelectric projects on the Rioni River, the 250megawatt Namakhvani and the 100-megawatt Zhoneti.
The country is attempting to attract foreign investment
to fund the additions. In September 2001, the Georgian-Chinese Energokorporatsia Vostoka company
opened the first phase of the 24-megawatt Khador
hydroelectric project near the Georgian-Russian border
in the eastern Kakheti region. The project is scheduled to
be completed before the end of 2003. In January 2002,
Georgia announced that Chinas Sichuan Machinery,
which is constructing Khador, would invest $10 million
in a second hydroelectric station in Georgia. The 9.3megawatt plant will be built on the Chelta River in the
Kakheti region.
There are also plans to expand hydroelectric capacity in
Russia. The largest project currently under construction
in Russia is the Bureyskaya hydroelectric project. Construction on this 2,320-megawatt project in the Russian
Far East region of Amur was started in 1976, but work
was suspended because of difficulties in securing

of Russia (UES) resumed construction on Bureyskaya in
2000, and it is now scheduled to begin operating by the
end of 2003. UES has also announced a scheme for constructing a 20,000-megawatt hydroelectric station, the
Turukhan project, on the Nizhnaya Tunguska River [41].
According to UES, Turukhan would be used to supply
electricity to western parts of Russia, as well as for
exports to Europe. On a smaller scale, in 2002 construction began on the 15-megawatt Gunibskaya power station on the Karakoysu River in the Russian Republic of
Dagestan [42].
Frances Electricit de France. Enel signed an initial
agreement to undertake a feasibility study on eight
hydroelectric facilities on five rivers, including the
75-megawatt Comesti-Movileni project on the Siret
River, the 116-megawatt Cornetu-Avrig project on the
Olt River, and the 22-megawatt Valea Sadului on the Jiu
River, as well as a water supply tunnel at the Raul Mare
Retezat facility [47]. The company has estimated the cost
of work on the entire set of projects at $400 million to
$500 million. Hidroelectrica has announced that it will
make a decision about development plans for the
remaining 12 projects in the first quarter of 2003.
The FSU is seeing increasing interest from the international community for participation in the development
of nonhydroelectric renewable energy resources. Russias first commercial wind project began operating in
the Kaliningrad region in July 2002 [43]. The 45-megawatt Kulikovo project was constructed by UES and the
Danish company SEAS, and there are already plans to
construct a second wind facility offshore in the same
region.
Several other East European countries have made plans
to renovate or add hydroelectric capacity. In Hungary,
there are plans to modernize the 28-megawatt Kiskorei
Vizeromu hydroelectric facility [48]. A consortium led
by Hungarian-based Siemens RT estimates that the $10.4
million upgrade will be completed by 2006. U.S. Triangle General Contractors has begun a feasibility study for
the upgrade of the Koshnjentin hydroelectric project in
Kosovo, near the Albanian border [49]. Local authorities
are also investigating the possibility of constructing a
new hydroelectric project at Zhur. Macedonia is beginning to add several small hydroelectric facilities. In July
2002, construction on the fifth of six hydroelectric plants
in the Stezevo cascade began [50]. The 8.8-megawatt
Lera hydroelectric project is scheduled for completion in
early 2004. The project is being financed through a $7.5
million credit from the Spanish government. The
Stezevo hydroelectric system will be completed with a
2.5-megawatt power plant near Kazani.
Estonia is another FSU country that has made moves to
develop wind-powered electricity generation. In October 2002, the countrys first commercial wind project, the
Virtsu Wind Park, began operation [44]. The 1.8-megawatt project was constructed as a joint venture between
state-owned utility Eesti Energia, U Roheline Ring,
and German wind turbine manufacturer Enercon
GmbH at an estimated cost of $2.4 million, funded by the
German Federal Ministry of Economics and the Estonian
Regional Development fund. The utility has also granted a licence to Estwind Energy (which has subsequently
been acquired by Canadian Secureview Systems, Inc.) to
install a total of 3 megawatts of wind capacity, divided
between Saamemaa and Tostamaa [45]. Estonia is particularly interested in renewable energy projects to meet its
renewable requirements for European Union membership. The country hopes to increase the renewable share
of its total energy use to 10 percent (from 1 percent at
present), but no timetable has been set. Eesti Energia
established a subsidy for renewable energy generation
as an incentive for increasing renewable energy projects.
Eastern Europe
Among the countries of Eastern Europe, Romania has
perhaps the greatest potential to expand its use of
hydroelectricity. To date, only about 6 megawatts of
hydroelectric capacity has been installed in Romania. In
September 2001, state-owned Hidroelectrica and the
Romanian Ministry of Industry and Resources tendered
21 hydroelectric projects, involving the completion of 36
hydroelectric plants by 2004 at an estimated cost of $1.3
billion [46]. Hidroelectrica is attempting to finalize deals
for the first 9 of the 21 projects that have received bids
from potential investors, which include Italys Enel and
Plans to expand Bulgarias hydroelectric capacity have
been hampered somewhat both by financing difficulties
and by protracted efforts to privatize the countrys electric power sector. Privatization of the electric utility sector is expected to be completed by June 2003, with the
sale of seven Bulgarian electricity companies [51].
State-owned Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania
(NEK) has been unbundled into three generating companies, in addition to distributors. Twenty-two hydroelectric power plants are to be sold to private companies.
NEK has announced plans to renovate or complete a
number of hydroelectric projects, most notably the $300
million Gorna Arda project. Plans to renovate the
170-megawatt Gorna Arda ran into difficulties in 2000
when Turkeys Ceylan Holding faced financial problems. Italys Enel expressed an interest in taking on the
project in late 2001 and by mid-2002 had been chosen by
an international tender to complete the project, but
shareholders of the Gorna Arda project were unable to
oust Ceylan Holding, which owns 31 percent of the joint
venture. The project remains stalled, and deadlines for
the completion of Enels feasibility study for Gorna Arda
have been repeatedly delayed [52]. NEK financed the
construction of the first plant in the complex, the Madan
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
hydroelectric project, which is scheduled for completion
in early 2003. Enel has also launched a feasibility study
for a hydroelectric project to be sited in central Bulgaria
on the Cherni Osum reservoir [53]. If the outcome of the
study is positive, construction on the estimated $82 million project could start as early as fall 2003.
One Eastern European country that has made some substantial moves to increase its wind-generated electricity
capacity is Poland. Poland is expected to join the European Union in 2004 and, as a result, must increase its
renewable energy use to meet EU obligations of 12 percent of total electricity generation by 2010 [54]. Poland
has stated it will spend $3.2 billion over the next decade
for the development of wind, water, and biomass (i.e.,
straw) generators, as well as solar panels. In April 2002,
the German company P&T Technology announced that
it would install 1,500 megawatts of wind capacity before
2012. The first 220 megawatts of capacitywind turbines located near the city of Poznan and in northeastern
Polandare expected to begin operating by June 2003.
Central and South America
The hydroelectric resources of Central and South America have been widely developed. Many countries in the
region rely on hydropower for more than 70 percent of
their total electricity generation. Such heavy dependence on hydroelectric resources can be problematic
when a nation is faced with drought conditions. In the
2000-2001 period, for instance, Brazil experienced severe
droughts that threatened blackouts and electricity shortages. The government responded with mandatory conservation rules, which finally were lifted in the early part
of 2002, but the government also saw the urgency of
diversifying the electricity supply mix. Many South
American countries are working to develop naturalgas-fired electricity generation to lessen dependence on
hydroelectricity and the impact of future droughts on
their economies, but plans are also under way in the
region to expand hydroelectric power, as well as other
renewable energy sources. The IEO2003 reference case
projects 1.2-percent average annual growth in the
regions renewable energy use from 2001 through 2025
(Figure 73).
Brazil
A consortium led by Belgian energy company Tractebel
(and including Brazils Camargo Correa Energia, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billito, and U.S. Alcoa)
was successful in attaining the contract to build, own,
and operate the largest of the eight projects, the 1,087megawatt Estreito hydroelectric project in northern
Brazil [57]. Estreito is to be constructed on the Tocantins
River, on the border between the states of Tocantins and
Maranho. The first unit of the facility is scheduled to
begin operating in 2007. The consortium has a number of
other hydroelectric projects currently under construction, including the 300-megawatt Aimors, the
140-megawatt Candonga, and the 180-megawatt Funil,
all located in the southern state of Minas Gerais [58].
The expansion of Brazils hydroelectric power is expected to continue in 2003, when Aneel is expected to auction concessions for an additional 34 hydroelectric
energy stations [59]. The new power plants will add
9,100 megawatts of electricity capacity and require
investment of around $4 billion. Aneel has stated that
Brazils installed electric capacity increased by 6,244
megawatts in 2002 and will expand by another 15,709
megawatts in 2003 and 2004 and 4,675 megawatts in
2005, based on new hydroelectric plants that either are

Despite the fact that many parts of Brazil experienced
severe drought over the past 2 years, there are still plans
to add to the countrys hydroelectric capacity both in the
northwest, where the drought was less extreme than in
other parts of the country, and in the southeast, where
electricity demand is growing fastest. In July 2002,
Brazils power regulator Agncia Nacional de Energia
Elctrica (Aneel) awarded concessions to several foreign
and Brazilian consortia to construct and operate an
additional eight new hydroelectric power plants in the
northeast and central regions. The projects, adding 1,600
megawatts of capacity in five states, are expected to cost
approximately $1.2 billion [55]. Canadian aluminum
producer Alcan, Inc., won two concessions to build three
small plants [56]. Alcan is also constructing five other
small plants in Brazil, which should satisfy the companys 300-megawatt needs. Three of the new plants
should begin operating in 2006, another four in 2007,
and the last one in 2008.

20 new thermal power plants are expected to add 7,000
megawatts to the countrys electricity system by 2005.
Brazil is currently the worlds largest consumer and producer of ethanol from sugar cane, which is widely used
in the countrys automotive sector. Alcohol fuel use is a
legacy from the Procool program, which was created
by the government in response to the 1973-74 oil
embargo to lessen Brazils dependence on oil imports
and allow it to develop its own oil production and
reserves [60]. About 3 million older cars still in circulation in Brazil run on 100 percent ethanol (hydrous ethanol vehicles), and the all the countrys motor fuels
contain 25 percent ethanol. Only about 1 percent of all
the new cars sold in Brazil today are hydrous ethanol
vehicles; however, there is renewed government interest
in reviving the Procool program both for domestic consumption and to serve growing export markets. There is
a 10-year ethanol accord between Brazil and Germany,
under which Germany will receive carbon credits under
the terms of the Kyoto Protocol by paying for the production of 100,000 new hydrous ethanol cars.
The Brazilian government has also made substantial
efforts to encourage the development of wind-generated
electricity. In October 2002, only eight wind stations
were operating in Brazil, with a total capacity of 21.4
megawatts [61]; however, more than 5,100 megawatts of
new wind capacity has been approved for construction
by federal regulator Aneel. In 2001, Aneel approved 38
wind projects with a total of 3,337 megawatts of capacity, and by October 2002 another 29 projects had been
approved, with a combined capacity of 1,793 megawatts. The projects are sited in the Brazilian states of
Bahia, Cear, Pernambuco, Piau, Rio de Janeiro, and Rio
Grande do Norte. All the projects are scheduled to
become operational between 2002 and 2007; however,
their construction will depend on the ability of developers to obtain financing and purchase power agreements.
Over the past 2 years Brazil has taken a number of steps
to increase the use of alternative renewable energy
sources. In July 2001, in the midst of the electricity crisis
brought on by persistent drought, the Power Crisis Management Chamber established an emergency wind
energy program, Proelica, with the goal of adding 1,050
megawatts of wind capacity to the national grid by
December 2003. Under Proelica, the federal government guarantees a beneficial purchase of windgenerated electricity by state utility Eletrobras for at
least 15 years. Further, Brazils legislature passed Law
10.438 (or Proinfa) in April 2002, establishing incentives
for alternative electricity sources. In addition, the state
government of Rio de Janeiro passed a law in January
2002 that authorizes tax benefits for wind, solar, and biomass electricity generation projects [62]. The law also
encourages regional incentives for generation projects
that use nonhydroelectric renewable energy sources.
Other Central and South America
Despite economic and political problems in many countries of Central and South America, some renewable
energy projects have advanced in the region. Hydroelectric power still dominates the renewable energy picture
in the region. In Peru, new hydroelectric projects were
banned under the former Fujimori administration in an
effort to attract investment in the countrys Camisea natural gas fields. The ban was lifted by the Toledo administration, and a spate of new hydroelectric projects are
now under development in Peru. The country has 11
new hydroelectric dams currently planned or under
construction, at an estimated total cost of $1.5 billion. All
the projects are expected to be operational within the
next 6 years, adding some 1,500 megawatts of capacity
to the Peruvian electricity grid [63]. They include the
$304 million, 130-megawatt Yuncanthe only stateowned project among the elevenwhich is already
one-third complete and is scheduled to begin generating
electricity by July 2004. The project has been funded by
the Japanese government.
Other Peruvian hydroelectric projects include a 100megawatt project in the La Libertad region to be constructed by the Taruncani Generating Company; the
27-megawatt Poechos project to be constructed by
Sinersa near the Ecuadorian border; and the 270-megawatt El Platanal project to be built in Lima by Cementos
Lima. El Platanal is scheduled for completion in July
2006. Work on the 96-megawatt Maraon and 525megawatt Cheves hydropower projects is to be completed by February 2005 and November 2009,
respectively. The Peruvian privatization agency,
ProInvestment, is planning to auction the concession to
build and operate the 143-megawatt Olmos hydroelectric project on the Huancabamba River in Northern Peru
[64]. The project is expected to cost $245 million, with the
Peruvian government contributing $77 million to the
costs over the 3-year construction period.
There is increasing interest among several Central and
South American countries in developing their nonhydroelectric renewable energy resources. In September
2002, Colombian utility Empresas Pblicas de Medellin
(EPM) offered two tenders for the construction of the
20-megawatt Jepirachi wind project in the Guajira province on the Atlantic coast [65]. Jepirachi is scheduled for
completion by October 2003 [66]. The $21.5 million project will be the first developed by Colombia under the
provisions of the Kyoto Protocols Clean Development
Mechanism, with the backing of the World Banks Prototype Carbon Fund. Launched in 2000, the Prototype
Carbon Fund is a mutual fund that invests in clean technologies in developing countries and in the EE/FSU.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Resulting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are to
be verified and then transferred to the funds contributors in the form of emissions reduction certificates that
may be used by the contributors to meet their emissions
targets under the Kyoto Protocol.
Geothermal energy is also being increasingly exploited
in the Central and South America region. Countries in
the region added some 242 megawatts of geothermal
generating capacity between 1990 and 2000, more than
doubling the use of geothermal energy from its 1990
level of 165 megawatts [67]. There are plans to expand
Nicaraguas geothermal capacity beyond the current
level of 70 megawatts. In 2002 construction began on a
$140 million geothermal project near Leon, about 56
miles northwest of Managua [68]. The San Jacinto-Tizate
steam field will be the countrys first fully private geothermal power facility. The first phase of the project consists of a 10-megawatt pilot plant, which will eventually
be expanded to 66 megawatts.
El Salvador is also expanding its geothermal capacity,
adding 38 megawatts of capacity. Italys Enel GreenPower has entered into a joint venture with El Salvadors
state-owned geothermal generator, Gesal, to develop
the project at an estimated cost of $91 million. Gesal currently operates two geothermal plants in El Salvador,
the 95-megawatt Ahuachapn and the 66-megawatt
Berln.
Developing Asia
In developing Asia, much of the development of renewable resources is expected to center on increasing the
amount of mid- to large-scale hydroelectric capacity.
The region has some of the worlds largest hydroelectric
facilities either planned or under construction. China
has particularly ambitious plans to increase hydroelectric capacity, including the 18,200-megawatt Three
Gorges Dam project and the 5,400-megawatt Longtan
project, both of which are under construction [69]. Other
countries in the region, including Vietnam, Malaysia,
and India, also have plans to expand their use of
large-scale hydroelectricity over the next decade in an
effort to diversify electricity sources and meet the rapidly growing demand for new electricity to fuel their
expanding economies. Consumption of hydroelectricity
and other renewables is expected to more than double
among the nations of developing Asia, from 5.1 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 11.0 quadrillion Btu in 2025 (Figure
74).
In November 2002, work on the Three Gorges Dam project reached a significant milestone with the successful
blocking of the Yangtze River [71]. The rivers waters are
now being channeled through diversion holes in the
partially completed dam. The dams reservoir is scheduled to begin to be filled in early 2003. By the end of 2003,
the project is expected to begin generating electricity
with the installation of the first four 700-megawatt generators [72]. Three Gorges Dam is expected to become
fully operational in 2009.
Several additional hydroelectric projects are now being
developed in China. The Yellow River Hydro Electric
Corporation is developing 25 hydropower projects on
the Yellow River with a combined 15,800 megawatts of
installed electricity capacity [73]. In addition to Three
Gorges, the Chinese government has several other
large-scale hydroelectric projects either under construction or in the planning stages. In July 2001, construction
began on the 5,400-megawatt Longtan project on the
Hongshui River, which is expected to begin operating
in 2007. Other large-scale projects under construction

Over the next decade, China has extensive plans to
expand its hydroelectric capacity above the current
79,000 megawatts of installed capacity. The Three
Gorges Dam project remains the largest and most ambitious hydropower project currently under construction.
With the displacement of more than a million people
living around the construction site and destruction of
significant architectural sites, it is also among the most
controversial projects in the world today. Despite criticism from the international community, the Chinese
government has been adamant in its pursuit of the
18,200-megawatt project, which will cost $25 billion or
more to complete [70]. The government argues that the
dam is needed both to provide electricity to meet rapidly
growing demand in the countrys urban areas and to
control devastating flooding along the Yangtze River.

include the 1,350-megawatt Dachaoshan hydroelectric
project, scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003,
and the 4,200-megawatt Xiaowan project, scheduled to
be completed in 2012. Both are located on the Mekong
River. Proposals have been submitted for the 14,000megawatt Xiluodo project (on the upper portion of the
Yangtze River, known locally as the Jinsha River);
6,000-megawatt Xiangjiaba project (Jinsha River);
5,000-megawatt Nuozhadu project (Mekong River); and
1,500-megawatt Jinghong project (Mekong River) [74].
In addition to the hydroelectric expansion taking place
in China, there has also been some progress in installing
alternative, nonhydroelectric renewable energy sources.
The government has instituted a number of programs to
increase the use of nonhydroelectric renewables. The
Brightness Program was launched in 1996 to encourage
the use of solar panels and wind turbines for electricity
generation with low-cost loans. Pilot projects under the
program have been set up in the regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Tibet. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide electricity from these sources to 8
million people by 2005 and to 23 million people by 2010.
In an effort to boost interest in wind-powered electricity
generation, the Chinese government has announced that
it will cut the value-added tax on wind-generated electricity by half, reducing the average cost of wind generation by between $6 and $7 per megawatthour. Wind
projects have also found funding from international
sources that are interested in reducing Chinas dependence on coal use. The Asia Development Bank is providing loans worth some $58 million to erect wind projects
in Xinjiang, Liaong and Heilongjiang provinces. One of
the projects is a 200-megawatt wind farm in Xinjiang
that will be Chinas largest wind installation upon completion in 2003 [75]. Another project to be funded with
foreign investment is the 100-megawatt Hulai
Shipaishan wind project in Guangdong province [76].
Tenders for the $120 million project were offered by
local government authorities in Hulai county.
India
At present, India has 25,140 megawatts of installed
hydroelectric capacity[77]. With an overall development
potential of 84,000 megawatts, there are ample resources
still to be exploited [78]. Numerous government-funded
hydropower projects are under construction throughout
the country, including the 1,500-megawatt Nathpa
Jhakri project in Himachal Pradesh state and the
1,000-megawatt Tehri project in Uttar Pradesh. At the
end of 2001 India announced that it would revive construction of the $1.2 billion Tehri hydroelectric dam project [79]. The final two tunnels associated with the first
phase of the project were scheduled for completion in
December 2002, and Tehri should begin supplying electricity in August 2003 [80]. There are additional plans to
expand Tehris capacity to 2,000 megawatts in subsequent phases, but no work beyond the initial phase has
been approved.
A number of smaller hydroelectric facilities have also
been approved for construction in India. In Himachal
Pradesh the government awarded private power developers permission to construct eight hydroelectric projects in 2002 [81]. The projects range in size from the
10.5-megawatt Baragaon project to the 100-megawatt
Malana II and Sainji projects. The government of
Himachal Pradesh has announced its intention to
develop 20,000 megawatts of its hydroelectric potential.
As of 2002, 3,900 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity
had been installed in the state, with another 6,800 megawatts under construction.
Other Developing Asia
Vietnam has recognized the need to increase its electricity generation in order to power its growth in industrial
production and gross domestic product, which have
been expanding by 6 to 7 percent annually in recent
years. Hydroelectricity is expected to make a large contribution toward meeting the increased demand for electricity. The state-owned Electricit de Vietnam (EVN)
has announced plans to add 37 new electric power
plants by 2020, to the existing 18 power plants [82].
Twenty-two of the planned power projects are hydroelectric plants, and the rest are to be fueled by oil, natural
gas, and coal. EVN has announced its intention to fund
approximately one-third of the investment needed to
construct the new projects, with the rest to come from
private and foreign investment.
In 2002, Vietnams second largest hydroelectric project
(after the Hoa Binh project), the 720-megawatt Yaly Falls
became fully operational [83]. The $546 million project,
located on the Se San River in the central part of the
country, is expected to supply about 10 percent of Vietnams total electricity generation. The 475-megawatt
Ham Thuan/Da Mi hydroelectric project in the southern
part of the country is also nearly completed [84]. In 2002,
construction began on the 300-megawatt Dai Ninh in the
central province of Lam Dong and the 300-megawatt Se
San in the central province of Gia Lai. Construction is
expected to begin by March 2003 on the 324-megawatt
Na Hang hydroelectric project [85]. The $500 million
project is scheduled to begin generating electricity in
2006 and to be fully operational by 2007. Finally, in
October 2002, the Vietnamese government gave final
approval for construction of the 2,400-megawatt Son La
hydroelectric project, which will become the countrys
largest hydroelectric facility [86]. Construction on the
$1.7 billion project is expected to begin in 2004 and to be
completed in 2012.
In 2002, Laos made some progress in reviving construction on the controversial Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
project. Construction of the 920-megawatt, $1.2 billion
project has been delayed since 1997, pending a trade
agreement between Laos and Thailand on the output
from the project [87]. Electricity produced by Nam
Theun was originally to be sold exclusively to Thailand,
which has offered to sign an initial 13-year power purchasing agreement with Laos after indicating that it cannot support the original 25-year agreement for the
electricity from the project. In 2002, a consortium led by
Electricit de France was awarded a build-operatetransfer contract for Nam Theun 2. If the Laotian and
Thai governments are able to finalize a power purchase
agreement, Nam Theun 2 could be in operation by 2008
[88].
The Malaysian government in 2002 reiterated its commitment to develop its hydroelectric resources, citing
the countrys need to diversify the electricity fuel mix
away from an overreliance on natural-gas-fired generation. State-owned utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd completed construction of the 600-megawatt Sultan Ismail
Petra dam in the northern state of Kelantan in 2002 and
is considering a 1,000-megawatt project in Pahang state.
The controversial 2,400-megawatt Bakun hydroelectric
project also progressed slightly in 2002. The main construction contract for the project was awarded to the
Malaysian company, Sime Engineering in September,
and in October a consortium was formed to supply
materials and services to support construction of the
$3.6 billion project [89].
The Bakun project has been the subject of much controversy since it was conceived in the 1980s, both because of
its cost and because of its potential impact on the environment. The project was scaled back in 1998, during the
Asian economic crisis, which made the project too
expensive to pursue given the drop in electricity
demand associated with the recession. In 2001, however,
the government announced that it had reconsidered,
and the project was returned to its originally planned
capacity [90]. Environmentalists argue that the reservoir
required to supply water to Bakun will mean that an
area the size of Singapore will have to be flooded, displacing as many as 15 villages of the indigenous Iban
people in Sarawak state and destroying the habitat of up
to 100 endangered species [91].
Among the countries of developing Asia there has also
been some recent interest in developing renewable
energy sources other than hydropower. South Korea
and Taiwan, for instance, have expressed increasing
interest in developing their wind resources. In 2002 the
South Korean government announced that it had
approved plans to construct a 99-megawatt wind project
on the countrys east cost at Daekwanryung in Kangwon
province [92]. The $110 million project is to be constructed in two phases, the first consisting of 28.5 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be completed by July 2004
and the second phase consisting of 70.5 megawatts of
capacity to be completed by November 2005. A second
6-megawatt project is planned for construction by
state-owned Korea Southern Power. It will be sited at
Yongsuri on the island of Cheju. Construction was
scheduled to begin in March 2003 and to be completed
by April 2003 at an estimated cost of $12.3 million.
Another 150-megawatt, $230 million multi-phase wind
project funded by local and national government organizations is also under construction on Cheju, with final
completion scheduled for 2006.
The government of Taiwan has established a goal of
installing up to 1,500 megawatts of wind capacity
by 2020 [93]. State-owned Taiwan Power Company
announced in 2002 that it would invest $144 million in
wind power projects between 2002 and 2007. At the end
of 2001, the company completed a $4.3 million, 2.4megawatt wind power project on Penghu Island. It has
also announced plans to install up to 80 megawatts of
wind capacity in Taichung county.
Industrialized Asia
The extent to which available renewable resources are
currently exploited in the industrialized nations of Asia
(Australia, Japan, and New Zealand) varies substantially. In New Zealand, for example, more than twothirds of the countrys electricity needs are met by
renewable energy sourcesmostly hydroelectricity and
geothermal. In contrast, Australia meets most of its electricity demand with thermal generation, predominantly
from coal; and in Japan almost all of the countrys electricity is supplied from thermal sources and nuclear
power. Hydroelectricity and other renewable energy
consumption in the region is projected to grow by 1.7
percent per year between 2001 and 2025 (Figure 75), to
12 percent of the regions total energy use in the electric
power sector by 2025.
Japan
With an electricity market dominated by thermal and
nuclear generation, the growth in Japans renewable
energy resources has been fairly slow. Fossil fuels (oil,
natural gas, and coal) account for 70 percent of Japans
total installed generating capacity and nuclear another
20 percent.
There have been some efforts by the Japanese government to increase the penetration of nonhydroelectric
renewables in the country. The Law on Special Measures
for Promotion of Utilization of New Energy (the New
Energy Law), which entered into force in mid-1997,
included provisions to encourage the development of
wind-powered electricity generation in the country [94].
Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. If the Protocol
enters into force, Japan will be required to reduce its
output of greenhouse gases by 6 percent relative to
its 1990 emissions level between 2008 and 2012. These
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
developments may provide an opportunity for increased development of the countrys renewable energy
sources. Indeed, although Japans wind capacity increased by only 31 megawatts between 1989 and 1998, its
installed wind capacity grew by nearly 40 megawatts in
1999, by 50 megawatts in 2000, and by another 40 megawatts in 2001.
Australia
The Australian government introduced the Mandated
Renewable Energy Target in 2001, decreeing that electricity retailers and large power purchases must increase
the renewable share of their electricity mix by an additional 2 percent before 2010 [95]. The Renewable Energy
(Electricity) Act of 2000 specifies a number of interim
yearly targets over the 2001-2020 time period. As a result
of the new legislation, wind energy projects are receiving new interest, and a number of wind projects were
either planned or under construction in 2002. In August,
the Victoria state government approved the Australian
company Pacific Hydros plans for developing a
180-megawatt wind farm at Portland [96]. In November,
Pacific Hydro also confirmed its plans to construct a
100-megawatt wind project in northwest Tasmania [97].
Another Pacific Hydro wind project is currently under
construction at Challicum Hills, near Ararat [98]. The
53-megawatt wind facility is expected to cost an estimated $76 million and is scheduled for completion by
mid-2003.
Several other companies are entering the Australian
wind market. The New Zealand electricity generator
and retailer Trustpower has announced plans to construct a 60-megawatt wind project near Myponga on the
Figure 75. Renewable Energy Consumption

Projections
Australia/New Zealand
Japan
Fleurieu peninsula of South Australia [99], which will be
the companys first venture in Australia. The startup of
construction on the $55 million project is pending
approval from the state Development Assessment Commission. A second 35-megawatt wind project is already
being built by Australias Tarong Energy on the Fleurieu
peninsula at Starfish Hill. Tarong received government
approval for the project in April 2002. The $36 million
project is scheduled to begin operating in April 2003.
The Indian-based company Ausker Energies is developing the Tungketta wind project, which is to be constructed on the Eyre peninsula of South Australia [100].
The first phase of the project will consist of 49.5 megawatts of wind capacity, with subsequent phases
that could increase capacity to between 115 and 200
megawatts.
There are also several projects under consideration for
New South Wales. Australian energy developer Michelago is planning to construct a 30-megawatt wind project near Goulburn in the Southern Highlands region of
New South Wales. In addition, Wind Corporation of
Australia has proposed building a $14 million, 20-megawatt wind project at Black Springs near Oberon [101].
New Zealand
New Zealand has already extensively exploited its
renewable energy resources. The country relies on
renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectricity,
for nearly 70 percent of its total electricity supply [102].
Geothermal energy sources in New Zealand are also
widely established, and installed geothermal capacity
has grown by 54 percent over the past decade, reaching
437 megawatts in 2000, according to the Geothermal
Energy Association [103].
Development of New Zealands wind power resources
has been lackluster by comparison. At the end of 2001,
slightly more than 35 megawatts of wind capacity had
been installed at three sites, the latest of which became
operational in 1999 [104]. There is some hope that the
release of the governments National Energy Efficiency
and Conservation Strategy, which calls for increasing
the renewable share of total energy supply by an additional 19 percent (to 42 percent) by 2012, will help spur
an increase in wind-generated electricity.

For the most part, hydroelectricity and other renewable
energy resources have not been widely exploited in
Africa or the Middle East. Most of the hydroelectric
power projects in the Middle East are located in Turkey
and Iran. In Africa, the largest installed hydroelectric
capacities are in Egypt and Congo (Kinshasa). Several
African countriesincluding Ivory Coast, Kenya, and
Zimbabwerely almost exclusively on hydropower for
commercial electricity generation; however, it is because
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
of the absence of an electricity infrastructure in these and
many other African countries rather than the presence of
an extensive hydroelectric system. Other, nonhydroelectric renewable energy resources are also used in
Africa and the Middle East, primarily to serve small,
rural communities that are not served by national electric power grids. Renewable energy consumption in
Africa and the Middle East is expected to increase from
1.2 quadrillion Btu in 2001 to 2.3 quadrillion Btu in 2025
(Figure 76).
For many nations in Africa, future hydroelectric projects
may depend on the ability to attract investment dollars.
Because large-scale hydroelectric projects are often controversial, many traditional funding sources for hydropower developmentparticularly, the World Bank but
also many import-export banks that are needed by
developers to guarantee loans in areas that have a high
risk of defaulting on agreementshave increasingly
decided against providing financial aid to governments
that wish to pursue them.
One example of the hesitancy of international financing
sources to fund hydroelectric power projects is the
200-megawatt Bujagali Dam at the Bujagali Falls on the
Nile River in Uganda. U.S.-based AES Corporation
announced plans to construct the $550 million project in
1994 [105] and by December 2001 had secured funding
commitments from the World Bank, International
Finance Corporation, African Development Bank,
Wesdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, and Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, with export
credit guarantees obtained from several European
Banks. The argument for lending financial support to

the construction of the Bujagali Dam was that the electricity was desperately needed in a country where less
than 5 percent of the populace has access to electricity.
However, international environmental groups have
countered that the project would submerge a number of
local cultural sites and displace more than 90 households [106]. In June 2002, with allegations of corruption
surrounding the bidding process for Bujagali, the World
Bank postponed its decision to approve $250 million in
loan guarantees. The Ugandan government has vowed
to continue with the project, but no schedule has yet
been announced for the 4-year effort.
Similar problems have beset the Sondu Miriu hydroelectric project in Kenya. Originally conceived in 1985 as a
multiple-purpose system of dams, the project was substantially scaled back, and in 1989 the Kenya Power
Company, Ltd. (now the Kenya Electricity Generating
Company, Ltd., or KenGen) obtained funding from the
Japanese government [107]. Funding for the first phase
of the $150 million project was provided in 1997, and
construction on the 60-megawatt dam began with an
original completion date of March 2003 [108]. Concerns
over human rights violations and the impact of the project on the environment led the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation to delay releasing funds for the
second phase of the project, however, and now completion is not expected before 2005 [109].
It took some 13 years to complete the 200-megawatt
Manantali hydroelectric project in southwestern Mali,
adding transmission lines to the hydropower project
that had been completed in 1987. Funding problems and
disputes among the three countriesMali, Senegal, and
Mauritaniathat share the Senegal River, where the
project is located, delayed completion of the project. By
some estimates the project cost almost $1 billionfar
more than the original budget. Funding to complete the
project was finally provided by the World Bank and
other international donors in 2002, and it was scheduled
to begin supplying electricity to the three countries
involved by the end of 2002. Electricity from the project
is to go to Mali (52 percent), Mauritania (15 percent), and
Senegal (33 percent), with plans to expand electricity
exports to other West African countries, including Togo,
Benin, and Ghana.
Several other hydropower projects are either planned or
under construction in Africa. Construction of the
300-megawatt Tekeze hydroelectric project in Ethiopia
began in 2002 [110]. The $224 million project is the largest African joint venture with China; the China National
Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation is building the 607-foot dam, which will be higher
than Chinas own Three Gorges Dam. The project,
expected to be completed by 2007, will supply both electricity and water for irrigation to large parts of northern
Ethiopia.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Construction continued on the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project in the southern African kingdom of
Lesotho. The project has received $106 million from the
World Bank for completion, including a 72-megawatt
hydroelectric station as one part of the system [111]. The
project has faced delays, mostly because of corruption
allegations and issues surrounding the resettlement
agreement with the population to be affected by the construction of a reservoir, but in October 2002 the
impoundment of the Mohale Reservoir started, marking
the final step of construction in the first phase of the
water project [112].
Mozambique plans to construct the Mepanda Uncua
hydroelectric project, which will be located about 45
miles downstream from the existing 3,750-megawatt
Cahora Bassa dam on the Zambezi River [113]. Much of
the output from Cahora Bassa is exported to South
Africa and Zimbabwe, and with growing demand for
electricity Mozambique believes that the new Mepanda
Uncua project will be essential for the country to meet its
needs. The cost of the project has been estimated at $1.8
billion. The construction is two be completed in two
phases, adding 1,300 megawatts in the first phase and
another 1,100 megawatts in the second phase. The government is currently pursuing potential investors for the
project and plans to begin construction in 2005.
Sudan is also pressing forward with plans to construct
the Hamdab hydroelectric dam in Merowe, about 250
miles north of Khartoum [114]. The 1,250-megawatt project, which would triple electricity generation in Sudan,
would take 6 years to complete. In 2002 the Sudanese
government began the process of accepting bids for construction of Hamdab; however, it is unclear when construction might actually begin, given the economic
disrepair of the country, which has suffered from a
19-year civil war.
Some nonhydroelectric renewable energy projects are
also advancing in Africa. Egypt, for instance, has
become the largest wind-generating country in the
region and predicted that its installed wind power
capacity could increase to 150 megawatts in 2002 [115].
The countrys New and Renewable Energy Authority
has undertaken the construction of a 60-megawatt wind
farm at Zafarana in northern Egypt. The Egyptian government has stated its intention to change all oil-fired
power plants to natural gas and is also looking at the
potential for solar and wind generation to supplement
electricity supplies. Morocco is also considered one of
the more important markets for wind generation in
Africa. The country has installed multiple wind projects,
ranging from a few kilowatts up to 50 megawatts in size
[116].
There is growing interest in the potential for alternative
renewable energy markets in Africa. For instance, in July
2002 the Chinese-based company Shenzhen Topway
Solar announced its intention to transfer its manufacturing base to Africa [117], stating that the move was desirable because the region is currently considering locating
its base either in Nairobi (Kenya) or Kampala (Uganda)
before 2004. The company currently supplies solar products to 15 African countries.
In the Middle East, hydroelectric development is centered primarily in Turkey. There area already more than
100 hydroelectric plants operating in the country, contributing 11,000 megawatts of the total Turkish installed
electric capacity of 26,000 megawatts. The country has
plans to continue developing its hydroelectric resources.
It is currently constructing the massive Southeast
Anatolia Project (called GAP), which includes portions for hydroelectric generation and irrigation [118].
The $32 billion project includes 21 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants that will add around 7,500 megawatts of
installed generating capacity upon completion.
The largest dams to be constructed as part of GAP
include the 2,400-megawatt Ataturk, the 1,800-megawatt Karakaya, and the 1,200-megawatt Ilisu. When
completed, Ilisu would be the largest hydroelectric project on the Tigris River. British civil engineering company Balfour Beatty withdrew from the Ilisu project in
November 2001 when the UK Export Credit Guarantee
Department indicated that it would withdraw its support for the dam under considerable pressure concerning the impact the dam would have both on the
environment and on the people who would have to be
relocated to construct Ilisu [119]. More than 60,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, would be displaced by the construction. In a similar development, the British
engineering company AMEC decided in March 2002 to
withdraw from the Yusefeli dam project in Turkey [120].
The company denied that it had withdrawn because of
the experience of Balfour Beatty, citing its conclusion
that the project would not yield sufficient returns to justify AMECs continued participation.
Several hydroelectric projects are moving forward in
Turkey. In 1998, the United States and Turkey signed a
joint statement on hydroelectric development that
includes provisions for construction of nine dams [121],
including the $337 million Alpasian II to be constructed
on the Murat River in eastern Turkey. The U.S. company
Earth Tech signed a contract with the State Hydraulic
Works of Turkey for the design phase of the 200megawatt project, which will include an irrigation
component.

Electricity consumption nearly doubles in the IEO2003 projections.
Developing nations in Asia and in Central and South America
are expected to lead the increase in world electricity use.
rural populations that previously have not had access to
the national grid.
In the International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) reference case, worldwide electricity consumption is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent
from 2001 to 2025 (Table 22 and Figure 77). The most
rapid projected growth in electricity use by region is 3.7
percent per year for developing Asia, where robust economic growth is expected to increase demand for electricity to run newly purchased home appliances for air
conditioning, refrigeration, cooking, and space and
water heating. By 2025, developing Asia as a whole is
expected to consume almost 2.5 times as much electricity
as it did in 2001. In China, electricity consumption is projected to grow by an average of 4.3 percent per year,
nearly tripling over the forecast period.
Primary Fuel Use for Electricity
Generation
In Central and South America, as in developing Asia,
high rates of economic growth are expected to improve
standards of living and increase electricity use for industrial processes and in homes and businesses. The
expected growth rate for electricity use in Central and
South America is 3.3 percent per year. In Brazil, the
regions largest economy and largest consumer of electricity, electricity consumption is projected to increase
by 3.2 percent per year, with electrification coming to
The mix of primary fuels used to generate electricity has
changed a great deal over the past three decades on a
worldwide basis. Coal has remained the dominant fuel,
although electricity generation from nuclear power
increased rapidly from the 1970s through the mid-1980s,
and natural-gas-fired generation has grown rapidly in
the 1980s and 1990s. In contrast, in conjunction with the
high world oil prices brought on by the oil price shocks
resulting from the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 and
Electricity consumption in the industrialized world is
expected to grow at a more modest pace than in the
developing world, at 1.7 percent per year. In addition to
expected slower growth in population and economic
activity in the industrialized nations, market saturation
and efficiency gains for some electronic appliances are
expected to slow the growth of electricity consumption
from historical rates.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the use of oil for electricity generation has been slowing since the mid-1970s.
In the IEO2003 reference case, continued increases in the
use of natural gas for electricity generation are expected
worldwide. Coal is projected to continue to retain the
largest market share of electricity generation, but its
importance is expected to be diminished somewhat by
the rise in natural gas use. The role of nuclear power in
the worlds electricity markets is projected to lessen as
reactors in industrialized nations reach the end of their
lifespans and few new reactors are expected to replace
them. Generation from hydropower and other renewable energy sources is projected to grow by 56 percent
over the next 24 years, but their share of total electricity
generation is projected to remain near the current level
of 21 percent.
Natural Gas
Electricity markets of the future are expected to depend
increasingly on natural-gas-fired generation. Industrialized nations are intent upon using combined-cycle gas
turbines, which usually are cheaper to construct and
more efficient to operate than other fossil-fuel-fired generation. Natural gas is also seen as a much cleaner fuel
than other fossil fuels. Worldwide, natural gas use for
electricity generation is projected to be almost 2.5 times
greater in 2025 than it was in 2001 (Table 23), as technologies for natural-gas-fired generation continue to
improve and ample gas reserves are exploited. In the
developing world, natural gas is expected to be used to
diversify electricity fuel sources, particularly in Central
and South America, where heavy reliance on hydroelectric power has led to shortages and blackouts during
periods of severe drought.

iea/. Projections: EIA, System for the Analysis of Global
Energy Markets (2003).
The former Soviet Union (FSU) accounted for more than
one-third of natural gas usage for electricity generation
worldwide in 2001, and natural gas provided 42 percent
of the energy used for electricity generation in the FSU.
By 2025, natural gas is projected to account for 63 percent of the electricity generation market in the FSU.
Relying increasingly on imports from Russia, the
nations of Eastern Europe are also expected to increase
their use of natural gas for electricity generation, from a
9-percent share of total generation in 2001 to 50 percent
in 2025.
In North America, the natural gas share of the electricity
fuel market in the United States is projected to increase
from 18 percent in 2001 to 24 percent in 2025, with Canadian exports expected to provide a growing supply of
natural gas to U.S. generators. The natural gas share of
electricity generation in Canada is also projected to
grow, from 3 percent in 2001 to 11 percent in 2025.
Natural gas consumption for electricity generation in
Western Europe is projected to nearly triple over the
forecast period, and its share of the regions electricity
fuel market is projected to grow from 17 percent in 2001
to 38 percent in 2025 as the nuclear power and coal
shares are reduced. After the oil crisis of 1973, European
nations actively discouraged the use of natural gas for
electricity generation (as did the United States) and
instead favored domestic coal and nuclear power over
dependence on natural gas imports. In 1975 a European
Union (EU) directive restricted the use of natural gas in
new power plants. The natural gas share of the electricity market in Western Europe fell from 9 percent in 1977
to 5 percent in 1981, where it remained for most of the
1980s. In the early 1990s, the growing availability of
reserves from the North Sea and increased imports from
Russia and North Africa lessened concerns about gas
supply in the region, and the EU directive was repealed.
In Central and South America natural gas accounted for
9 percent of the electricity fuel market in 2001. Its share is
projected to grow to 46 percent in 2025. Hydropower is
the major source of electricity supply in South America
at present, but environmental concerns, cost overruns
on large hydropower projects in the past, and electricity
shortfalls during periods of drought have prompted
South American governments to view natural gas as a
means of diversifying their electricity supplies. A continent-wide natural gas pipeline system is being built in
South America, which will transport Argentine and
Bolivian gas to Chile and Brazil.
Per capita consumption of natural gas in Asia and Africa
is relatively small when compared with Europe and
North America. In 2001, Japan accounted for one-fourth
of natural gas consumption in Asia. Almost all natural
gas consumed in Japan is imported as liquefied natural
gas (LNG). Japan is expected to maintain its dependence
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
on natural gas at around 20 percent of the electricity fuel
market through 2025.
Coal
In 2025, coal is expected to account for 31 percent of the
worlds electricity fuel market, slightly lower than its
34-percent share in 2001. The United States accounted
for 40 percent of all coal use for electricity generation in
2001, and China and India together accounted for 27 percent. In the IEO2003 forecast, the coal share of U.S. electricity generation is expected to remain at roughly 50
percent through 2025. Chinas coal share is projected to
rise slightly, to 73 percent in 2025 from 72 percent in
2001. Over the same period, coals share of Indias electricity market is expected to decline from 72 percent to
63 percent. Although coal remains a relatively cheap
source of electricity production, natural gas is viewed as
being environmentally superior, and the economics of
natural gas generation technology are improving, particularly in countries with access to gas pipelines.
Reliance on coal for electricity generation is also
expected to be reduced in other regions. In Western
Europe, for example, coal accounted for 20 percent of the
electricity fuel market in 2001 but is projected to have
only a 12-percent share in 2025. Similarly, in Eastern
Europe and the FSU (EE/FSU), coals 27-percent share
of the electricity fuel market in 2001 is projected to fall to
6 percent in 2025. For years, massive state subsidies were
all that kept many coal mines operating in Western and
Eastern Europe. In many cases, the subsidies were
underwritten by electricity consumers. The EU has
adopted policy measures to eliminate or reduce state
subsidies for domestic coal production, and only four
EU member states (the United Kingdom, Germany,
Spain, and France) continue to produce hard coal.
Nuclear Power
The nuclear share of energy use for electricity production is expected to decline in most regions of the world
as a result of public opposition, waste disposal issues,

concerns about nuclear arms proliferation, and the economics of nuclear power. The nuclear share of electricity
generation worldwide is projected to drop to 12 percent
in 2025 from 19 percent in 2001.
In the United States, the nuclear share is projected to
decline from 19 percent of the electricity fuel market in
2001 (second behind coal) to 15 percent in 2025. In Canada, where the nuclear share of the market has been
declining since 1984, its 22-percent share in 2001 is projected to fall to 11 percent in 2025. In Western Europe,
where Finland is the only country projected to build new
nuclear units, the nuclear share of the regions electricity
fuel market is projected to fall from 34 percent in
2001more than any other energy sourceto 21 percent in 2025.
In Japan, nuclear power accounted for 39 percent of the
energy used for electricity generation in 2001. That share
is expected to decline to 31 percent by 2025 in the
IEO2003 forecast. In the EE/FSU region, the nuclear
share is projected to decline from 18 percent in 2001 to 10
percent in 2025.
Nuclear power contributes very little to electricity generation in the developing nations of Central and South
America, Africa, and the Middle East, and it is expected
to contribute little in 2025. In Central and South America, only Argentina and Brazil were nuclear power producers in 2001. In Africa, only South Africa generated
electricity from nuclear power in 2001. There are no
nuclear power plants in operation in the Middle East,
although two are under construction in Iran.
In contrast to the rest of the worlds regions, in developing Asia nuclear power is expected to play a growing
role in electricity generation. China, India, Pakistan,
South Korea, and Taiwan currently have nuclear power
programs, and the nuclear share of the regions electricity fuel market is expected to remain stable at roughly 9
percent from 2001 through 2025. China is expected to
account for most of the regions nuclear power capacity
additions.
Hydroelectricity and Other Renewables
Renewable energy, predominantly hydropower,
accounted for one-fifth of the worlds energy use for
electricity generation in 2001, where it is expected to
remain through 2025. Of the worlds consumption of
renewable energy for electricity production in 2001, the
United States and Canada together accounted for almost
29 percent of the total, Western Europe for 20 percent,
and Central and South America 19 percent (despite consuming just 5 percent of the worlds electricity).
In 2001, renewables accounted for 9 percent of electricity
production in the United States and 56 percent in Canada, both nations where hydroelectric power has been
extensively developed. Their shares are expected to
grow slightly by 2025. In North America and throughout
the world, generation technologies using nonhydroelectric renewables are expected to improve over the
forecast period, but they still are expected to be relatively expensive in the low price environment assumed
for energy fuels in the IEO2003 reference case.
Hydroelectricity is used the most for electricity generation in Central and South America, and renewables
accounted for 73 percent of the regions electricity fuel
market in 2001. Recent experiences with drought, cost
overruns, and the negative environmental impacts of
several large-scale hydroelectric projects have reduced
the appeal of hydropower in South America, however,
and the renewable share of electricity generation in the
region is expected to decline to 45 percent by 2025 as
countries work to diversify their electricity fuel mix.
Most of Western Europes renewable energy consumption consists of hydroelectricity. Renewables in total
accounted for 24 percent of the regions electricity market in 2001, and their share is expected to increase to 25
percent in 2025. Some European nations, particularly
Denmark and Germany, are actively developing their
nonhydroelectric renewable energy resources, most
notably wind.
Some near-term growth in renewable energy use is
expected in developing Asia, particularly in China,
where the 18,200-megawatt Three Gorges Dam and a
number of other major hydropower projects are
expected to become operational during the forecast
period. Developing Asia relied on renewables for 18 percent of its electricity production in 2001, and that share is
expected to shrink slightly, to 16 percent in 2025.
The role of oil in the worlds electricity generation market has been on the decline since the 1979 oil price shock.
Oil accounted for 23 percent of electricity fuel use in
1977; in 2001 its share stood at 7 percent. Energy security
concerns, as well as environmental considerations, have
already led most nations to reduce their use of oil for
electricity generation. In regions where oil continues to
hold a significant share of the generation fuel market,
such as the FSU and the Middle East, it generally is
expected to maintain its position. As a result, the oil
share of world energy use for electricity production is
projected to remain stable at between 6 and 7 percent
through 2025.
Developing Asia accounted for 18 percent of the worlds
consumption of oil for electricity generation in 2001,
when 7 percent of its electricity fuel use consisted of oil
(down from 29 percent in 1977). The oil share of electricity fuel consumption in developing Asia is expected
to remain stable through 2025. In the petroleum-rich
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Middle East, oil supplied 38 percent of the energy used
for electricity generation in 2001, and its share is projected to decline slightly, to 34 percent in 2025.
Foreign Investment in Electricity
In the mid- to late 1990s, a massive amount of U.S. capital crossed oceans to acquire electricity assets. Those
mergers and acquisitions gave rise to the multinational
electricity company. U.S. capital investment targeted
nations and regions that were engaged in electricity
reforms, which often included privatization and
removal of restrictions on foreign investment. Major targets included South America, Australia, and the United
Kingdom. Large amounts of non-U.S. foreign capital
also flowed into those electricity markets, particularly
from Europe.
Over the past few years, the flow of foreign capital into
South American electricity ventures has stalled. The
same is true of the outflow of U.S. capital into Western
Europe and Australia. The slowdown was in part caused
by the sluggish state of the global economy and a reduction in international capital flows24 in general [1], as well
as the disappointing financial performance of many earlier electricity acquisitions. U.S. companies in particular
have retreated from several markets which they quickly
grew to dominate in the late 1990s, such as Australia and
the United Kingdom, in many instances citing disappointing financial results as a cause for the departure.
Domestically, the United States saw a major wave of
mergers and acquisitions in electricity through much of
the 1990s, giving rise to electricity producers with a
national presence. Some mergers and acquisitions also
involved more vertical integration among energy companies. Several involved both natural gas and electricity
producers, leading to a greater convergence between
electricity fuel producers and electricity generators. U.S.
mergers and acquisitions peaked in 1999, however, and
have since slowed to a trickle. During the 1990s many
mergers and acquisitions were financed through equity
swaps. The weakness in equity markets for roughly the
past 2 years may have forestalled further consolidation
of the U.S. electricity industry.
Many developing countries, particularly in Asia and
South America, opened their electricity sectors to private capital, much of which came from overseas investors, in the 1990s. Growing foreign investment provided
an important source of capital for the construction of
new generating capacity to meet rapidly growing electricity demand. Those investments peaked in 1997, and
by 2001 they were only about one-fifth of their 1997
levels.
In contrast, continental Europe has only recently seen a
wave of merger and investment activity, both internally
and across borders. In 1996, the then 15 members of the
EU adopted an electricity directive, which became effective in 1997 [2]. The goal of the directive was to establish
a single European electricity market. Recent merger and
acquisition activities on the continent suggest that the
market is moving in that direction as far as ownership
goes.
United States
Financial flows from the United States into electricity
assets overseas leveled between 1999 and 2001 (Figure
78). Among developed countries, a large share of the
flow of U.S. overseas investment during the mid-1990s
was to the United Kingdom, shortly after the countrys
12 distribution companies were privatized and its electricity market was opened to foreign investment (Table
24). The first U.S. acquisition in the UK electricity sector
was in 1995, when Southern Company and PP&L
Resources purchased the distribution company SWEB
(formerly South Western Electricity). Of the 12 UK distribution companies, 8 were purchased by U.S.-based

Note: The utility investments shown include, in addition to

24 For foreign investment this chapter looks at the absolute stock of investment in overseas utilities. This stock represents the net effect of
both outflows and inflows. The foreign direct investment (FDI) position is the cumulative net flow of funds between a foreign-affiliated
company and its foreign owners. The U.S. Department of Commerce, the agency that collects data on FDI, measures FDI as the book value of
foreign direct investors equity in, and net outstanding loans to, their U.S. affiliates. The Commerce Department defines a U.S. affiliate as a
U.S. business enterprise in which one foreign direct investor owns 10 percent or more of the voting securities or the equivalent.

market. U.S. utilities have sold 5 of their UK distribution
companies since 1998.

25 Most of the investment shown was in electric utilities; however, the data source did not separate electric utilities from other utilities,
such as natural gas and sanitary.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
investment position in South American utilities may
also have peaked, although the data have yet to indicate
In many cases, U.S. companies paid a premium for their
overseas utility acquisitions and may not have been able
to realize expected returns. In the United Kingdom, for
example, unexpected regulatory interventions led to a
considerable drop in earnings for U.S. companies
invested in UK electricity distribution companies [3]. In
South America, economic recession and currency fluctuations made repayment of interest and principal on
loans used to acquire electricity assets exceedingly difficult. Further, some South American countries have been
reluctant to allow utilities to raise prices in order to
recoup increased fuel costs and capital and interest costs
[4]. A new political horizon appears to be emerging in
much of South America with the election of several
new governments in recent years. As a result, in the
near term, little if any new foreign investment capital
is expected to flow into South American electricity
ventures.
Total investment in U.S. utilities by foreign companies
also increased dramatically during the late 1990s (Figure
80). Although trailing the wave of U.S. investment in
electricity overseas by about 2 years, foreign companies
had invested roughly as much in U.S. utilities by 2000 as
U.S.-based companies had invested overseas. By far the

largest share of foreign investment in U.S. utilities has
come from the United Kingdom. The largest foreign-owned acquisition of a U.S. utility thus far has been
Scottish Powers purchase of PacifiCorp of Oregon for
$12.9 billion. Other important transactions include the
purchase of LG&E by the United Kingdoms PowerGen
for $5.4 billion in 2000; the purchase of New England
Electric System by UKs National Grid Companys for
$3.2 billion in 2000; and British Energys joint venture
with U.S.-based Exelon to form AmerGen.
In the mid- to late 1990s, there was also a wave of domestic mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. electricity sector
(Figure 81). By 2000 the trend had started to slow. Only
five announcements were made in 2001, and by mid-year 2002 only one announcement had been made.
Measured by announcement, domestic mergers and
acquisitions among U.S. electricity companies reached a
peak of 26 in 1999.
Several factors drove the U.S. electricity industry
retrenchment: falling stock prices and the difficulties
that posed in capital formation [5, 6]; a slowdown in
domestic economic growth; the fallout the entire industry experienced as a result of the financial scandal surrounding Enron and other energy companies; and the
recent spate of overbuilds during the late 1990s and
early 2000s. The collapse of the U.S. electricity merger
and acquisition market can be traced in part to the poor
financial performance of the industry since 1999. Overexpansion in the late 1990s and early 2000s may have
been one cause for the lack of activity as the U.S.

economy fell into recession just as a number of new
capacity builds came on line. Between 2000 and 2002,
133,457 megawatts of capacity were added to the U.S.
electrical grid, four times the amount of capacity
brought on during the previous 5 years [7]. In the process of this expansion, electricity companies amassed
unusually high debt loads, making further expansion in
the face of weakened economic growth doubtful.
Between 1998 and 2001, the fixed-income debt of electric
utilities more than doubled [8].
Hurt worst by falling stock prices were those companies
that diversified most from their core utility businesses.
Some companies have exited the nascent business of
electricity trading, and others have sold off assets
acquired domestically and overseas [9]. Several companies have seen their share prices plummet and their debt
downgraded to junk status [10]. According to a Standard and Poor report, during the first 9 months of 2002,
135 debt downgrades of electric utility holding companies took place, roughly four times the number during
the same period a year earlier [11]. The report also noted
that 11 percent of the companies surveyed were rated
below investment grade.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, much of the construction or acquisition of electricity generation assets was
financed by short-term debt, which has exposed several
companies to severe financial difficulties in 2003. It has
been estimated that utilities would need to refinance $50
billion in debt in early 2003. Utility financial health may
continue to deteriorate over the next several years if the
gap between available margins and utilized margins
widens. Fears of future overcapacity have led to the

cancellation of several power plants planned for
completion during 2003 and 2004 [12]. The Energy Information Administration forecasts growth in reserve margins from 16 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2004 [13].
Developing Countries
Developing nations are projected to consume 5,648 billion more megawatthours of commercial electricity in
2025 than in 2001 (see Table 22). An important element in
that consumption growth will be investment spending
needed for the developing worlds electricity generation
capacity to keep pace with future demand. Many developing nations have ambitious goals to expand their electricity infrastructure over the coming decades. Some
plans may prove feasible and others not. A major concern over whether developing countries can meet their
goals is how readily capital will become available to
fund needed investments.
Foreign investment in electricity, both private and noncommercial, has played a growing role in many nations
electricity sectors over the past decade (Figure 82 and
Table 25). In developing countries, after peaking at $49
billion in 1997, private investment in electricity projects
dropped to $10 billion in 2001, roughly equal to the level
in 1992, when foreign investment in electricity in developing nations first took off.
By region, however, private capital investment differs in
several ways. In some countries, foreign investment has
been restricted to new capacity additions, or primarily to
new electric power generation. This has generally been
true of Asia. In other countries, foreign investment has
been free to acquiring existing assets, e.g., a state-owned

electricity distribution company, as has generally been
the case in South America. In general, most private
investment capital has been in generation, which
accounted for four-fifths of total electricity investment
in the years 1990-1999 [14].
Investment in electricity projects in the developing
world showed substantial growth through most of the
1990s, followed by a decline with the onset of the Asian
economic crisis in 1997. Economic growth in developing
Asia has rebounded, along with private investment in
electricity projects, but investment in private-sector electricity projects in Latin America has not yet recovered, in
part because of the regions weak economic performance in recent years.
Foreign capital comes from a variety of commercial and
noncommercial sectors. Depending on the nation, reliance on foreign capital to finance electricity projects
varies considerably. The sources of capital also vary
from nation to nation, and countries frequently rely on a
diversity of resources for major electricity infrastructure
investment. Lenders may include multinational global
institutions (such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank), publicly held entities, foreign government loans (such as from the U.S. Export/Import
Bank), quasi-national organizations (such as Japans
Overseas Development Fund), and commercial bank
loans. In addition, several developing nations have chosen to acquire listings on foreign stock exchanges [15].
Western Europe
In Western Europe, electricity has traditionally been
supplied by state-owned national monopolies. Since the
implementation of the European Electricity Directive,
which became law in 1997,26 there has been a sharp
acceleration of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in
Western European electricity markets [16]. Unlike the
mergers and acquisitions in the UK electricity sector,
which were largely made by U.S. utilities, those in Western Europe have typically involved other European
firms, with U.S. companies playing a minor role. In 2000
and 2001 there were 35 mergers and acquisitions in
Western Europe, compared with 15 in 1998 and 1999
(Figure 83).

26 The European Electricity Directive became effective in February 1997. It called for the 15 EU member nations to open at least 26 percent
of their national markets to competition by February 1999, expanding to 30 percent in 2000 and 35 percent by 2003. The Directive established
uniform rules for all aspects of electricity supply and called for the unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Among European nations, Germany has seen the most
activity, much of which has involved German companies purchasing other German companies. Between 1998
and 2002 there were 23 mergers in the German electricity
sector [17]. The largest of all European mergers involved
E.ON, Germanys second largest electric power producer, and Ruhrgas, Germanys largest natural gas
producer [18]. Western Europes electricity sector is
increasingly being dominated by a handful of multinationals, and growth in electricity trade has paralleled the
continents electricity industry consolidation. Between
1999 and 2000, electricity trade in Western Europe grew
by 13 percent, compared with an average annual
increase of 4 percent for the 1990-2000 period [19].
E.ON has clearly joined the ranks of multinational utilities, with subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. In purchasing the United Kingdoms PowerGen,
E.ON became the second largest provider of electricity
to the UK market and owner of Kentucky-based utility
LG&E. Some other European electric utilities have also
extended their activities across the globe. Electricit de
France, for instance, reported in its 2001 annual report a
customer base of 43 million in 22 countries [20]. The
United Kingdoms International Power, in addition to
its domestic operations, had in mid-2002 operations in
the United States, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey, Australia, China, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan,
Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates [21].
Only a handful of the 15 EU members have been targets
of foreign electricity investment, depending on their
openness to market liberalization and other reform.
Table 26 shows a number of indicators estimating the
relative openness of selected EU countries electricity
sectors, as reported in an analysis sponsored by the UK
Department of Trade and Industry and the government
of the Netherlands. The table addresses several concepts
of openness. First is openness in the competitive
arena, which was evaluated by two measures: (1)
upstream market and wholesale competition, involving
electricity generation, and (2) downstream market competition, involving the ability of customers to switch
suppliers and the number of new entries into the supply
market. In both the upstream and downstream measures of openness in the competitive segment of the
industry, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany rank much higher than France,
Italy, and Spain. Second is openness in noncompetitive
areas, involving such factors as the degree of fair and
open access to the transmission grid and regulatory
independence. In these areas, the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands rank relatively high, but Italy
ranks higher than Germany. As a result of their relative
openness, levels of concentration in the electricity markets of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany,

in comparison with those in other European countries
(Table 27).
World Electricity Deregulation
Since the early 1980s, several nations have experimented
with various models of electricity reform.27 Some have
worked reasonably well, others have not, and nations
considering reform have closely watched other nations
experiments. Over the past several years, some of the
developments that prevailed in global electricity markets in the 1990s appear to have stalled or, in some cases,
moved backward. In India, electricity sector reforms
have been introduced but then have had to be adjusted
when they have failed to produce the intended results
(see box on page 146). It still seems likely, however, that
nations, states, and regions will continue with electricity
sector reforms. Indeed, both South Korea and Mexico
are moving ahead aggressively (see box on page 150);
and U.S. States like Pennsylvania and Texas have
launched relatively successful restructuring programs
(see box on page 151). Disappointing results in some
markets are expected to be brought into better perspective in the future as more reform efforts prove successful
and past mistakes are avoided.
Three notable examples of reforms that have failed to
live up to expectations are the restructuring programs in
California, England and Wales (the UK model),28 and
Ontario. Although the California and UK experiences
involved a host of different reforms, from dealing with
stranded costs to implementing retail competition,
where both efforts failed notably was in the implementation of competitive electricity trading arrangements
particularly in California. In Ontario, reforms did not
fail to meet expectations so much as they were rejected
by the public due to summer heat-related price shocks
that came about when some prices were decontrolled.
To the extent that regulatory reform in electricity has
been successful, it has often been emulated elsewhere.
To the extent that nations have viewed their reform
efforts as failed, in some cases modifications have come
about; in others, reregulation has been introduced.
Although various degrees of reregulation have been
introduced elsewhere, including in New Zealand and
several Eastern European countries [22], probably
nowhere has the retreat from electricity reform been so
dramatic as in California.
California
In designing its electricity reform model, California borrowed several elements from the UK model, including a
requirement that all sales be made through a daily pool.
In the California Power Exchange (PX), the pool price
was determined in the following manner: the PX created
an electricity supply and demand curve by combining

27 Chile is generally regarded as the nation that led the current wave of wholesale electricity reform (which started in Chile during the
early 1980s).
28 Electricity reforms on England and Wales are widely referred to as UK reforms. Although the United Kingdom includes Northern Ireland and Scotland, which have embarked on separate reform efforts, what has become known as the UK model refers to developments in
England and Wales. The UK model involved separating the four sectors of electricity supply (generation, transmission, distribution, and
marketing) by ownership and by function and the implementation of a competitive electricity trading arrangement for the competitive elements of the electricity market. It also involved retail competition. For transmission and distribution, a performance-based price formula
was employed, indexed to the general rate of inflation and a productivity factor. This regulatory scheme became known as RPI-X.

Electricity Reform in India
Electricity reform activities in India have increased
markedly in the past decade. Reforms have been
spurred by the underlying need for access to affordable, reliable electricity. Indias Planning Commission
estimated in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997-2002) that
additional generation capacity 40,245 megawatts
would be needed to meet the governments goal of
8-percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP);
however, only 19,015 megawatts of additional capacity
was added.a The shortfall in capacity growth can be
attributed to economic and technical inefficiencies in
the power sector structure. A financially strong sector
is needed to increase generation capacity, renovate and
modernize current plants, and increase coverage and
access of power service.
The poor financial health of the power sector can be
attributed mainly to electricity tariffs that do not accurately reflect the cost of providing electricity service.
Average revenues from the power sector are lower
than the average cost of producing power. Although
tariffs for the commercial and industrial sectors are set
higher then their fully allocated costs, they are not high
enough to offset the subsidy inherent in residential and
agricultural rates. Tariffs have been influenced by
political considerations. For example, many of the agricultural subsidies stemmed from the Green Revolution
of the 1980s, when certain political parties used populist measures to win elections, such as offering lower
tariff rates to support farmers.b
Another factor affecting the financial solvency of the
sector is transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.
T&D losses are estimated at 30 to 50 percent, which are
considerably higher than those of other developing
nations, such as China (7 percent) and Indonesia (12
percent).c T&D losses consist of both technical losses
(15 to 20 percent), such as transmission line loss, and
nontechnical losses (20 to 25 percent), such as theft.
In addition, low billing and collection efficiency has
contributed to the mounting financial insolvency of
the state electricity utilities. These losses translate
into commercial losses of almost $3 billiond or financial
losses equal to nearly 1 percent of the national GDP.
This is a major drain on the Indian economy, amounting to twice what the government spends on health
and one-half of what it spends on education.e
According to the Indian constitution, the power sector
is treated as a multijurisdictional entity, where both the
central and state governments have jurisdiction. This
has resulted in a division of activities such as
policymaking, planning, financing, and operating
between the state and central governments. The Ministry of Power oversees power policy at the federal level
and receives guidance from the Planning Commission.
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) provides technical analysis and approval of power projects. Several
public sector corporations operate generation, transmission, and rural electrification and handle financial
issues surrounding those activities.
After gaining independence from the British in 1947,
the government of India enacted the Electricity Supply
Act of 1948. The 1948 Act brought all new power generation, transmission, and distribution under the responsibility of the public sector, especially at the state level.
As a result, each state and union territory established
State Electricity Boards (SEBs), vertically integrated
entities that were funded by the state governments. By
the early 1990s, the SEBs controlled 70 percentf of the
generation, most of the transmission lines, and a majority of the distribution.
After sustaining a closed economy since independence, India experienced a balance of payments crisis in
the early 1990s. As part of an effort to liberalize the
economy, an amendment was made to the 1948 Electricity Supply Act, called the Electricity Laws (Amendment) Act of 1991. One purpose of the legislation was
to encourage private investment in power generation
through eight fast track projects. Independent power
producers were invited to build power plants with
incentives from the central government, including
speedier technical, economic, and environmental clearances by the CEA, as well as counter-guaranteesg by

the government of India, a guaranteed 16-percent
return on equity, and tax holidays.
The Mega-Power Policy was later introduced, with
special incentives for construction and operation of
thermal plants over 1,000 megawatts and hydro plants
over 500 megawatts. By the end of 1993, more than 140
applications had been received for 70,000 megawatts of
capacity, but by 1995-96, despite enthusiastic response
to the private power policy, no projects had been initiated on the ground. Of the eight fast-track projects to
which the best possible terms had been offered, none
was near financial closure.h The most controversial and
highly-publicized of the fast track projects, U.S.
Enrons Dabhol power project, exemplified the many
issues that were hindering growth of power generation: financial insolvency of the SEBs, political interference, lack of transparent regulatory structure, and
other inefficiencies in the system.
Because of the failure of the fast track projects and the
slow progress of state-level reforms, the central government acknowledged the need for more comprehensive reforms at the national level. In 1998, the central
government passed the Electricity Regulatory Commission Ordinance (ERC) establishing the Central
Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and encouraging the establishment of State Electricity
Regulatory Commissions (SERCs). CERC would be
responsible for regulating tariffs of centrally owned
utilities, regulating interstate transmission, providing
guidelines for tariff setting to SERCs, and handling disputes between generation and transmission entities.
The SERCs would be able to set tariffs, procure and
purchase power, and promote competition and more
efficient operations.
In 2000, the Electricity Bill was introduced to the Indian
parliament as a piece of comprehensive legislation to
replace all other electricity legislation. The bill has seen
several incarnations while awaiting passage. The Electricity Bill consists of the such measures as generation
free from licensing (except for hydro units), mandatory
establishment of state-level regulatory commissions,
open access for transmission and distribution, and
retail tariff setting by the regulatory commissions. The
Ministry of Power developed a Blueprint for Power
Sector Development in the spring of 2001, in which
power sector reform was outlined.
hTata
As discussed in the Blueprint, distribution reform is a
crucial component of the reform process, which has
been addressed in recent reform legislation and activity. The central government is financially supporting
distribution reform through the Accelerated Power
Development Reforms Programme (APDRP). Thirtyfive billion rupees ($700 million) was appropriated
in the 2002-2003 Union Budget for the APDRP to support 63 distribution circles. Distribution circles are an
attempt to disaggregate state monitoring operations to
small, manageable profit centers, which would be
responsible and accountable for their losses. The distribution circles will implement full metering, energy
audits, management information systems, control of
theft, increased transformation capacity, increases in
the ratio of high-voltage to low-voltage transmission (it
is more difficult to steal electricity from a high-voltage
line), and reduction of technical losses.
Reforms at the state and union territory level began
long before the central government provided an
umbrella framework for power sector reform. Several
statesHaryana, Orissa, and Andhra Pradeshwere
encouraged by the World Bank to undertake structural
reforms in their power sectors to maintain funding for
power projects through Adaptable Program Loans.i
Most states have established electricity regulatory
commissions in an effort to move toward cost-based
prices. Some states and union territories have unbundled their SEBs into separate units for generation,
transmission, and distribution.
The process of corporatization and privatization has
been much slower than other reform activities, as seen
in the state of Orissa electricity reform experiment.
Orissa has been at the forefront of Indias stateinitiated reform efforts with the World Bank playing a
role in promoting, financing, and guiding the reforms.
The World Bank canceled financial assistance of $156
million to Orissa for the Upper Indravati Hydroelectric
Project in 1991 because of slow progress and lack of satisfaction with contracts awardedj and announced that
it would reissue the assistance only if Orissa would
reform its electricity sector.k In 1993, the World Bank
converted some of the funds from the canceled hydro
project to provide assistance to the state governments
electricity reform program.

Electricity Reform in India (Continued)
In 1995, the Orissa Electricity Reform Act was enacted
to support several actions. The first was the establishment of an Electricity Regulatory Commission, which
was entrusted with tariff setting as well as acting as an
independent regulatory body. The Orissa State Electricity Board was unbundled into state-owned companies: GRIDCO to handle transmission and distribution,
Orissa Power Generation Corporation, and Orissa
Hydro Power Corporation. It also allowed for private
investment in generation. In 1997, privatization of the
distribution sector commenced through the establishment of distribution companies. The state was divided
into four geographic distribution zones, which were
bid out to various private entities. Bombay Suburban
Electric Supply (BSES) bought three of the zones and
the U.S. firm AES bought the fourth.
Each of these actions was implemented in Orissa with
mixed levels of success. One of the conditions set by the
World Bank was to reduce the levels of T&D loss. However, due to a lack of accurate information on T&D
losses, the distribution companies were given underestimated T&D loss values. Their loss reduction targets
were based on the initial estimates, but once metering
and other technologies were installed, the real loss values were ascertained to be much higher (see table).

Furthermore, several financial matters proved troubling. Because the SEB was already in poor financial
shape, it was difficult to attract potential buyers in the
bidding process and spur competition. Competition
was also curbed by the reintroduction of horizontal
and vertical integration. BSES, an electricity supplier,
controlled three of the four distribution zones and AES,
operating the fourth, was also heavily involved with
generation in Orissa. As a result, private investors
found it difficult to estimate the risks involved in participating in the newly reformed electricity sector. One
of the risks was estimating revenues from the retail tariff, because the pricing system was based on an annual
tariff hearing. The process of divestiture of assets to the
private sector was also contentious: undervaluing the
assets was perceived to be giving them away to the
private firm; overvaluing the assets would increase the
pricing of tariffs and thus increase retail prices.l
Delhi, a union territory, has also recently embarked on
power sector reform. There is confidence in the Delhi
model, which builds on the experience in Orissa and
must only contend with an urban setting versus the
much more dispersed rural setting. After the ERC Act
in 1998, Delhi instituted the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC). The Delhi Vidyut Board
(former electricity board) was unbundled and privatized in 1999. Based on lessons learned in Orissa, the
privatization of the Delhi electricity board dealt with
the issue of asset valuation, developed a new method
for estimating financial risk from T&D loss, and also
changed the system of bidding for distribution companies.m
The regulatory commission in Delhi is using a business
valuation of the assets (based on the future earning
potential) to avoid overvaluation. DERC has also been
responsible for estimating the level of aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C)n and then setting
the loss level for the bidding process.o Selection of bidders for the three distribution companies is based on
the maximum reduction of AT&C loss over a 5-year
period. (In contrast, in Orissa, the highest bidder for a
51-percent equity stake in the company was awarded
the contract.)p Furthermore, in Delhi the distribution
companies will be able to realize a 16-percent rate of
return on equity only if the minimum loss reductions
are met.q Subsidies will not be removed immediately
as they were in Orissa. Instead, the territorial government has acknowledged the need for transition period
measures.

Electricity Reform in India (Continued)
As Indias experiment in power sector reform unfolds,
it remains to be seen whether Delhi will be able to
internalize the issues highlighted in the Orissa privatization process. If Delhi can construct a profitable
model, other states (all in different stages of the reform
process) may also adopt similar methodologies and
work toward a more financially viable power sector.
all generator supply bids with all consumer demand
bids. The clearing price (the price paid to generators by
suppliers) was determined by the intersection of the
supply and demand curves. This was similar to the pricing scheme initially employed in the United Kingdom,
except that in the United Kingdom demand was estimated by the National Grid Company. What distinguished the California Pool was the separation of the
California Independent System Operator (CAISO) from
the PX. Moreover, California reforms did not provide
pool participants with the hedging opportunities that
the contracts for differences market provided in the
United Kingdom. UK electricity suppliers made extensive use of such contracts, which greatly reduced their
exposure to price fluctuations. The contracts for differences market allowed UK generators to hedge between
80 and 90 percent of their exposure in the day-ahead
market [23].
Several structural flaws have been identified in Californias restructured market following the States electricity crisis. One was the requirement that California
utilities purchase all their power through the PX;
another was the prevention of purchasing power in a
forward market that forced California utilities to buy
short for their longterm electricity supply contracts;
another was the degree to which the California market
encouraged competition. Energy companies and energy
traders have admitted to trying to manipulate the
California energy market during the electricity crisis,
and others have been accused of doing so by the Federal Government [24]. One method of manipulation
involved the fee that companies could earn by reducing
load on voltage lines that were overburdened. Companies have been accused of wrongfully creating congestion on paper where no congestion actually occurred.
In order to do this, companies simply needed to schedule electricity to be sent over lines where the nominated
values would cause congestion, even though they had
no intention of actually using the lines. This act alone
could result in the company being compensated for providing no service at all.
In May 2002, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released Enron internal corporate
memos that suggested that Enron was scheming the
California energy market by creating phantom congestion and then being compensated for alleviating that

further that Enron overcharged customers in California
for natural gas. And in August 2002, the FERC commenced an investigation to see whether three companies
sought to control supply in the California market and
thus create a runup in prices and profits. In November
2002, Williams Companies agreed to pay $400 million to
settle accusations that it had gamed the West Coast electricity market and to restructure a $4.3 billion long-term
electricity contract with California, whereby the State
plans to save $1 billion [25].
In July 2002, several companies had reached a settlement
with the State government to reimburse the State for a
portion of the profits they earned during the energy crisis. The California State government was seeking $21 billion of the $43 billion in long-term contracts the State
signed in 2001, claiming that the contracts were signed
when the companies exercised illegal control over the
California electricity market [26]. In March 2003, FERC
staff recommended that the Commission issue show
cause orders to companies that alledgedly violated Californias trading rules. Under the show cause orders,
companies would be held liable for the repayment of
unfair profits unless they prove that their actions were
justified [27].
The UK Model
In contrast to Californias experience with electricity
reform, the UK experience was largely successful, with
the exception of introducing a satisfactory level of competition in the national pool. In early 2001, the United
Kingdom shut down the pool, which had been in operation since 1990, and embarked on a new form of electricity trading system, called the New Electricity Trading
Arrangement (NETA). This was done because it was felt
that the old pool arrangements did not foster adequate
competition. The initial pool setup was supposed to
be the major arena in which competition was to be
introduced in the UK electricity market [28]. However,
even after the UK generation market was broken up
during the mid-1990s, the UK pool was still highly
concentrated.
The effort to instill more competition in the UK electricity pool involved policy changes that amounted to fine
tuning. The power pool was altered so that the clearing
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
price became the bid price rather than the system marginal price as in the past. Further, generators were no
longer forced to bid into the pool and were free to negotiate bilateral contracts.
The most commonly perceived failure of the old UK
electricity pool was that bidding prices within the pool
could easily be manipulated due to the small number of
participants and to pool rules that were susceptible to
manipulation through strategic bidding. Both auction
theory and game theory come into play in trying to create a pool immune to such collusive behavior. In any
event, since the initiation of the UK electricity pool in
1990, most of the efficiency gains realized through cost
reductions at generation companies were not passed
through to consumers. Despite generation costs falling
by half, pool prices changed little after the inception of
the electricity pool [29].
One feature of the UK pool that may have led to strategic
bidding was the system marginal price. The way in
which the UK electricity auction occurred was that generators bid into the system up to the point at which the
bids provided enough capacity to clear demand as forecasted by the National Grid Company. The price bid on
the last unit of capacity to clear the system became the
system marginal price. This provided an incentive to
manipulate the system by bidding in higher cost units in
order to drive up the price, which is exactly what the
major operators in the UK pool have frequently been
accused of doing.
The major difference between NETA and the original
pool is that the system marginal price, which was provided to all bidders who cleared the pool under the old
system, was replaced by a pay-as-bid price. This was
done so as to make market manipulation through strategic bidding less likely. Another significant difference is
that NETA allows bilateral forward contracts. About
98 percent of electricity is now traded bilaterally
[30]. NETA also allowed derivative trading, which provided another means of hedging exposure to price
fluctuations.
NETA differs in several other important instances from
the old UK electricity pool. NETA allows for selfdispatch instead of the National Grid Company performing the role of scheduler and orderer in addition to
its role as a transmission provider, which made it the
equivalent of the PX and CAISO combined. Under the
old system, the responsibility of ensuring adequate electricity supply was entirely in the hands of the National
Grid Company, which was responsible for forecasting
electricity demand on a half-hourly basis for the following day. Under NETA, this responsibility was transferred to the generators themselves. Further, NETA
opened up the wholesale market to non-generators, thus
allowing commodity traders to participate in the market
[31]. Unlike the old pool, NETA does not include a
capacity mechanism.
Since NETA was implemented, electricity prices have
fallen dramatically in the United Kingdom. However, a
South Korea and Mexico Press Ahead with Reforms
South Korea is one nation still moving ahead aggressively with electricity reform. A central element of the
reforms is a dismantling of the state-owned utility,
Kepco, along its functional units: generation, transmission, and distribution. The first phase of restructuring
was scheduled for 2000, when Kepco was split into six
individual companies: one nuclear and hydro company and five thermal power companies. The second
phase of restructuring, which took place in 2000-2002,
involved the creation of a market, a system operator,
and an electricity pool. During the third phase,
2003-2009, regional distribution companies are scheduled for privatization.a
Mexico has also proceeded with electricity reform
efforts. Mexican electricity reforms got started in 1992
with the passage of the Public Electricity Service Act,
which allowed a limited opening of the electricity supply industry to non-government-owned entities. Private parties were allowed to participate in electricity
generation, although they had to sell their power to the
federal electricity commission. As a result of the Act, an
independent electricity sector has emerged in Mexico,
along with some foreign investment. The Mexican government has estimated that the nation will need $5 billion in electricity investment over the next 10 years.
The president of Mexico hopes that private investors
will add 30,000 megawatts of capacity over the next
10 years, which would nearly double Mexicos
current capacity. The Act retained the monopoly of
the Comisin Federal de Electricidad (CFE) as sole purchaser of electric power. After more than 2 years
of debate, the Mexican Senate in November 2002
forwarded a legislation bill that would alter the Mexican constitution to allow private investment in electricity. The bill would also create separate generation,
transmission, and distribution companies, create an
independent system operator, and allow for the development of a merchant power industry.b

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Successful Electricity Restructuring in Texas and Pennsylvania
Over the past decade, U.S. States have been exploring
options for opening electricity markets to competition.
Although Californias restructuring failures are well
documented, a number of States have had more successful electricity restructuring programs, and efforts
to restructure electricity markets are continuing.
Twenty-four States and the District of Columbia have
enacted legislation that allows various levels of retail
competition, and 18 States and the District of Columbia
are actively implementing restructured retail markets.
All are currently considered to be in the transition to
competition. Pennsylvania and Texas provide two
examples of what are generally regarded as successful
restructuring programs, although both systems continue to be fine-tuned as issues arise.
Successful competition has been measured by such
factors as the amount of load supplied by competitive
suppliers, the level of sustained price decreases, and
the ability to weather price spikes and/or support conditions that discourage frequent price spikes. Within
the wholesale market, the ability to manage congestion, provide for competitive prices, and limit the ability of participants to exercise market control are
considered important to maintaining a successful open
market structure.
Pennsylvanias wholesale electricity market is controlled by the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), which operates in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Washington, DC, and
parts of Virginia and is widely recognized as the most
successful U.S. RTO to date. PJM provides settlement
of day-ahead and hourly prices, as well as energy
scheduling and balancing for the Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware and Maryland region, and agreements are in the works to coordinate and perhaps
merge with other RTOs and power areas. PJMs system
of locational marginal pricing is emerging as an effective way to manage congestion of the transmission grid
through competitive prices.
Pennsylvanias reform efforts implemented several
unique policy measures. For instance, the State initiated a shopping credita credit on the generation portion of a customers bill to be used to pay a competitive
provider. The customer would keep savings realized
by choosing the competitive provider. This, coupled
with a very humorous consumer education program,
was credited for several years of success in inducing
customer switching (almost one-quarter of the total
State load at one point).
Pennsylvania has also led the development of a
Mid-Atlantic model for uniform business practices.a
Dramatic increases in natural gas prices in 2002, which
led to substantial increases in U.S. electricity prices,
diminished the competitiveness of some electricity
suppliers. Many left the market, initiating a customer
return to providers of last resortsuppliers designated for customers dropped by their competitive suppliers. After 2001, however, this service was provided
not by incumbent utilities but by the suppliers that
offered the best rates. For example, most customers of
southwestern Pennsylvanias Duquesne Light finished
paying stranded costs in March 2002, and now 27 percent of the electricity load in the territory is supplied
competitively.b Even with the increase in natural gas
prices, Pennsylvanias electricity prices have been
reduced by about 8 percent (in real dollars) since
restructuring legislation was enacted in 1996.
In Texas, full retail competition began on January 1,
2002, for customers in the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas (ERCOT) RTO. Today, about 25 percent of
demand in the ERCOT area is served by competitive
suppliers.c In September 2001, utilities in Texas began
the process of auctioning off part of their generating
capacity. Restructuring legislation requires each generation company affiliated with a former monopoly utility to sell entitlements to at least 15 percent of its
installed generation capacity at least 60 days before full
retail competition begins.d Customers that require over
1.0 megawatts of generating capacity are not provided
default service. In other words, they must choose a
competitive service. Default and provider-of-lastresort services are provided at market rates.
The market in Texas differs from restructured markets
in other States in that utilities are required to establish
separate affiliates to provide retail service to customers, forcing distribution companies to stay out of retail
marketing and generation. This has achieved a level of
functional separation similar to the forced divestiture
required by States such as Massachusetts. The Texas
Public Utility Commission is working with ERCOT to
explore transmission congestion and pricing reform, as
well as demand response programs.

concern arising from NETAs initial success is that by
driving electricity prices substantially lower, NETA will
not remunerate electricity companies for investing in
future power stations, thus guaranteeing future supply
shortages and higher prices. The industry has called for
a capacity mechanism to be put in place to ensure
against future electricity shortages. Since March 2002,
several generation companies have shut down capacity
as a result of the low pool prices and have voiced concerns that NETA was at fault [32].
When electricity reform was being considered in
Ontario, another justification was that several other
nations and regions had already done it, and reforms
were necessary to keep Ontario economically competitive. In several respects the reforms undertaken in
Ontario resembled those in the United Kingdom, California, and elsewhere [35]. In 1997, the Ontario government developed a nine-point plan for dealing with
several shortcomings in the provinces electricity industry [36]. The plan was intended to:
Devising trading arrangements suitable to a commodity
with such unusual features as electricity has been an
area that has dogged reformers in several countries,
states, and provinces. Sharp price spikes are not new to
pool-based electricity exchange systems. One concern
that arose over Californias recent experience with its
electricity pool is whether suppliers under certain pool
designs can achieve excessive market power. In countries that have adopted pool-based electricity trading
systems, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, similar concerns have arisen over the connection
between price spikes and market power.
Create a competitive market in the year 2000 for both
wholesale and retail customers
Separate monopoly operations from competitive
businesses throughout the electricity sectors
Provide the Ontario Energy Board with an expanded
mandate to protect electricity consumers
Take steps to ensure environmental protection
Encourage cost savings in the local distribution
sector
Ontario
Canada is another country that has backtracked somewhat in its electricity reform efforts. Since the early
1990s, some Canadian provinces have undertaken
efforts at electricity reform. Most have involved modest
changes, such as providing large users with the freedom
to choose their electricity suppliers. Thus far, only
Alberta and Ontario have embarked on wide-scale
reforms.
Alberta was first in implementing electricity reform, a
central feature of which was the initiation of an electricity pool. More recently, Ontario has introduced electricity reform efforts that include the creation of an
electricity pool, dismantling of the former state-owned
utility, future privatization, and consumer choice. One
motivation behind Ontarios electricity reform was the
unsatisfactory performance of the nuclear power plants
operated by the previous public utility, Ontario Hydro
[33].
When Ontario began restructuring its electricity industry, the province faced a number of issues, many of
which had motivated electricity reform efforts elsewhere. In particular, Ontarios electricity provider at the
time, Ontario Hydro [34], was viewed as inefficiently
run, as having charged excessively high prices, and as
having accumulated financially imprudent levels of
debt. One indicator of the electricity sectors inefficiency
was that Ontario Hydros nuclear capacity factor averaged 80 percent in 1980-1983, fell to 70 percent in
1984-1989, and then fell to 65 percent in 1990-1996.
Establish an Independent Market Operator and provide for an interim supply market for replacement
power
Establish a level playing field on taxes and regulation
Restructure Ontario Hydro into new companies with
clear business mandates
Take action to put the new electricity companies on a
sound economic and financial footing.
The Energy Competition Act, which went into effect in
1998, did away with Ontario Hydros monopoly in electricity supply [37]. Ontario Hydro was split into two successor companies: Ontario Power Generation, which
assumed ownership of the generation assets of Ontario
Hydro, and Hydro One, which assumed ownership of
the transmission assets. The two companies began operating separately in April 1999. Three other entities were
also created: an Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO) similar to the CAISO in California; an Electrical Safety Authority (ESA); and an Ontario Electricity
Financial Corporation (OEFC), which took on the
multibillion-dollar debt of the former Ontario Hydro.
The purpose of the nonprofit IMO was to manage the
pool and transmission system; the purpose of the ESA
was to conduct electrical safety inspections; and the purpose of OEFC was to service and retire the former
Ontario Hydros provincially guaranteed debt and manage certain other legacy liabilities, most related to investments in nuclear power. Ontario Hydros debt had
increased from $12 billion in 1980 to $38 billion in 1999.
As in the United Kingdom and California, the issue of
how to address the financing of stranded costs (mostly
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
related to nuclear power) was a major concern in
Ontarios electricity reform. In Ontario, a portion of the
costs are to be recovered through transition surcharges29
[38, 39].
Rather than privatizing Ontario Power Generation outright, the Ontario government chose to introduce market principles by requiring that the new company
decontrol generation assets. This was achieved to a
small degree when Ontario Power Generation leased its
Bruce nuclear power units to Bruce Power Partnership,
which was 95 percent owned by British Energy. Ontario
Power Generation was also ordered to shed 4,000 megawatts of assets over 3 years and to reduce its share of the
provinces electricity market to 35 percent by 2012.
Although the provincial government had intended to
privatize Hydro One as a part of the overall reform
scheme, in January 2003 the provincial premier
announced that it would retain full ownership of the
entity [40]. It had intended that the proceeds from the
sale of Hydro One were to be used to retire a portion of
the debt (stranded costs) of the former Ontario Hydro.
In contrast to generation, Hydro One, the provinces
transmission operations, has continued to be regulated,
although Ontarios intent was to eventually adopt a performance-based regulation, similar to the form of regulation employed in the United Kingdom. The Ontario
Energy Board Act (a companion piece of legislation to
the Energy Competition Act) instituted the Ontario
Energy Board (OEB), which is an independent
quasi-judicial entity. The OEB licenses all market participants in the electricity sector and oversees transmission
and distribution rates. The board is also charged with
assuring that nondiscriminatory open access is implemented in transmission.
Ontario also intended to introduce retail competition.
The Competition Act envisioned full retail competition
being implemented in 2000 for all classes of customersindustrial, commercial, and residential.30 Power
marketers were allowed to begin contacting potential
customers in March 2000 and to enter into contracts the
following November.
In May 2002, Ontario began operation of the electricity
pool. The pool was similar to the California pool in that
both electricity suppliers and consumers were to bid
into the market, with no forward market as an alternative. The pools pricing mechanism was set up much like
the UK pool. The price offered by the last unit to clear the
market (the system marginal price) became the market
price that was paid to all generators.
Ontario did not, however, allow for completely competitive market-based prices. Rather, electricity consumers
were allowed either to choose to purchase power at a
fixed price or to choose one based on the wholesale pool
price. During the summer of 2002, exceptionally hot
weather sent electricity prices soaring in the pool as they
attained their market-clearing levels. Although the price
spikes did not come close to those experienced in the
California, monthly bills showed a 20-percent increase
above government forecasts [41]. As a result of public
concern, in November 2002, Ontarios government
ordered a 4.3 cents (Canadian) per kilowatthour cap on
wholesale prices and rebates to consumers for previous
price increases.

Environmental Issues and World Energy Use
In the coming decades, responses to environmental issues could affect patterns
of energy use around the world. Actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions could alter
the level and composition of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by energy source.
Two major environmental issues, global climate change
and local or regional air pollution, could affect energy
use throughout the world in the coming decades. Future
actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions and global
efforts to reduce the potential impacts of climate change,
as well as localized policies and regulations designed to
limit energy-related emissions of airborne pollutants
other than carbon dioxide, are likely to affect the level,
composition, and growth of global energy use.
In recent years there has been ongoing study and debate
about the possible contribution of energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to
global climate change, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a statistically
significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended
period (typically decades or longer) . . . [which] may be
due to natural internal processes or external forcing, or
to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition
of the atmosphere or in land use [1]. Carbon dioxide,
one of the most prevalent greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, has two major anthropogenic (human-caused)
sources: combustion of fossil fuels and changes in land
use. Net releases of carbon dioxide from these two
sources are believed to be contributing to the rapid rise
in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide since
pre-industrial times. Because estimates indicate that
approximately 80 percent of all anthropogenic carbon
dioxide emissions come from fossil fuel combustion,
world energy use has emerged at the center of the climate change debate [2].
At the same time, concern about the local environmental
and air quality impacts of mobile and stationary energy
consumption have resulted in increasingly stringent
regulation of air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides,31 particulate matter, and volatile organic
compounds. Some countries are also considering ways
to limit emissions of mercury from electric power generation to avoid the possible contamination of land surfaces, rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Global Outlook for Carbon Dioxide
Emissions
The International Energy Outlook 2003 (IEO2003) projects
emissions of energy-related carbon dioxide, which, as
noted above, account for the majority of global
anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Based on
expectations of regional economic growth and dependence on fossil energy in the IEO2003 reference case,
global carbon dioxide emissions are expected to grow
more rapidly over the projection period than they did
during the 1990s. A projected increase in fossil fuel consumption, particularly in developing countries, is
largely responsible for the expectation of fast-paced
growth in carbon dioxide emissions. Factors such as
population growth, rising personal incomes, rising standards of living, and further industrialization are
expected to have a much greater influence on levels of
energy consumption in developing countries than in
industrialized nations. Energy-related emissions are
projected to grow most rapidly in China, the country
expected to have the highest rate of growth in per capita
income and fossil fuel use over the forecast period.
Carbon intensitythe amount of carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of gross domestic product (GDP)is projected to improve (decrease) throughout the world over
the next two decades (Table 28). In particular, steep rates
of improvement are expected among the transitional
economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union (EE/FSU). In the FSU, economic recovery from
the upheaval of the 1990s is expected to continue
throughout the forecast. The FSU nations are also
expected to replace old and inefficient capital stock and
increasingly use less carbon-intensive natural gas for
electricity generation and other end uses in place of
more carbon-intensive oil and coal. Eastern European
nations have been in economic recovery longer than has
the FSU, and natural gas is expected to continue to displace coal use in the region, resulting in an average
2.8-percent annual improvement (decrease) in carbon
intensity for Eastern Europe as a whole.
31 Nitrogen oxides (NO ) is the term used to describe the sum of nitric oxide (NO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO ), and other oxides of nitrogen
that are short-lived atmospheric gases that are produced by the burning of fossil fuels and play a major role in the formation of ozone
(smog). Nitrous oxide (N2O), discussed later in this chapter, is a long-lived atmospheric gas produced primarily as a result of nitrogen fertilization of soils, mobile source combustion, and the decomposition of solid waste from domesticated animals. Nitrous oxide is a powerful
greenhouse gas.

Fairly rapid improvement in carbon intensity is also projected for the large developing countries China and
India, primarily as a result of rapid economic growth
rather than a switch to less carbon-intensive fuels. Both
China and India are projected to remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, particularly coal, in the IEO2003 reference case, but their combined annual GDP growth is
projected to average 5.9 percent, compared with an
expected 3.4-percent annual rate of increase in fossil fuel
use from 2001 to 2025.
In 2001, carbon dioxide emissions from industrialized
countries were 49 percent of the global total, followed by
developing countries at 38 percent and the EE/FSU at 13
percent. By 2025, developing countries are projected to
account for the largest share of world carbon dioxide
emissions, at 46 percent, followed by the industrialized
world at 42 percent and the EE/FSU at 12 percent. The
IEO2003 projections indicate that carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries could surpass those
from industrialized countries by 2020 (Figure 84).
In the industrialized world, almost one-half of energyrelated carbon dioxide emissions in 2001 came from oil
use, followed by coal at 31 percent (Figure 85). Over the
forecast period, oil is projected to remain the primary
source of carbon dioxide emissions in industrialized
countries because of its continued importance in the
transportation sector, where there are currently few economical alternatives. Natural gas use and associated
emissions are projected to increase substantially, particularly for electricity generation. By 2025, the share of
natural-gas-related emissions, at 26 percent, is expected
to be almost equal to that of coal.

The United States is currently the largest energy consumer in the industrialized world, accounting for the
majority of its energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.
Natural gas and coal use for electricity generation in the
United States are projected to increase over the forecast
period, whereas generation from nuclear energy is expected to decline after 2010. Absent mandatory carbon
reduction policies, no new nuclear plants are expected to
be constructed in the United States by 2025, given the
more favorable economics of competing technologies.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
As a result, U.S. electricity generation is projected to
become more carbon intensive over the forecast period.
With the exception of Australia, most other industrialized countries rely much less heavily on coal to meet
domestic energy needs than does the United States. In
Western Europe, coal consumption is projected to continue to decline over the forecast period as natural gas
consumption, particularly for electricity generation,
increases. The projected decline in Western Europes
carbon intensity, brought on by the continued shift in
the overall energy supply toward more natural gas, is
lessened somewhat by the projected decline in nuclear
power generation after 2010. Germany and Sweden
have committed to shutting down their nuclear power
industries, and other European countries are considering similar proposals. Electricity generation from other
non-emitting energy sources, such as hydroelectricity
and wind power, is not expected to increase sufficiently
to offset the drop in nuclear energy production in the
region.
In the transitional economies of the EE/FSU region, 40
percent of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions
come from natural gas combustion. Coal production and
consumption in the EE/FSU declined as a result of economic reforms and industry restructuring during the
1990s, bringing about an increase in the natural gas
share of the energy and emissions mix during the
period. With further development of the vast natural gas
reserves in Russia and the Caspian Sea region, natural
gas is expected to continue to displace coal. Oil consumption is also projected to increase in the FSU, particularly for transportation and power generation, as

With further restructuring of the coal mining industries
in Poland and the Czech Republic, declines in coal production and consumption are expected to continue.
Natural gas consumption is expected to increase significantly in Eastern European countries, in part because of
the strict environmental standards required for membership in the European Union (EU). As a result of the
projected changes in the energy mix, carbon intensity is
expected to decline in Eastern Europe more than in any
other region over the forecast period. Nevertheless,
because the decline in carbon intensity is not expected to
keep pace with growth in total energy consumption,
annual carbon dioxide emissions in the region are
expected to increase by nearly 35 percent between 2001
and 2025.
Compared with most of the industrialized countries, a
much larger share of energy consumption in developing
countries (particularly in Africa and Asia) comes from
biomass, which includes wood, charcoal, animal waste,
and agricultural residues. Because data on biomass use
in developing nations are often sparse or inadequate,
IEO2003 does not include the combustion of biomass
fuels in its coverage of current or projected energy consumption. For the United States, combustion of biomass
is counted in energy consumption; however, because
carbon dioxide emissions from biomass are considered
to be part of the natural carbon cycle, they are not
included in projections of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
emissions.
Of the fossil fuels, oil and coal currently account for the
majority of total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the developing world, and they are projected to
remain the dominant sources of emissions throughout
the forecast period. China and India are expected to continue to rely heavily on domestic coal supplies for electricity generation and industrial activities. Most other
developing regions are expected to continue to depend
on oil to meet the majority of their energy needs, especially in light of the projected increase in transportation
energy demand.
31 27
Soviet-era nuclear reactors are retired in the coming
years. As a result, both natural gas and oil are projected
to account for increasing shares of the regions total carbon dioxide emissions, reaching 53 percent and 26 percent, respectively, by 2025.

The largest increases in energy consumption and carbon
emissions are projected for China, given the expectations for continued economic expansion and population
growth. Coal reserves are abundant in China, and access
to other energy fuels is limited in many parts of the
country. In Central and South America, carbon dioxide
emissions are expected to double between 2001 and
2025 as a result of increasing energy demand and shifts
in the mix of energy fuels consumed. Many countries in
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Central and South America, most notably Brazil, have
relied heavily on hydropower to provide the majority of
their electricity in the past; but by 2025 natural gas is
expected to be a larger part of the regions energy mix.
order to meet their emission targets, the Kyoto Protocol
allows the use of three flexibility mechanisms (sometimes called Kyoto mechanisms or market-based
mechanisms):
Future levels of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in many countries are likely to differ significantly
from IEO2003 projections if measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are enacted, such as those outlined
under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The
Kyoto Protocol, which calls for limitations on greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) for
developed countries and some countries with economies in transition, could have profound effects on the
future fuel use of countries that ratify the protocol.
Because the Kyoto Protocol has not yet come into force,
the IEO2003 projections do not reflect the potential
effects of the treaty or of any other proposed climate
change policy measures.
International emissions trading allows Annex I countries to transfer some of their allowable emissions to
other Annex I countries, beginning in 2008, for the
cost of an emission credit. For example, an Annex I
country that reduces its 2010 greenhouse gas emissions level by 10 million metric tons carbon equivalent more than needed to meet its target level can sell
the surplus emission reductions to other Annex I
countries.
Issues in Energy-Related
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Policy
International Climate Change Negotiations
The world communitys effort to address global climate
change has taken place largely under the auspices of the
UNFCCC, which was adopted in May 1992 at the first
Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and entered
into force in March 1994. The ultimate objective of the
UNFCCC is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system [3]. That objective was reinforced during the
second Earth Summit held in Johannesburg, South
Africa, during the summer of 2002, where the world
community reaffirmed its commitment to the principles
of the Framework Convention (see box on page 161). The
most ambitious proposal coming out of the annual conferences held to implement the UNFCCC has been the
Kyoto Protocol, which was developed in December
1997 at the Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3). The
terms of the Kyoto Protocol call for Annex I countries
to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions by at
least 5 percent below 1990 levels over the 2008 to 2012
period. Quantified emissions targets are differentiated
by country.32
In addition to any domestic emission reduction measures that Annex I parties may choose to implement in
The clean development mechanism (CDM) allows
Annex I countries, through governments or other
legal entities, to invest in emission reduction or sink
enhancement projects in non-Annex I countries, gain
credit for those foreign emissions reductions, and
then apply the credits toward their own national
emission reduction commitments.
Joint implementation (JI) is similar to the clean development mechanism, but the investment in emission
reduction projects must occur within the Annex I
countries.
The Kyoto targets refer to overall greenhouse gas emission levels, which encompass emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Hence, a
country may opt for relatively greater reductions of
other greenhouse gas emissions and smaller reductions
of carbon dioxide emissions, or vice versa, in order to
meet its Kyoto obligation. Currently, carbon dioxide
emissions account for the majority of greenhouse gas
emissions in most Annex I countries, followed by methane and nitrous oxide [4].
Changes in emission levels resulting from humaninduced actions that release carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases or remove them from the atmosphere
via sinks (trees, plants, and soils) are also allowed as
reductions under the Protocol, subject to certain restrictions. The extent to which each Annex I party makes use
of sinks and the mechanisms for counting the offsets will
influence the amounts needed in domestic emission
reductions needed to comply with the Protocol.
Details of the operation of the Kyoto Protocol have been
the subject of several UNFCCC meetings since COP-3.
32 The Annex I nations include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, European
Community, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Turkey and Belarus, which are represented under Annex I of the UNFCCC, do not face quantified emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol includes emission targets for 4 countries not listed under Annex Inamely,
Croatia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and Slovenia. Collectively, the 39 parties facing specific emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol are
commonly referred to as Annex B parties, because their targets were specified in Annex B of the Protocol.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
The finalized agreements reached by the end of COP-7,
held in Marrakech, Morocco, in fall 2001 stipulate that
forests, cropland, and grazing land management can be
used to increase the amount of carbon sequestered in
biologic sinks during the first commitment period
(2008-2012), subject to some country-specific upper
bounds; afforestation and reforestation projects can be
eligible for the CDM; and no quantitative limits can be
placed on JI, CDM, and emissions credit trading as
means of meeting the Kyoto commitments. The Bonn
Johannesburg, South Africa, 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development
From August 26 to September 6, 2002, the United
Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development
was held in Johannesburg, South Africa. Its objective
was to review progress on sustainable development
commitments made at earlier international meetingssuch as the UN Conference on Environment and
Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992)and to develop
an action plan for protecting the environment and
eradicating poverty in coming decades, which is the
goal of sustainable development.a
The summit produced few hard targets or timetables.
In particular, no further commitments were made to
address the issue of climate change aside from a general reaffirmation of the principles of the UNFCCC and
a statement by countries that have ratified the Kyoto
Protocol strongly urging other states to follow
suit. Several of the decisions that were adopted,b
as summarized below, will have implications for
future energy use in developed and developing
countries.
Renewable Energy: Diversify energy supply and substantially increase the global share of renewable
energy sources.
Access to Energy: Improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and
environmentally sound energy services and resources, sufficient to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals, including the goal of halving
the proportion of people in poverty by 2015.
Energy Markets: Remove market distortions, including restructuring of energy taxes and phasing out
harmful subsidies.
Specific funding initiatives from the summit that target
the energy sector are described in the table below.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
A few Kyoto Protocol issues remain unresolved, some of
which can be finalized only when the Protocol has
entered into force. They include targets and procedures
for subsequent commitment periods, accounting rules
for carbon sink projects, and whether the consequences
for noncompliance in meeting national emission reduction targets should be legally binding. A new debate
over next steps in the development of a climate change
regime was introduced during the 2002 COP-8 meeting
in New Delhi, India, including discussion of binding
commitments for developing countries (see box below).
104 countries had ratified the Protocol, including Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South
Korea, and the European Union. A total of 30 Annex I
countries, representing 43.9 percent of total 1990 carbon
dioxide emissions, have signed on to the treaty (Figure
86). Two major Annex I countries, Australia and the
United States, have announced that they will not adopt
the Kyoto Protocol, leaving Russia as the deciding factor
for entry into force. With its 17.4 percent of 1990 Annex I
carbon dioxide emissions, Russias ratification of the
Protocol would bring the total to 61.3 percent and enable
the Kyoto Protocol to enter into forceregardless of the
American and Australian decision not to participate.
The Russian President has announced Russias intention
to ratify the treaty, but the timing of such action is still
uncertain [5].
The Kyoto Protocol enters into force 90 days after it has
been ratified by at least 55 Parties to the UNFCCC,
including a representation of Annex I countries accounting for at least 55 percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide
emissions from the Annex I group. As of February 2003,
Although the United States has announced that it will
not participate in the Kyoto Protocol, the government
has introduced a series of alternative measures to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. In 2001, President Bush committed the U.S. government to the pursuit of a broad
agreement also calls for 2 percent of the revenues raised
from certified emission reductions issued for any CDM
project to go toward a fund for climate change adaptation projects in developing countries.
COP-8 Climate Change Negotiations in New Delhi, India
The Eighth Session of the Conference of Parties
(COP-8) to the UNFCCC was held in New Delhi, India,
from October 23 to November 1, 2002, to continue discussion on the Kyoto Protocol and implementation of
the UNFCCC. With the Kyoto Protocol not yet in force,
agenda items focused mostly on technical issues that
had been left out of the Kyoto agreements of COP-6.5
and COP-7. Notable decisions include:
Kyoto Protocol:
Rules for small-scale CDM projects and accreditation procedures for operational entities.
Guidelines for tracking emission transfers in a uniform format to allow linkage of JI, CDM, and emissions trading activities in national emission
registries.
Procedures for expert review of registries to assess
compliance with requirements on commitment
period reserves to avoid overselling of allowances.
UNFCCC:
Guidance for two of the three new developing
country funds (the least developed countries fund
and the special climate change fund) established at
COP-7.
Invitation to the IPCC and the Montreal Protocols
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to
undertake a special report on hydrofluorocarbons
and perfluorocarbons.
Political discussions also focused on potential next
steps in the development of a climate change regime,
including a debate on the proposed Delhi Ministerial
Declaration designed to shape the direction of future
negotiations. While the Indian government focused
negotiations around developing country concerns,
such as vulnerability and adaptation to the effects of
climate change, developed countries, led by the EU,
focused on the need to develop longer term commitments beyond the first Kyoto commitment period.
In particular, the EU proposed the development of a
broader, more inclusive, and balanced process for commitments after 2012, opening the door for inclusion of
developing countries in future commitments. This suggestion was met with strong resistance by developing
countries. The final Delhi Ministerial Declaration on
Climate Change thus excludes references to forwardlooking strategies and instead reaffirms and highlights
the need for sustainable economic and social development in the developing countries and increased support for adaptation measures.

range of strategies to address the issues of global climate
change, launching three initiatives: the Climate Change
Research Initiative to accelerate science-based climate
change policy development; the National Climate
Change Technology Initiative to advance energy and
sequestration technology development; and increased
international cooperation to engage and support other
nations on climate change research and clean technologies [6].
On February 14, 2002, President Bush announced the
Administrations Global Climate Change Initiative,
which calls on the United States to reduce greenhouse
gas intensity (total greenhouse gas emissions per unit of
gross domestic product) by 18 percent between 2002 and
2012, primarily through voluntary measures (see box
below). Under the Global Climate Change Initiative, the
President directed the Secretary of Energy to propose
improvements in the Department of Energys Voluntary
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program to enhance the
accuracy, reliability, and verifiability of emission reduction measurements reported to the program. Reforms to
the program are to ensure that businesses and individuals registering reductions will not be penalized under a
future climate policy, and to give transferable credits to
companies that can show real emission reductions [7, 8].
On February 12, 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy, on
behalf of President Bush, launched the Presidents Climate VISION (Voluntary Innovative Sector Initiatives:
Opportunities Now). Climate VISION is a voluntary,
public-private partnership to pursue cost-effective initiatives to reduce the projected growth in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The program, to be administered
through the Department of Energy, is intended to help
meet the Presidents goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse
gas intensity by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012. It
involves Federal agencies, including the Department of
Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Department
of Agriculture, and Department of Transportation,
working with industrial partners to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions voluntarily over the next decade. Industry
groups making commitments include the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers, Aluminum Association,
American Chemistry Council, American Forest and
Paper Association, American Iron and Steel Institute,
American Petroleum Institute, American Public Power
Association, Association of American Railroads, Business Roundtable, Edison Electric Institute, Electric
Power Supply Association, Magnesium Coalition and
the International Magnesium Association, National
Mining Association, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Nuclear Energy Institute, Portland
U.S. Greenhouse Gas Intensity Target
In February 2002, President Bush introduced the Climate Change Initiative to address the issue of global
warming. As a cornerstone of the initiative, the President set a target of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy by 18 percent over the next 10
years.a Greenhouse gas intensity measures the ratio of
greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent)
to economic output (dollars of gross domestic product). The intensity-based greenhouse gas reduction target can be met without reducing or stabilizing annual
U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, so long as annual economic growth is greater than the increase in emissions.
The greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy has
declined steadily in past decades, and continued
declines are expected in the future. The Bush Administrations proposal assumes that, with business-asusual emissions rates, greenhouse gas intensity will
decline by 14 percent between 2002 and 2012. Measures
included in the Climate Change Initiative are expected
to reduce the intensity by an additional 4 percent, by
producing an absolute reduction in emissions of 100
million metric tons carbon equivalent in 2012 and more
than 500 million metric tons cumulatively over the
2002-2012 period.

Many other Annex I countries have initiated measures
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet projected
emissions targets. Policies target all areas of energy use
in industry, energy production, transportation, and
buildings. Table 29 highlights some of the measures
taken by individual countries.
The IEO2003 reference case projections indicate that
energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from the entire
Annex I group of countries will exceed the groups 1990
emissions level by 14 percent in 2010 (Figure 87). Taking
the prescribed Kyoto emission reduction targets on the
basis of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions alone,
the industrialized Annex I countries would face an emission limit of 2,575 million metric tons carbon dioxide
equivalent in 2010, or 25 percent less than their projected
baseline emissions. On the other hand, energy-related
carbon dioxide emissions from the group of transitional
Annex I countries have been decreasing since 1990 as a
result of economic and political crises in the EE/FSU.
The combined Kyoto Protocol reduction target for the
transitional Annex I countries is 10 percent below their
projected 2010 baseline emissions. Of the industrialized
Annex I countries, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom had reduced
energy-related carbon dioxide emissions below their
1990 levels in 2000.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading
At COP-7 in Marrakech, it was established that international emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol could
start as of 2008. In advance of any international emissions trading under the Protocol, however, some Annex
I parties have established or are in the process of establishing their own internal greenhouse gas emissions
trading programs. The economic rationale behind emissions trading is to reduce the costs associated with
achieving a set reduction in greenhouse gases. Trading
works by encouraging the covered participants with
low-cost options to reduce their emission levels to below
their allotted share and to make the surplus reductions

available to participants whose reduction options are
more costly.
One framework for emissions trading is cap and
trade, whereby a regulatory authority would establish
a permanent cap on aggregate emissions for a group of
emitters. The cap could, for example, be set at a fraction
of the historic emissions from the group of participants.
The cap would be divided into a set number of allowances, each of which would give the holder the right to
emit a specified quantity of the regulated pollutant in a
given compliance period. In the case of greenhouse gas
emissions, each allowance could grant the holder the
right to emit 1 metric ton carbon dioxide equivalent.
Once distributed among the participants, the allowances
could be bought, sold, or (possibly) banked for future
use. At the end of each compliance period, each participant would be required to hold allowances equal to its
actual emissions or else face a penalty. Although it has
not been used to achieve a mandatory large-scale reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the cap and trade system is not new, having been used in the United States
since the 1990s to achieve reductions in stationarysource emissions of sulfur dioxide and in the fisheries
industry. In the late 1980s New Zealand introduced an
individual transferable quota (ITQ) system for managing fisheries, setting a total allowable catch and allocating tradable shares to individual fishermen. The system
has since been emulated in more than 75 countries [9].
Emissions trading could also be based on concepts other
than cap and trade. For example, a credit-based emissions trading system would include both capped and
non-capped industries and entities that would trade voluntarily created, permanent emission reductions legally
recognized by a regulator. This system would allow
entities with emissions increases to obtain offsetting
reductions from other entities. Other trading variants
include baseline emissions trading systems, which
would allow entities to reduce emissions below a level
that would otherwise occur under business as usual, and
then trade the emission reductions. Rate-based emissions trading would focus on emissions per unit of output rather than absolute emissions, allowing entities
that improved their efficiency beyond target levels to
trade the excess improvement with other entities.
In October 2001, the European Commission of the EU
released a final proposal for establishing its own internal
greenhouse gas emissions trading system [10]. The first
trial phase of the scheme would run from 2005 through
2007, regulating carbon dioxide emissions from all heat
and electricity generators over 20 megawatts of rated
thermal input capacity and from all refineries, coke
ovens, iron and steel production processes, pulp and
paper plants, and mineral industry installations. The
proposal would require operators of such installations
to hold permits as a condition for emitting greenhouse
gases. The second phase of the scheme would be concurrent with the first compliance period under the Kyoto
Protocol (2008-2012), should it come into force, and each
subsequent phase would last for 5 years.
The EU member states would determine the quantity of
allowances to be issued in each phase. Noncompliance
sanctions would be applied to any installation that did
not have enough allowances to cover actual emissions
each year. The allowances, which would be tradable
across the entire EU, could be banked from year to year
within each phase, and across phases if individual member states decided to do so.
In fall 2002, the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers separately approved the Commissions proposal, adding a number of amendments to the scheme
[11]. For example, the Council of Ministers voted for
mandatory participation by Member States from 2005,
but inserted the provision that Member States should
have limited rights to exempt individual sectors, activities, or installations until 2008 if comparable emission
reductions were already being undertaken. Moreover,
the Council would allow Member States to include additional sectors and other greenhouse gases only after
2008, contradicting an earlier Parliamentary amendment to do so by 2005. On the issue of permit allocation,
the Parliament introduced a hybrid scheme wherebyfor the whole of the 2005-2012 period15 percent
of the permits should be auctioned and the rest allocated
for free. However, the Council of Ministers would limit
auctioning to 10 percent, and only during the second
phase. The directive is pending final approval by the
European Parliament and could be delayed until 2004 if
the Council and Parliament have difficulties reaching an
agreement.
The EU proposal was designed to be compatible with
international emissions trading under the Kyoto framework; however, any other agreements recognizing third
countries emission trading schemes must be subject to
ratification of the Protocol, effectively excluding participation by non-Kyoto countries (such as Australia and
the United States). Moreover, the proposal is open to the
use of the Kyoto Protocols project mechanisms, perhaps
as early as the first phase, although the use of carbon
sinks or nuclear projects may be excluded.
In conjunction with the introduction of the EU trading
program, several EU member countries, including
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom, are considering
development of their own national trading programs.
Non-EU countries, including Japan, Norway, and
Slovakia, have also announced that they intend to
establish trading systems. Currently, Denmark is the
only country that has instituted a mandatory cap and
trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
electricity producers [12]. A cap of 22 million metric tons
of carbon dioxide was set for 2001, with reductions of 1
million metric tons per year during the 3-year life of the
program. The trading system became operational in
April 2001 and will run through 2003. Free allowances
were allocated to eight firms, based on their fuel consumption and actual emissions during the 1994-1998
period, excluding emissions from puchased power. If
the program is extended, its allowances are likely to be
compatible with the proposed EU trading scheme.
The compatibility of the EU proposal with the United
Kingdoms voluntary emissions trading program,
which entered into effect in April 2002, is more questionable. The programs differ in several respects, including
rules for participation, generation of allowances, and
sectoral coverage. Under the British program, any company can opt to enter the trading scheme by negotiating
energy efficiency targets or absolute emission reduction
targets in return for incentive payments offered by the
government. Companies can report on direct emissions
and indirect emissions from imported energy and will
earn tradable allowances for carbon dioxide equivalent
reductions computed against their targets. Also in contrast to the EU proposal, the UK scheme is based on voluntary targets, includes all six Protocol gases, and
excludes combined heat and power generators, except
for emissions from electricity usage that is generated
and used on-site.
In anticipation of entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol,
private firms and national governments have started
investing in greenhouse gas reduction projects and trading in greenhouse gas offset credits, contributing to the
emergence of a nascent market in the credits. Since 1996,
more than 280 carbon transactions have taken place,
amounting to some 335 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent emission reductions [13]. About half
of the trades were negotiated in 2002. Major market drivers include the UK emissions trading scheme, the World
Banks Prototype Carbon Fund, and the Dutch
governments ERUPT and CERUPT programs to purchase JI and CDM credits. As illustrated in Table 30,
emission reductions purchased by the Prototype Carbon
Fund range between $3 and $4 per metric ton carbon
dioxide equivalent, and credits purchased by the Dutch
government range between $4 and $5 per metric ton
[14]. As of fall 2002, credits traded in the British system
were valued at about $18 per metric ton.
In general, the focus in the market is shifting from North
America toward Europe, largely because of the U.S.
decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the startup of
the UK emissions trading system, and the proposed
directive for a European-wide trading scheme. In 1996,
100 percent of carbon emissions trades took place in the
United States; in 2002, more than one-half of the 150
carbon deals negotiated in 2002 took place in Europe.
Emissions trading activity in the United States could
increase, however, with the expected opening of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) in spring 2003. CCX is a
voluntary cap and trade program. Participating members will be able to buy and sell greenhouse gas credits to
assist in achieving their emission reduction
commitments.
Abating Other Energy-Related Emissions
Many countries currently have policies or regulations in
place that limit energy-related emissions other than carbon dioxide. Energy-related air pollutants that have
received particular attention include nitrogen oxides,
sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic
compounds, because of their contribution to ozone and
smog formation, acid rain, and various human health
problems (see Table 31 for a summary of the possible
health and environmental effects of these pollutants).
Moreover, in some countries regulation of mercury
emissions associated with energy combustion has
recently become an issue. Countries also regulate the
management of spent fuel from nuclear power generation facilities, but in most of the countries with active
nuclear power programs there is no permanent disposal
system for highly radioactive waste. How countries
limit energy-related emissions by legislation and/or
regulation can have significant impacts on energy technology choices and energy use.
Regulated air pollutants can be attributed to a mix of
mobile and stationary energy uses. Nitrogen oxide emissions come from high-temperature combustion processes, such as those that occur in motor vehicles and
power plants; road transportation is generally the single
largest source. Sulfur dioxide is formed during the burning of high-sulfur fuels for electricity generation, metal

smelting, refining, and other industrial processes; coalfired power plants account for the preponderance of sulfur dioxide emissions. Volatile organic compounds are
emitted from a variety of sources, including motor vehicles, chemical plants, refineries, factories, consumer
products, and other industrial sources. Particulate matter can be emitted directly or can be formed indirectly in
the atmosphere: primary particles, such as dust
from roads or elemental carbon (soot) from wood combustion, are emitted directly into the atmosphere; secondary particles are formed in the atmosphere from
primary gaseous emissions. Emissions of mercury can
be attributed to coal-fired boilers, municipal waste
combustors, medical waste incinerators, and manufacturing processes that use mercury as an ingredient or
raw material. Coal-fired boilers contribute the largest
share of mercury emissions [15].
With the tightening of emissions limits on combustion
plants during the 1990s, sulfur dioxide emissions
declined in many industrialized countries. In Europe,
the shift from coal to natural gas for electricity production (most notably, in the United Kingdom and Germany) also contributed to a reduction in the regions
sulfur dioxide emissions. Many industrialized countries
have scheduled further restrictions on sulfur dioxide
emissions from stationary sources to take effect over the
next 10 years.
With the decrease in atmospheric concentrations of
sulfur dioxide in industrialized countries, attention
has shifted to ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulates.
Despite the imposition of emissions regulations, nitrogen oxide emissions rose during the 1990s in many
industrialized countries as a result of continued increases in consumption of transportation fuels. In
Europe, however, the decrease in coal-fired electricity
generation and the introduction of catalytic converters
on vehicles led to a gradual drop in nitrogen oxide emissions [16]. In contrast to the generally rising trend in
nitrogen oxide emissions, emissions of volatile organic
compounds have declined [17]. To continue combating
ground-level ozone formation, several countries plan to
tighten emissions standards for new vehicles over the
coming years (Table 32). Limits on the sulfur content of
gasoline and diesel fuel also are being imposed in order
to ensure the effectiveness of emission control technologies used to meet new vehicle standards (Table 33).
The regulation of mercury emissions from energy use
has recently become an area of particular interest in
industrialized countries. Over the past decade, many
nations have begun to evaluate the potential adverse
effects of mercury on human health and the environment. Major anthropogenic sources of mercury emissions include stationary energy combustion, nonferrous
metal production, pig iron and steel production, cement
production, oil and gas processing, and waste disposal.
Of these, only electricity generation, municipal solid
waste combustion, and oil and gas processing are
related to energy use. In the past, energy-related mercury regulations have focused on municipal solid waste
combustion. However, as coal-fired boilers contribute
the single largest share of both energy-related and
non-energy-related mercury emissions, countries that
rely heavily on coal-fired power generation are beginning to consider limits on mercury emissions from
power plants [18] (see box on page 169).

United States
In the United States, the main initiatives to reduce air
pollution stem from the 1970 Clean Air Actthe comprehensive Federal law that regulates air emissions from
stationary and mobile sourcesand the subsequent
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90), which
designate stricter emissions goals and standards across a
wider range of pollutants.
In the sections related to stationary energy use, the Clean
Air Act and its amendments address all the major air
quality issues, such as acid rain, ground level ozone, and
visibility. The Acid Rain Program, introduced under
Title IV of CAAA90, regulates both sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides. The program sets a goal of reducing
annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons
below 1980 levels and annual nitrogen oxide emissions
by 2 million tons below 1980 levels. The program also
specifies a two-phase reduction in emissions from fossil-fired electric power plants greater than 25 megawatts
capacity and from all new power plants. Phase II of the
program, which began in January 2000, lowered the total
allowable level of sulfur dioxide emissions from all electricity generators, capping annual U.S. emissions at 8.95
million metric tons by 2010.33 The sulfur dioxide regulations include a highly successful market-based regulatory program, which allows individual plant operators
to reduce their emissions through any combination of
strategies, including installation of scrubbers, switching
to low-sulfur fuels, and emissions allowance trading

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Controlling Emissions of Mercury from Energy Use
In response to scientific research indicating potential
adverse ecological and human health impacts caused
by exposure to mercury, many nations are considering
regulation and control of mercury emissionsincluding those attributed to energy use.
Recent estimates of global mercury emissions indicate
that Europe and North America contribute less than 25
percent of global anthropogenic emissions (see table
below). The majority of emissions originate from combustion of fossil fuels, particularly in Asian countries
that rely heavily on coal for electricity generation,
including China, India, and South and North Korea.a
Other sources of mercury include processing of mineral resources at high temperatures, such as roasting
and smelting of ores, kiln operations in the cement
industry, incineration of waste materials, and production of certain chemicals.
Traditionally, regulation of energy-related mercury
emissions has focused on municipal solid waste combustion.b Mercury is found in relatively higher concentrations in waste incineration exhaust gases than in the
gases released from coal combustion and is thus simpler and less expensive to remove. As a result, most
industrialized and many developing countries already
have standards in place to control mercury levels in the
exhaust gases from waste incineration facilities and in
wastewater from the cleaning of their exhaust gases
(see table on continuation page).c
A number of countries, including Canada, the United
States, and the European Union, are now considering
standards to control mercury emissions from coal-fired
electricity generators:d
Under the umbrella of the Canadian Council of
Ministers of the Environment, federal, provincial,
and territorial governments in Canada are working
on developing a nationwide emission standard for
the coal-fired electricity generation sector by the
end of 2005.
The United States is debating various multipollutant legislative initiatives, with mercury as
one of the targeted pollutants. On December 14,
2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
announced the decision that it is appropriate and
necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants
(including mercury) from electric utility power
plants.e A regulation is currently scheduled for proposal by December 15, 2003, and promulgation by
December 15, 2004.
The European Union is in the process of developing
emissions monitoring procedures and control strategies based on Best Available Technology (BAT)
as part of a daughter directive under the 1996
Air Quality Framework Directive (96/62/EC).

and banking. This cap and trade approach, which
allows emitters to choose the most cost-effective means
for limiting sulfur dioxide emissions, has led to a
24-percent decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions between
1992 and 2001 [19].
Specifications for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions
under the Acid Rain Program are also scheduled according to two phases. As with the sulfur dioxide rules, the
Phase II nitrogen oxide limits, targeting certain
coal-fired utility boilers, became effective in January
2000; however, the nitrogen oxide program neither sets
an emissions cap nor incorporates emissions allowance
trading as a compliance option. The program requires
utility boilers to meet a specified nitrogen oxide emissions rate, depending on boiler capacity, providing flexibility for utilities by focusing on the emission rate to be
achieved.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
also taken two actions to address the effects of interstate
transport of nitrogen oxide emissions on downwind
ozone nonattainment areas. In 1998, the EPA finalized
the nitrogen oxides SIP call rules, which now require
19 States and the District of Columbia to revise their
State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to control summertime nitrogen oxide emissions. In a separate action,
aimed at the same interstate nitrogen oxides transport
problem, the EPA in December 1999 found that emissions from large electric generating units and large
industrial boilers and turbines in 12 States and the District of Columbia are significantly contributing to downwind States ozone nonattainment problems. The rule
requires the sources to control summertime nitrogen
oxide emissions under the Federal Nitrogen Oxides
Budget Trading Program, beginning May 1, 200334 [20].
Additional requirements for electric power plant operators to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions beyond the levels called for in current regulations
are being considered at Federal levels (see box on page
171). It is envisioned that the new regulations will eliminate several of the individual programs that apply to the
power generation sector and replace them with a less
burdensome administrative system.
Controlling Emissions of Mercury from Energy Use (Continued)
To address transboundary issues related to the
long-range transport of mercury emissions, countries
are also working under the auspices of the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to develop
a global assessment of mercury and its compounds.
The assessment, to include options for addressing any
significant global adverse impacts of mercury, was
presented to the UNEP Governing Council at its 22nd
session in February 2003 for further action by the
global community. A meeting of UNEPs Working
Group on Mercury took place in Geneva, Switzerland
in September 2002 to develop options for addressing

34 Under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, States may petition the EPA to mitigate significant regional transport of nitrogen oxides. In
May 1999, the EPA established the Federal Nitrogen Oxides Budget Trading Program as the general control remedy for reducing interstate
ozone transport and required 392 facilities in the northeast to participate in the NOX emissions cap-and-trade program.

Multipollutant Control Legislation in the United States
Electric power plant operators in the United States may
face new requirements to reduce emissions of sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury beyond the levels called for in current regulations. Some current Federal legislative initiatives also require mandatory
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Whereas in the
past each pollutant was addressed through a separate
regulatory program, the new legislative initiatives
focus on simultaneous reductions of multiple emissions in order to reduce the cost and administrative
burden of compliance. The legislative initiatives now
being considered would either override or streamline
the 1990 Clean Air Acts New Source Review requirements for modernization at power plants built before
the Clean Air Act and exempt from its regulations.
Three major legislative initiatives have been introduced in Congress during the 107th legislative session
and have been referred to committee for further consideration. A fourth was announced early in the 108th
Congress. Introduced first by Senators Jeffords and
Lieberman in 2002 and later in 2003, the Clean Power
Act of 2003 is the most far-reaching of the multipollutant initiatives. As shown in the table below, it
covers emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
mercury, and carbon dioxide. The bill proposes a cap
and trade scheme for meeting sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxide, and carbon dioxide emission targets and a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)
requirement to reduce mercury emissions. The current
Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt a performance standard based on
MACT in the next few years, with compliance required
by the end of 2007. In addition, the Clean Power Act of
2003 would require every power plant to be equipped
with the most recent pollution controls required for
new sources by the plants 40th year of operation or by
2014, whichever is later.
The Clear Skies Initiative, announced by President
Bush in February 2002 and introduced as House and
Senate bills, proposes nationwide caps for sulfur dioxide and mercury and regional (East and West) caps for
nitrogen oxides. The Clear Skies Initiative differs from
the proposed Clean Power Act primarily in targeted
emission reductions and proposed compliance dates.
The final nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide targets are
close to those proposed in the Clean Power Act of 2003,
but mercury reductions are not as stringent, and the
timetable for reaching the targets is delayed by 5 to 10
years, depending on the pollutant. The Clear Skies

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
In an effort to address the EPA requirement to promulgate mercury regulations by 2004, the proposed regulations will also for the first time target emissions of
mercury from stationary combustion. The CAAA90
required the EPA to study and prepare a report to Congress on the hazards to human health that can reasonably be expected to occur as a result of emissions of
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from fossil-fuel-fired
electric power plants. In its December 2000 report to
Congress, the EPA found that HAP control is appropriate for coal-fired and oil-fired utility boilers, with a particular focus on mercury emissions. A regulation is
currently scheduled for proposal by December 15, 2003,
and promulgation by December 15, 2004. In order to
ensure that optimal alternatives will be available to
reduce mercury emissions, an interagency effort is
underway to develop maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) options for inclusion in future
regulation.
Because particulate matter consists of many different
particles, and volatile organic compounds contribute to
both particulate matter and ozone, the EPA sets general
national ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter that apply to metropolitan areas,
rather than specifying emissions limits for individual
polluters. It is then up to States and urban jurisdictions
to regulate local emitters. In 1997 the EPA issued new
ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and
ozone. The ozone standard was tightened from 0.12
parts per million measured over 1 hour to 0.08 parts per
million measured over 8 hours. In addition, the EPA
added two new standards for particles with diameters of
2.5 micrometers or less, set at 15 micrograms per cubic
meter and 65 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively,
for the annual and 24-hour standards. These were added
to the existing requirements for particles with diameters
of 10 micrometers or less, which were set at 50 micrograms per cubic meter and 150 micrograms per cubic
meter, respectively, for the annual and 24-hour
standards.
Beginning in 2002, based on 3 years of monitored data,
the EPA will designate areas as nonattainment that do
not meet the new particulate matter standards. Moreover, based on new scientific evidence, the EPA has proposed revisions to both standards and is developing a
two-phase, integrated implementation strategy for
ozone, particulate matter, and regional haze programs.
Currently, it is expected that nonattainment areas will be
designated sometime between 2003 and 2005, and SIPs
will have to be submitted to the EPA 2 to 3 years beyond
that date. As a result, further emission reductions probably will not be required until sometime between 2007
and 2010.
CAAA90 also designates more stringent emissions standards for motor vehicles. The Tier 1 standards cover
emissions of several pollutants from light-duty vehicles,
beginning with model year 1994. Tighter Tier 2 standards, which are about 90 percent cleaner than Tier 1,
will be phased in starting in 2004, marking the first time
that cars and light-duty trucks will be subject to the same
national pollution control system. The current emissions
standards for heavy-duty vehicles, which have been in
place since 1998, will be further tightened in two stages:
Multi-Pollutant Legislation in the United States (Continued)
provides for market-based cap and trade programs for
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide and also provides
for mercury emissions trading. It includes carbon dioxide emission provisions that would be voluntary only.
The third bill, the Clean Air Planning Act of 2003, was
introduced by Senator Tom Carper in October 2002
and later in April 2003. It has been promoted as a bipartisan bill that presents a compromise between the Clear
Skies Initiative and the Clean Power Act. It would
establish aggressive caps on emissions on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, but they would be
phased in over a longer period than proposed in the
Clean Power Act. The bill would also introduce limited
caps on carbon dioxide emissions. The bill proposes to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 2005 levels by 2008
and to 2001 levels by 2012, whereas the Clean power
Act would reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1999
levels by 2008. The nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and
mercury reduction targets and timelines included in
the legislation are more aggressive than those outlined
in the Presidents Clear Skies Initiative but less stringent than those proposed in the Clean Power Act.
In early January 2003, Senators McCain and Lieberman
introduced legislation to reduce annual emissions of
greenhouse gases by emitters in the electricity, transportation, industrial, and commercial sectors who produce 10,000 metric tons carbon equivalent or more per
year.a The bill would create a system of tradable allowances allocated to emitters in each sector free of charge,
with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to
2000 levels by 2010 and to 1990 levels by 2016. It does
not address emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, or mercury.

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
a new combined nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon emission standard will take effect in 2004, and further emission reductions will be phased in starting in 2007 [21, 22].
Monetary penalties will be imposed on manufacturers
of heavy-duty trucks and buses that are unable to meet
the tighter emissions standards.
Concurrent with the introduction of Tier 2 emissions
standards, the U.S. government is requiring a reduction
in the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel used for
transportation [23, 24]. The lower sulfur content will
enable the effective use of modern pollution-control
technology required for meeting the Tier 2 standards
and will significantly reduce formation of smog and particulate matter. The new gasoline sulfur standard will be
phased in between 2004 and 2007, in order to ease the
transition for domestic refineries. According to the new
standard, refiners and importers must produce a
97-percent reduction in the sulfur content of highway
diesel by June 1, 2006, although the law incorporates a
phase-in period and hardship provisions for small refiners through May 2010. In addition to these rules, the EPA
also expects to tighten regulations for nonroad vehicles
to reduce ozone and particulate matter emissions [25].
Canada
In Canada, emissions from stationary sources are regulated under the Thermal Power Generation Emissions
National Guidelines for New Stationary Sources of the
1993 Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA).
In January 2003, the emission guidelines for new sources
of electricity generation were updated, tightening emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter from new coal-, oil-, and gas-fired
steam-electric power plants [26]. The new emission targets would lower sulfur dioxide emissions by 75 percent, to a rate of 4.24, 2.65, or 0.53 kilogram per
megawatthour, depending on the energy content and
sulfur concentration of the fuel used. Emissions of nitrogen oxide would be lowered by 60 percent, to a rate of
0.69 kilogram per megawatthour, and emissions of particulate matter would be lowered by 80 percent, to 0.095
kilogram per megawatthour. With these requirements,
the long-term emission performance of all fossil-fired
generation is targeted to approach that of natural gas.
Additional efforts to abate sulfur dioxide emissions
have focused on the seven easternmost provinces, where
smog levels are on the rise and acid rain is a concern.35
The Eastern Canada Acid Rain Program placed a
region-wide cap on sulfur dioxide emissions at 2.3 million metric tons per year for 1994, mostly restricting
emissions from large industrial facilities. Recently, new
measures at provincial levels were enacted to reduce
nitrogen oxide emissions. Starting in 2007, fossil-fueled
power plants in central and southern Ontario will face
an annual cap of 39,000 tons, and emissions from plants
in southern Quebec will be capped at 5,000 tons.
Addressing the problems of acid rain and ground-level
ozone in Canada has required cooperation with the
United States, given the transboundary flow of air pollutants between the two countries. Actions taken under
the various sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide programs
of the U.S. CAAA90 have supplemented Canadas
domestic efforts. In addition, a December 2002 crossborder agreement between Canada and the United
States set a target of cutting ozone in the U.S./Canada
transboundary region by 43 percent by 2010 [27]. The
agreement was seen as a major step toward harmonizing
air quality standards for stationary and mobile sources,
and negotiators have begun discussing its expansion to
cover other pollutants.
Canadian regulation of mobile sources tends to mirror
standards in the United States, in line with efforts to create an integrated vehicle manufacturing market in
North America. Starting with the 1998 model year, regulations for light-duty vehicles were aligned with the Tier
1 standards of the United States. According to a regulation introduced in January 2003, model year 2004 and
later vehicles will be required to meet the U.S. Tier 2
standards taking effect that same year [28]. In addition,
the Canadian government has reached an agreement
with vehicle manufacturers to equip new light-duty
vehicles and trucks with the same emissions control and
monitoring equipment needed to meet the U.S. Federal
emissions standards for the 2001-2003 model years. In
1999, Canada approved a limit of 30 parts per million of
sulfur content in gasoline, which would take effect by
January 1, 2005. The average level of sulfur in Canadian
gasoline is currently 350 parts per million, among the
highest in the industrialized world. Canada will also
require a diesel fuel sulfur cap of 15 parts per million by
June 2006, mirroring the U.S. highway diesel regulation.
Mexico
Air pollution in the large cities of Mexico is a serious
concern for the country. Mexico City, Guadalajara, and
Ciudad Juarez are the most polluted, and Mexico Citys
air quality is among the worst in the world. Although
industrial growth is causing increased environmental
damage, transportation continues to be the largest
source of emissions, contributing an estimated 70 percent of the local air pollution in Mexico City and the surrounding valley [29].
The Mexican government has presented several innovative proposals for fighting air pollution from transportation, including tax incentives for using cleaner fuels and
35 The seven Canadian provinces covered under the Eastern Canada Acid Rain Program are Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island.
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
smog control measures. In major urban centers, private
car drivers are required to have catalytic converters or
refrain from driving one day a week. In addition, dozens
of manufacturers are taking advantage of government
subsidies to outfit gasoline-powered delivery trucks
with cleaner liquefied petroleum gas. The pollution control measures put in place in the mid-1990s have already
improved visibility and air quality in Mexico City.
Mexican environmental initiatives also include developing clean taxis and small buses in order to reduce urban
emissions. Mexico began producing cars with emissions
controls in 1991. Since then, Pemex, the national oil company, has been reducing production of leaded gasoline.
The company is in the process of desulfurizing crude oil
at the Tula refinery and has replaced its high-sulfur diesel with a new Pemex diesel that contains only 0.05
percent sulfur.
Europe
In Europe, efforts to limit aggregate emissions of sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds,
and particulate matter were first coordinated under the
1979 United Nations/European Economic Commissions Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air
Pollution (CLRTAP), which was drafted after scientists
demonstrated the link between sulfur dioxide emissions
in continental Europe and the acidification of Scandinavian lakes. Since its entry into force, the Convention has
been extended by eight protocols that set emissions limits for a variety of pollutants. The 1999 Gothenburg
Protocol calls for national emissions ceilings for sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds,
and ammonia. As with previous CLRTAP protocols, the
Gothenburg Protocol specifies tight limit values for specific emissions sources based on the critical loads concept, and requires best available technologies to be used
to achieve the emissions reductions. As of January 2003,
only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden had
ratified the Gothenburg Protocol.
Parallel to CLRTAP developments, the EU agreed on the
directive for National Emission Ceilings (NEC) for Certain Atmospheric Pollutants (Directive 2001/81/EC) to
reduce overall sulfur dioxide emissions by 63 percent
and cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic
compounds, and ammonia by 40 percent by 2010 [30].
The agreement, which was reached at the end of 2001,
covers the same four pollutants as the Gothenburg Protocol; however, the national emission targets are stricter,
particularly for sulfur dioxide (Table 34). The establishment of national emission ceilings is a regulatory innovation in EU air pollution control, in that the different
emissions ceilings are tailored to meet country-specific
circumstances and allow member countries flexibility in
implementing control measures.
While the NEC directive addresses both stationary and
mobile sources, another EU directive on the Limitation
of Emissions of Certain Pollutants into the Air from
Large Combustion Plants (Directive 2001/80/EC0) was
passed in late 2001 targeting only stationary combustion. This directive amended the Large Combustion

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Plant Directive of 1988 (Directive 88/609/EEC), which
imposed emissions limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, and dust on existing and new power plants with
a rated thermal input capacity greater than 50 megawatts. For plants licensed before July 1, 1987, the 1988
directive placed a gradually declining ceiling (cap) on
total annual emissions of each pollutant. The ceiling values differed by country. The directive did not stipulate
how the emissions reductions were to be achieved,
although the general approach used by several European countries has been to require the use of specific
emissions control technologies and combustion fuels.
All plants licensed after July 1, 1987, faced uniform emissions limit values, which were set according to plant
capacity, size, and fuel type.
The new directive was seen as a package deal, along
with the 2001 directive on NECs, toward the development of a comprehensive EU acidification strategy. The
directive takes into account advances in combustion and
abatement technologies and reduces the nitrogen oxides
limit values for large solid fuel plants from 650 milligrams per cubic meter to 200 milligrams per cubic meter.
This limit, which applies to both new and existing plants
from 2016 onward, will be a crucial benchmark in the
forthcoming negotiations with Eastern European candidate countries hoping to enter the EU. However, existing plants may be exempt from obligations concerning
new emissions standards if they are operated for less
than 20,000 hours between January 2008 and December
2015. The directive does provide member countries with
some flexibility in terms of specifying control technologies but, unlike the U.S. regulatory scheme, does not
include provisions for market-based emission reductions, such as allowance trading.
Emissions from motor vehicles have been regulated in
Europe since the 1970 Motor Vehicle Directive. The most
stringent vehicle emission limits were passed in 1998
and 1999 by Directives 98/69/EC and 99/96/EC. As the
law currently stands, all new vehicles must meet the
Euro 3 emissions standards for carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides by 2000 and 2001,
depending on weight class. Between 2005 and 2008, the
tighter Euro 4 and Euro 5 standards for new vehicles will
take effect. Directive 98/70/EC designates current and
future sulfur content limits for motor fuels. Germany,
the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom
have encouraged the switch to low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel by offering tax incentives. Sweden already requires city diesel to meet the same sulfur standard (50
parts per million) required by the EU in 2005. The EU
recently finalized an amendment to Directive 98/70/EC
that includes the mandatory introduction of sulfur-free
gasoline and diesel fuels, with sulfur levels lower than
10 milligams per kilogram, by January 1, 2005, and a
complete ban on all non-sulfur-free fuels by January 1,
2009 [31, 32]. The implementation of the measure would
coincide with the introduction of Euro 4 vehicles in the
European market.
Australia
In Australia, measures to reduce emissions of sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds,
and particulate matter from energy use have focused on
the transportation sector. Australia relies heavily on
domestic coal for electricity generation, with 60 percent
of its generating capacity being coal-fired [33]; however,
its domestic coal has lower sulfur content than the coal
produced in most other countries, and sulfur dioxide
emissions from power generation are relatively low. The
ambient air concentrations of sulfur dioxide in most
Australian towns and cities usually have remained well
within a level that the government deems to be safe.
On the other hand, because of the health risks associated
with high concentrations of nitrogen oxides, volatile
organic compounds, and particulate matter, particularly
in urban centers, the Australian government has begun
to implement measures to reduce emissions of those pollutants. Approximately 80 percent of the nitrogen dioxide emissions in Australian cities come from motor
vehicle exhaust [34].
Vehicle emissions in Australia are regulated under the
Motor Vehicle Standards Act of 1989. The most stringent
emissions standards for new vehicles were set in December 1999, based on the schedule of vehicle standards
used in the EU. According to the new Australian Design
Rule 79/00, Euro 2 standards for all new light-duty vehicles were phased in according to weight class and fuel
type, starting in 2002. Rule 79/01 applies the Euro 3 standard for all new light-duty gasoline-powered vehicles
starting in 2005 and the Euro 4 standard for all new
light-duty diesel-powered vehicles starting in 2006.
Rules 80/00 and 80/01 similarly phase in Euro 3 and
Euro 4 emissions standards for new medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles.
The high sulfur content of gasoline and diesel in Australia was identified as a particular problem for the effective operation of engine catalysts needed to meet tighter
emission standards. In May 2001, the Australian government announced the first fuel quality standards to be
adopted under the Fuel Quality Standards Act of 2000.
Standards for gasoline and diesel began in 2002, in order
to ensure compatibility between the fuels and vehicle
emissions control technologies.
Japan
In Japan, the regulation of sulfur oxides and other particulate emissions from fuel combustion began after the
passage of the Air Pollution Control Law of 1968.
Emissions standards were established by order of the
Prime Ministers Office and were last amended in 1998.
Limit values for sulfur oxide emissions from stationary
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
sources vary according to the geographic location of the
facility and height of the exhaust stack, and nitrogen
oxide emission limit values vary according to boiler or
furnace type. Sulfur content limits for fuels were
included under the Air Pollution Control Law by
amendments in 1995 and have been in force since 1996.
Vehicle emissions standards for nitrogen oxides, carbon
monoxide, and hydrocarbons were also established by
the Air Pollution Control Law and by the Automobile
Nitrogen Oxide Law of 1992.
China
While emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
particulate matter have either declined or slowed in
most industrialized countries, many developing countries are experiencing rapid growth in energy-related
pollution. Issues of most pressing concern involve growing sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain from
coal-fired power plants and increasing levels of smog
and particulate matter in urban areas caused by transportation and power generation. To address these environmental problems, many developing countries have
introduced regulations targeting motor vehicle use and
coal-fired power generation. However, compliance with
emissions regulations is often low in developing countries, due to limited funding and inadequate means for
measuring emissions levels and enforcing standards
[35]. Thus, in the face of strong population growth and
economic development, emissions of air pollutants in
urban centers of the developing world have increased
steadily.
According to a report by the World Bank, 16 of the
worlds 20 most polluted cities are in China [36]. Sulfur
dioxide and soot caused by coal combustion are two
major air pollutants, resulting in the formation of acid
rain, which now falls on about 30 percent of Chinas total
land area [37]. Ninety percent of the countrys sulfur
dioxide emissions are attributed to coal-fired boilers,
and the government is focusing regulation on sulfur
dioxide emissions from power generation and large
industrial facilities [38].
In 1982 the Chinese government introduced a sulfur
dioxide pollution levy, which became the cornerstone of
national sulfur dioxide control. The levy system has
proven to be only modestly successful at controlling
emissions, because it is applied only to medium-sized
and large sources, it appears to be set too low to encourage significant sulfur dioxide abatement, and the fee is
rarely used for reinvestment in new abatement activities. To improve the system, the levy was changed in
2000 from a fee based on excess emissions to a charge on
total emissions. Moreover, in 2002, China implemented
a new coal policy, which is expected to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions nationwide by 10 percent from 2000
levels by 2005, and by 20 percent within control zones
with high pollution, including Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and 197 other cities [39]. The control zones
account for 11.4 percent of Chinas land area but for 66
percent of the 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide emitted
each year. The new policy increases the pollution levy to
5 yuan (60.4 cents) per ton and requires power companies and large industrial facilities to install
desulfurization equipment [40]. Smaller facilities must
use low-sulfur coal or cleaner fuel alternatives.
In a parallel effort to encourage a switch to cleaner burning fuels, the government has introduced a tax on highsulfur coals. In Beijing, officials aiming to phase out coal
from the city center have established 40 coal-free
zones and have made plans to construct natural gas
pipelines. Similar efforts are underway in other major
Chinese cities. In addition, pilot sulfur dioxide emissions trading programs are underway in Benxi
(Liaoning Province) and Nantong (Jiangsu Province),
and in early 2002 the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) announced that the provinces of
Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Jiangsu, the special
administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong,
and three cities (Shanghai, Tianjin, and Liuzhou) would
pioneer Chinas first cross-provincial border trading
scheme. Rules and a timetable for the pilot trading program have not yet been developed.
China is also moving toward adopting Euro 2 emissions
standards for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles.
Beijing will be the first Chinese city to implement the
new national standards, requiring that all new lightduty and heavy-duty vehicles sold in Beijing after January 1, 2003, comply with the Euro 2 standards. In an
additional effort to reduce air pollution in the city, the
municipal government is ordering city vehicles to convert to liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas.
India
Urban air quality in India ranks among the worlds
poorest [41]. Efforts to improve urban air quality have
focused on vehicles, which account for the majority of
the countrys air pollution. Emissions limits for gasolineand diesel-powered vehicles came into force in 1991 and
1992, respectively. Emissions standards for passenger
cars and commercial vehicles were tightened in 2000 at
levels equivalent to the Euro 1 standards. For the metro
areas of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, tighter
Euro 2 standards have been required since 2001, and the
sulfur content of motor fuels sold in the four metro areas
has also been restricted to 500 parts per million since
2001, in order to be compatible with the tighter vehicle
emissions standards. Since January 2000, motor fuel sulfur content in all other regions of the country has been
limited to 2,500 parts per million.
The measures taken to reduce vehicle emissions in New
Delhi have been more controversial. In 1998, Indias
Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Supreme Court ordered all the citys buses to be run on
compressed natural gas by March 31, 2001. Compliance
was to be achieved either by converting existing diesel
engines or by replacing the buses themselves. Only 200
compressed natural gas buses were available by the initial deadline, however (out of a total fleet of 12,000), and
protests ensued as all other buses were banned from use
[42]. To ease the transition for both bus owners and commuters, the Delhi government is now allowing a gradual
phaseout of the existing diesel bus fleet [43].
Although India is a large coal consumer, its Central Pollution Control Board has not set any sulfur dioxide emissions limits for coal-fired power plants, because most of
the coal mined in India is low in sulfur content.
Coal-fired power plants do not face any nitrogen oxide
emissions limits either, although thermal plants fueled
by natural gas and naphtha face standards between 50
and 100 parts per million, depending on their capacity.
Enforcement of the standards has been recognized as a
major problem in India [44].

Energy Information Administration / International Energy Outlook 2003
Appendix F
System for the Analysis of Global Energy Markets (SAGE)
The projections of world energy consumption appearing
in this years International Energy Outlook (IEO) are based
on the Energy Information Administrations (EIAs)
new international energy modeling tool, System for the
Analysis of Global Energy markets (SAGE). SAGE is an
integrated set of regional models that provide a technology-rich basis for estimating regional energy consumption. For each region, reference case estimates of 42
end-use energy service demands (e.g., car, commercial
truck, and heavy truck road travel; residential lighting;
steam heat requirements in the paper industry) are
developed on the basis of economic and demographic
projections. Projections of energy consumption to meet
the energy demands are estimated on the basis of each
regions existing energy use patterns, the existing stock
of energy-using equipment, and the characteristics of
available new technologies, as well as new sources of
primary energy supply.
Period-by-period market simulations aim to provide
each regions energy services at minimum cost by simultaneously making end-use equipment and primary
energy supply decisions. For example, in SAGE, if there
is an increase in residential lighting energy service,
either existing generation equipment must be used more
intensively or new equipment must be installed. The
choice of generation equipment (type and fuel) incorporates analysis of both the characteristics of alternative
generation technologies and the economics of primary
energy supply.
Although the modeling system used to develop the projections has changed, this years IEO maintains the same
level of fuel detail and the same tabular format. As in the
past, the IEO provides projections of total world primary energy consumption, as well as projections of
energy consumption by primary energy type (oil,
natural gas, coal, nuclear, and hydroelectric and other
renewable resources) and projections of net electricity
consumption. Projections of carbon dioxide emissions
resulting from fossil fuel use are also provided. All projections are computed in 5-year intervals through the
year 2025. Further, more detailed tables that emphasize
the end-use demand-driven nature of SAGE will be considered for future reports.
SAGE projections are provided for regions and selected
countries. Projections are made for 14 individual
countries, 9 of whichUnited States, Canada, Mexico,
Japan, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and
Netherlandsare part of the designation industrialized countries. Individual country projections are also
made for China, India, South Korea, Turkey, and Brazil,
all of which are considered developing countries.
Beyond those individual countries, the rest of the world
is divided into regions. Industrialized regions include
North America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States),
Western Europe (United Kingdom, France, Germany,
Italy, Netherlands, and Other Europe), and Pacific
(Japan and Australia/New Zealand). Developing regions include developing Asia (China, India, South
Korea, and Other Asia), Middle East (Turkey and Other
Middle East), Africa, and Central and South America
(Brazil and Other Central and South America). The
transitional economies, consisting of the countries in
Eastern Europe (EE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU),
are considered as a separate country grouping, neither
industrialized nor developing.
Projections of world oil prices over the forecast horizon
are provided to SAGE from EIAs International Energy
Module, which is a submodule of the National Energy
Modeling System (NEMS). Projections of world nuclear
energy consumption are derived from nuclear power
electricity generation projections from EIAs International Nuclear Model (INM), PC Version (PC-INM). All
U.S. projections are taken from EIAs Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).
A full description of SAGE is forthcoming in a threevolume set. The first volume will provide a general
understanding of the models design, theoretical basis,
necessary user-defined assumptions, and output. It will
also list the software necessary to develop and analyze
the results of SAGE-based policy and energy market
scenarios and provide vendor contact information. The
second volume, a Reference Guide, will explain each
equation in detail, and a third volume will serve as a
Users Guide for those actively developing SAGE-based
scenario analyses. The documentation will be available
on EIAs web site in the summer of 2003. Also available
for downloading at that time will be the regional
assumptions used to develop the IEO2003 projections.
The format of the assumptions will follow the instructions appearing in the Users Guide.

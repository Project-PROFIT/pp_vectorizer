Introduction
The conference Ecotaxes in Germany and the UK  A Business View was organised by Green Budget
Germany in cooperation with the Heinrich-Bll-Foundation and the Anglo-German-Foundation. Its main focus
was to compare and contrast the ecological taxation systems in the UK and Germany and its underlying logic
in this context was to investigate why ecological taxation is communicated, perceived and received so differently in the two countries and to lay foundations for future research.
This introduction aims to provide the reader with a basic knowledge of the ecotax systems in the two countries and common arguments for and against their implementation, thus placing the later presentations in
context. It examines the main topics discussed at the conference, such as the issue of social insurance payments in Germany and the UK, possible improvements to both ecotax systems and the issue of European
harmonisation. Later contributions examine many of the issues touched upon here in more detail, as do the
conference discussions, which have also been included. Green Budget Germany would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the conference  participants, speakers and funding bodies. We are
looking forward to future cooperation and further developments as a result of the conferences conclusions.
As noted above, the very different responses on the part of business to ecotax in Germany and the UK provided Green Budget Germany with one source of inspiration for the conference. The Climate Change Levy 
although by no means welcomed with open arms  was comparatively well-received by industry, which is
particularly remarkable in the light of the fact that the levy targets industry and does not directly effect domestic energy users. In Germany on the other hand, the ecological tax reform received relatively bad press
and was negatively received by industry, which claimed that the ecotax threatened international competitiveness and would lead to job losses and relocations. Particularly notable in the case of Germany is that the
discourse of damnation has continued even though energy-intensive industries effectively pay only 3 percent
of the tax, by means of the so-called Spitzenausgleich1 and many other businesses pay only 60 percent, and
in spite of evidence that most industrial sectors actually profit from the tax2.
The sections below first investigate typical explanations for these very different receptions: the differing economic structures of the two countries and the importance of exports for the German economy. It is shown
that neither of these explanations can truly clarify this difference.
The paper goes on to compare the income from tax receipts in the two countries. This serves the dual purpose of contrasting the revenues raised by ecological taxation and highlighting the high cost of labour in
Germany largely resulting from high social insurance payments  an issue that was much discussed
throughout the conference, particularly with reference to the notion of the double dividend.
The next two sections examine the real differences in the rates of taxation. The analysis is separated into tax
on electricity and heating fuels, then on transport fuels. Particularly because the two systems in question are
extremely complex, this is by no means an easy task. The object of this section is to provide a relatively brief
and simple overview of the relevant similarities and differences between the German and British ecological
taxation systems, to put the presentations that follow in context.
The final section directly compares taxation rates on electricity and transport fuels and considers whether
these differences are ecologically and environmentally justifiable. This last section also highlights possible
potential for improvement to both ecotax structures in the future.
This compensation for energy-intensive industry effectively provides for a 97 percent reduction on the rate of ecological taxation.
Many sectors of the German economy have made significant savings as a result of the ecotax. The public services sector has made
savings of approx.  1.4 billion; manufacturing has saved  972 million and the service industries  727 million. For more details see Dr.
Anselm Grres' welcoming speech below.

Two Common Explanations for Two Different Ecotax Structures: the German and British Economies
As noted above, one of the most startling contrasts between the two ecological taxation systems is the sectors most deliberately targeted by the respective policies. In the UK, the Climate Change Levy is a downstream tax on energy, deliberately designed to avoid impacting domestic energy users for socio-economic
reasons.3 In contrast, the German ecotax was designed to avoid hitting business too hard, due to concerns
that a tax that deliberately targeted industry would jeopardise international competitiveness.
One of the most common explanations for the almost total exemption of energy intensive industry in Germany from the ecotax is the contrasting economic structures of the two countries. It is often argued that the
decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in the UK and the resulting shift towards the post-industrial society has rendered the UK less dependent on manufacturing and energy-intensive heavy industries than
Germany. The statistics do indeed support this argument to a limited extent: In the UK, almost 74 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) is generated by service industries, while in Germany services account for only
68 percent. However, as shown on the bar chart below, the economies of the two countries are not as dissimilar as is often claimed.

The dependency argument does not only draw on evidence from the sectoral structure of the German economy, however. Industry also argues that the unprecedented international focus of the German economy disqualifies any measures (e.g. ecological tax reform) that increase costs and result in increased prices, thus
jeopardising international competitiveness.
At first glance, this argument seems to have the facts on its side. Almost one-third of company profits are
generated through export; one in four jobs in Germany is dependent on foreign trade; and exports from Germany are worth more than twice as much as exports from the UK and are on a par with the total output of
Spain.4 However, what it fails to take into account is that the impact of higher costs on international competitiveness depends on the extent to which higher costs actually result in higher prices. Presuming that price increases are inevitable fails to take into account the flexibility of businesses to target prices to international
Fuel poverty for domestic energy users in the UK is a significant problem. The UK government estimates that 4 million people have difficulties heating their homes in winter.

markets in response to increasing electricity costs. For example, businesses are able to neutralise cost
changes by accepting lower profit margins, which might in turn lead to increased production.5
While the significance of international trade for the German economy should not be underestimated, the contributions of British speakers provided considerable evidence of the savings which even energy-intensive industries can make by implementing energy-saving and carbon abatement measures. For example, Sir
Charles Nicholson, Senior Policy Advisor at BP plc, announced in his presentation that BP made savings of
US $650 billion as a result of a BP-internal emissions trading scheme and other energy-saving measures. It
is extremely likely that the introduction of similar measures in a German company would result in comparable
savings, thus rendering German business more  rather than less  competitive.
Significantly, German speakers at the conference corroborated this view. Green Budget Germany Advisory
Board member and conference speaker Dr. Georg Riegel, founder and managing director of dezem GmbH,
pointed out that businesses can save far more by implementing energy saving measures than an ecological
tax would foreseeably levy, corroborating evidence from British speakers during the morning session. Dr.
Anselm Grres noted that many sectors in Germany have gained considerably as a result of the ecological
tax reform and have considerably lower tax bills as a result  manufacturing saves 972 million annually,
construction 246 million and energy and water supply 150 million.
Moreover, the concerns of industry with regard to international competitiveness issues have indeed been
taken into account in the ecological taxation structures of both countries. Energy-intensive industries in Germany and in the UK are entitled to effective exemptions of 97 and 80 percent respectively, in the UK in return
for emissions reduction commitments agreed in Climate Change Agreements negotiated with government6.
To summarise, the conference was unable to find evidence to support the suggestion that ecological taxation
levied on industry necessarily jeopardises international competitiveness and unduly heightens the risk of
business relocation. A recent study carried out by the German Institute for Economic Research, the University of Osnabrck and GWS, and the University of Oldenburg corroborates this conclusion. Using two macroeconomic models, the PANTA RHEI multi-sector econometric simulation and forecast model and the LEAN
simulation model, the study concluded that environmental fiscal reform in Germany can be expected to have
a minimal impact on economic growth while reducing CO2 emissions and increasing employment.7
Perhaps a more pressing issue in relation to distortive competitive effects is the different rates of taxation in
EU member states. In this regard, both the conference itself and the findings of the simulation study above
highlighted the importance of the introduction of suitable instruments for emissions abatement and minimum
levels of ecological taxation throughout the EU. This issue is examined in depth below.
Tax Structures in the UK and Germany
The two pie charts on the following page show the share of tax revenues in the UK and in Germany by
source. At their most basic level, these reveal that Germany raises a higher proportion of revenue from ecological taxation than the UK  indeed, as the pie chart shows, only the Fuel Duty Escalator in the UK raises a
significant amount of revenue at all8, while almost 10 percent of Germanys tax receipts come from ecotax in
one form or another.
One of the most significant differences between the two tax structures is the huge proportion of social insurance contributions payable in Germany, which accounts for almost 50 percent of all tax receipts, while national insurance accounts for just 20 percent in the UK. While this figure should be understood in context 
the National Health Service is funded by income tax as well as from national insurance  this structural fault
For more details of this argument see "The effects of environmental fiscal reform in Germany: a simulation Study", Stephan Bach, Michael Kohlhaas, Bernd Meyer, Barbara Praetorious, Heinz Welsch, Energy Policy 30 (2002) 803-811.
Energy intensive industries negotiated agreements with the UK government to reduce their emissions systematically in five steps every
two years from 2000 to 2010 and received an 80 percent reduction on the Climate Change Levy in return. It is of note in this context that
some sectors committed themselves to reducing their emissions by a considerable amount: for example, chemicals committed themselves to an 18 percent improvement to energy efficiency, cement to a 26 percent improvement, semi-conductors to a 59 percent improvement and aluminium to a 32 percent improvement.

is arguably one of the underlying reasons for the emphasis, particularly in Germany, on the so-called double
dividend  the implementation of ecological taxation to reduce labour costs while taxing environmentally
damaging behaviour. Whether using ecological tax revenues to reduce social insurance payments is still the
best way to use the revenues raised, or whether it acts to support an underlying structural fault which ought
to be more directly addressed, was discussed in some detail during the conference, particularly during the
panel discussion at the end of the day.
The UK Climate Change Levy and the German Ecotax on Electricity and Heating Fuels9
As noted above, ecological tax in the UK in the guise of the Climate Change Levy was a downstream energy
tax on business rather than domestic users, whereas the German ecotax targeted electricity and gas at point
of consumption by domestic and industrial energy users, although much of industry was partially exempt.
This renders a direct comparison of the two instruments relatively difficult, as taxes paid on the energy used
are paid on energy at different stages in the process of energy use and by different sectors.
On the other hand, the two systems do have many similarities and reflect the recommendations contained in
Lord Colin Marshalls ground-breaking report, Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy (HM
Treasury, 1998). Both tax systems aim to protect the competitive position of the economy, recycle revenues
to business by means of lowered employer national insurance contributions, take energy-intensive sectors
into consideration while retaining some form of incentive for energy saving (although there is certainly room
for improvement in both countries in this respect) and aim to increase incentives for the take-up of renewable
sources of energy.
For the purposes of analysis, only the German ecotax on electricity and heating fuels is discussed here,
while transport fuels are discussed later in a separate section, below. This enables a more direct comparison
of the two systems.
The graph below is based on figures collated by the European Commission in preparation for the implementation of the EU energy tax Directive 2003/96/EC and provides an overview of the overall taxation rates on
energy products in the two countries; however, these taxes are not by definition entirely ecological, i.e.
solely introduced as part of a systematic ecological fiscal reform policy, and do not differentiate between
commercial and domestic users.

The actual ecological tax on electricity used for commercial purposes amounts to 0.71 Euro cent per kilowatt
hour in the UK, whereby energy-intensive industries which negotiate Climate Change Agreements with the
UK government receive reductions of 80 percent to this rate  0.14 Euro cent per kilowatt hour  in return for
emissions reduction commitments. Ecological taxation on electricity in Germany amounts to 2.05 Euro cent,
although energy-intensive businesses receive an effective reduction of 97 percent  0.06 Euro cent per kilowatt hour  and forestry, agriculture and manufacturing receive reductions of 40 percent  which amounts to
an ecotax rate of 1.23 Euro cent. Not only is the amount of ecological taxation on natural gas for heating
much lower in the UK  0.23 Euro cent per kilowatt hour, in contrast to Germanys rate of 0.6 Euro cent  but
light fuel heating oil is exempt from the UK levy altogether as it already carries excise duty, while 2.05 Euro
cent per litre ecotax is paid on light fuel heating oil in Germany.

The differing rates of taxation in the two countries as shown above could be used to defend, to some degree
at least, tax reductions for industry from the German ecotax. As the Climate Change Levy on electricity constitutes approximately one third of the ecotax in Germany, it is possible to argue that the UK can afford to tax
industry more heavily, as such low tax rates are almost immaterial for business in any case. Moreover, falling
electricity prices in the UK due to continued liberalisation of the market have offset the impact of the 10-15
percent increases in electricity prices due to the Climate Change Levy to such a degree that businesses
have hardly felt the pinch of the levy at all. On the other hand, effective reductions for energy-intensive businesses in Germany are such that their rate of tax is still lower than that in the UK and they are not required to
negotiate emissions abatement agreements in return. To put this in context: the UK chemical industry pays
0.14 Euro cent per kilowatt hour ecotax on electricity and in return, agreed to reduce emissions by 18 percent, the UK aluminium industry pays the same low rate and committed themselves to reducing emissions by
32 percent in return. In Germany, both sectors are required to pay 0.06 Euro cent per kilowatt hour without
accompanying agreements.
The targeting of all electricity users in Germany, the lower rates of the Climate Change Levy, and the different sizes of the two countries economies have inevitably resulted in considerable differences in the amount
of revenue raised by the two energy tax systems. In 2003, revenues from the Climate Change Levy  paid by
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 9
industry alone  amounted to 1.3 billion, whereas the ecotax on electricity, gas and heating oil  paid by industrial and domestic users  raised 10.5 billion in total in Germany.10
In the UK, over 90 percent of all revenue raised through the Climate Change Levy is used to reduce employer's national insurance contributions (NIC) by 0.3 percent and to fund the Carbon Trust, which is responsible for developing programmes to assist business to improve its energy efficiency and for supporting the
development of new low-carbon technologies. Although reviews from the Federation of Small Businesses
and from the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation indicate that the
industrial sector as a whole pays more tax than it receives from the reduction in employer's national insurance contributions, these figures do not take account of the revenue recycled to provide support for energy
efficiency.11
In Germany, approximately 60 percent of the 10.5 billion paid in ecotax on electricity, gas and heating oil is
paid by domestic energy users12, meaning that approximately 4.2 billion was paid by industry. 88 percent of
revenues from ecotax paid on electricity, gas and heating oil (and indeed 88 percent of all ecotax revenues)
are recycled into the German pensions payment system and half of this, i.e. 4.6 billion, is used to reduce
employer's pension contributions. Thus, German industry as a whole is a net winner from the ecotax on electricity, gas and heating oil and profits by 0.4 billion.
While the purpose of an ecological tax might ultimately be that of a steering mechanism, i.e. its primary function might not be to raise a great deal of revenue but to change behaviour, the amount of revenue raised in
the UK  one eighth of that in Germany  seems to be too low to incentivise the introduction of energysavings measures. This is particularly important because, as the conference presentations show, the potential for energy saving measures in business is tremendous in both countries and seldom used to its full advantage.
In terms of carbon emissions, it seems unlikely that the UK Levy itself incentivised emissions reduction sufficiently, particularly as tax increases were offset by falling electricity prices. This speaks in favour of a direct
tax on carbon emissions, as called for by business according to a survey carried out by the Green Alliance in
2002.13 In spite of this, the Climate Change Agreements introduced in April 2001 with the Levy were able to
save 13.5 million tonnes of carbon in their first year. In Germany, estimates vary greatly in relation to emissions reductions. The German government estimated in its climate protection program 2000 that the ecological tax reform will save 10 million tonnes of CO2 in 2005 in relation to 1998 emissions levels and that 6-8 million tonnes of these CO2 savings will be achieved in the transport sector, while other studies indicate reductions of between 9 and 24 million tonnes relative to 1998 by 2003.14 From the German governments figures it
would seem that Climate Change Agreements are the more effective instrument in terms of emissions
abatement, while other, more optimistic estimates of the impact of the ecotax in Germany would seem to indicate the opposite. Thus, it is difficult to make a definite statement in this regard.
The total revenue raised by the ecotax in Germany amounted to 18.6 billion. This can be broken down as follows: 0.2 billion ecotax
revenue from tax on heating oil, 3.4 billion from tax on natural gas, 6.5 billion from tax on electricity, 2.4 billion from tax on petrol and
5.7 billion from tax on diesel. The latter two figures are not included in the 10.5 billion quoted above, as ecotax on transport fuels are
dealt with in a separate section, below.

Fuel Duty in the UK and the German Ecotax on Fuels
It is possible to make a relatively uncomplicated and direct comparison of fuel taxation in Germany and the
UK. The actual rates of duty in the UK and Germany in cent per litre of fuel are shown in the diagram below.

The most obvious point in this context is that the UK has the same rate of taxation on petrol and diesel,
unlike other EU member states. Bringing the rate of diesel taxation into line with that of petrol in Germany is
the first point in Green Budget Germanys thirteen-point program for the further development of ecologicalsocial tax reform in Germany, the FS/GBG Memorandum 2004, and the Fuel Duty Escalator is an example
of a successful policy instrument introduced to achieve this end.16
Secondly, the UK has the highest taxation rates of any EU member state on petrol and diesel  and can afford these high rates largely because it is an island and enjoys a more trapped market than other EU countries.17 Germany inevitably faces rather more direct competition in this regard, as its immediate neighbours 
all nine of them (the highest number in the world)  all have considerably lower rates of fuel taxation. For instance, prior to the implementation of the EU energy tax Directive 2003/96/EC in 2003, taxation in Germany
per 1,000 litres of fuel amounted to 625 for unleaded petrol and 441 for diesel, whereas Luxembourgs
rates amounted to a mere 372 and 253 and Austrias 407 and 282 respectively. Although these rates
Kerosene is almost exempt from fuel taxation in the UK and totally exempt in Germany. This may change in the future, as the EU energy tax Directive 2003/96/EC has given EU member states the possibility to tax kerosene used for internal flights and on flights between member states.

Nevertheless, as highlighted in the presentation by Liberal Democrat Shadow Environment Minister Sue Doughty MP, the UK freight
industry does suffer from competition distortions as a result of high fuel prices in the UK, as HGVs from foreign firms travel to the UK
with a full tank of fuel purchased more cheaply elsewhere. This problem will be rectified to some degree in 2006, when the UK plans to
introduce HGV tolls and lower the tax on commercial diesel use, bringing it more into line with the rest of the EU.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View

have been or will have to be increased in line with the new EU energy tax directive18, these increases will
have little practical impact in terms of fuel tourism in Germany  as explained in the next paragraph.
The new energy tax Directive stipulates minimum taxation rates for diesel of 302 per 1,000 litres of diesel
from 2003 and 330 per 1,000 litres of diesel by 2010, but diesel was already taxed at a rate of 710 per
1,000 litres in the UK and 470 per 1,000 litres in Germany in 2003. Thus, in spite of minimal increases elsewhere in the EU, it will still pay for German car drivers living near a border with e.g. Austria, Luxembourg, or
the Czech Republic, to purchase their fuel abroad, or for hauliers travelling to the UK to fill up their fuel tanks
before crossing the channel. German hauliers in particular have made tank tourism a matter of company
policy. Thus, such low minimum taxation rates can do little to resolve the problem of fuel tourism in the EU in
countries with particularly high ecological taxation on vehicle fuels, such as Germany or the UK. This
highlights the importance of EU-wide legislation stipulating minimum taxation rates on transport fuels that are
considerably higher than the lowest common denominator.
In terms of revenues raised from transport fuel duty, Germany is slightly ahead and raised 38.8 billion in
2003, while the UK raised 36.7 billion in the 2002-3 financial year. However, this statistic does not reflect
the fact that the UK has 424 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants and 60 million inhabitants in total, while Germany
has 541 vehicles per 1,000 and 82.5 million inhabitants overall. Thus, while the annual average fuel duty
paid per vehicle in Germany amounts to 869.96, this figure amounts to 1444.88 in the UK.19 Bearing in
mind transport's significant and growing contribution to CO2 emissions, both countries should incentivise
public transport use and alternative fuels to a greater extent and continue to raise fuel duty, although the latter would be considerably easier to implement in the context of EU-wide harmonisation. On a more positive
note, the impact of the ecological tax reform in Germany is already evident  since its introduction, transport
fuel consumption has decreased by approximately 9 percent and public transport use has increased by approximately 4 percent. In the UK, in spite of its having a grievously underfunded public transport system, bus
use increased by 5 percent in the same period.
Emissions Sources and Ecotax Rates
The ecological tax structures of both countries levy higher rates of taxation on vehicle fuel energy than on
energy from electricity. Assuming that a passenger car using unleaded petrol consumes 8 litres of petrol per
100 kilometres, the rate of taxation per kilowatt hour on unleaded, sulphur-free petrol in the UK is 7.1 Euro
cent, while the full rate of ecological tax on electricity amounts to just 0.71 Euro cent per kilowatt hour. In
Germany, the difference is less, but considerable nevertheless, amounting to 6.6 and 2.05 Euro cent per
kilowatt hour respectively.
This differentiation in the rate of taxation may be justified by a number of factors: the generally high price of
motor fuels reflects the cost of constructing and maintaining traffic infrastructure; traffic causes other important environmental and non-environmental externalities such as noise, emissions, traffic casualties, etc. far
more than other systems of energy use  indeed, research suggests that the external costs of transport typically amount to almost 10 percent of GDP, and 90 percent of these externalities are attributable to road
transport20; many people do have a viable alternative to the consumption of motor fuels in the form of other
means of transport; and finally, the growing share of CO2 emissions deriving from road transport in the EU.
Transport is the second-largest contributor to CO2 emissions after energy industries  and almost 97 percent
of this derives from vehicles. Between 1990 and 2002, CO2 emissions from transport increased by 23% and
in 2002, transport emissions accounted for 19 percent of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions  a proportion predicted to increase to 35% by 2010.21 It may be that high rates of taxation may have played a part
in keeping increases in CO2 transport emissions in the UK and Germany below the EU average of 18.4 percent22.
The directive stipulates that diesel taxation per 1,000 litres fuel must amount to 302 in 2003 and 330 in 2010. Luxembourg complied
with the directive in 2003 and increased diesel taxation accordingly, while Austria, along with Belgium and Spain, has special status in
this regard and is not required to raise diesel taxation to 302 per 1,000 litres until 2007 and to 330 in 2012.
Due to lack of reliable information, these calculations do not take through traffic or tank tourism  both phenomena that are almost
certainly more prevalent in Germany  into account.

Predictions differ depending on whether the ACEA agreement is implemented; if so, transport CO2 emissions are expected to make
up 25% of the EUs total CO2 emissions, if not, transport is predicted to make up as much as 35%. Transport emissions statistics accessed at www.eea.eu.int on 04.08.2004.

Nevertheless, the relatively limited impact of the high rates of taxation in the two countries reveals that the
minimum taxation rates stipulated by the EU energy tax Directive are in all probability too low to have a real
impact on this trend  indeed, these price increases are much lower than the rate of inflation. Furthermore,
transport fuel prices have actually fallen in terms of income-corrected figures, taking manifold higher incomes
in comparison to the previous decade. For this reason, the UK Fuel Duty Escalator is in addition to inflation 
a policy measure which conference participants noted merits serious consideration in the German context,
as inflation is not taken into account in the German ecotax system, which results in tax rates losing value and
thus their incentive function over time.
On a more positive note, new legislation currently being drafted on passenger car emissions, as discussed
by Christos Liolios from the European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union in his presentation (below), may well supplement the energy tax Directive in the near future.
Conclusion
Some aspects of energy saving in relation to electricity and heating fuels have not been sufficiently incentivised in either country. In Germany, for example, while domestic users and those industrial sectors not qualifying for exemptions have certainly felt the pinch of the ecotax, significant sectors of German industry have
enjoyed very much reduced rates. In the UK, both commercial and domestic energy users have profited from
falling electricity prices and have felt little incentive to save energy. While fuel poverty remains an issue in the
UK, the increased cost of heating as a result of an ecological tax on domestic energy use could be offset by
reductions or exemptions for less affluent consumers, or, better still, by the provision of grants for home insulation. What is more, several of the presentations below reveal a great deal of potential for energy saving in
business. Many of these methods are equally applicable to household use.
The conference revealed that one of the most fundamental stages in the process of implementing ecological
fiscal reform is succeeded in putting an initial instrument in place. Once an instrument exists, it may be adjusted to target particular emissions sources, to raise more or less revenue, or extended to cover other fuels.
In short, it can be finely tuned. Thus, while some elements of this introduction may seem critical of ecological
taxation in Germany and the UK, now that these systems exist, they can be developed and improved  for
example, as set out in Green Budget Germanys Memorandum for 2004.23

I would like to welcome all conference participants to the
Heinrich-Bll-Foundation. I am here to represent Barbara
Unmig, one of our executive board members, who is not able
to be here today due to an unexpected illness.
On behalf of the Heinrich-Bll-Foundation, I would like to say how
delighted we are that this event is actually taking place. The topic
is more important than ever before. If we do not take action,
climate change will be unstoppable. To quote Sir David King, the
UK Chief Scientific Adviser: There is no bigger problem than climate change. The threat is quite simple, it is a threat to our
civilisation.
The ecological tax reform is one of the central instruments which
offers a constructive solution not only to climate change, but also
to other environmental problems. For this reason, it is so important to work with two countries  Britain and Germany  that are
forerunners in the field of ecotaxes; to collaborate, exchange best
practice and learn from one another, and to promote the ecological tax reform with the support of as many interested parties as
possible.
I am particularly pleased to see that this conference is examining the business perspective, as it is very important to get companies on board  their business perspectives are influenced by the design of ecotaxes,
and they are after all very influential actors. Ecotaxes affect almost everybody, and they all too easily fall
prey to populist campaigns, as we have had to learn in Germany.
I would particularly like to thank our partners who arranged this conference and everyone who has come
here today. Interestingly, one of the first projects of the newly created Heinrich-Bll-Foundation, the result of
a merger of three foundations in 1997, was to support a campaign for the ecological tax reform by an umbrella organisation of German Environment NGOs. So we are of course very happy to continue this tradition
with this conference.
For all these reasons, we are looking forward to an interesting discussion. I hope you enjoy your time here at
the foundation and hope that we go home with a great deal more knowledge at the end of the day.

R AY CUNNINGH AM, ANGLO-GERM AN FOUNDATION, WELCOMING SPEECH
Ladies and gentlemen, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, good morning, my name is Ray Cunningham and
Im the deputy director of the Anglo-German Foundation and its representative in Germany. Its a great
pleasure to welcome you here today on behalf of the Foundation. Its full name is the Anglo-German Foundation for the study of industrial society or die Deutsch-Britische-Stiftung fr das Studium der Industriegesellschaft.
The foundations purpose is to support comparative and collaborative research and policy exchange on social and economic issues affecting both Great Britain and Germany. We are currently concentrating our activities on four priority areas: migration and the labour market, the ageing society, healthcare systems and
work-life balance. But by means of a
small grants programme, we also
continue to address a wider range of
important issues relevant to both
countries and to the development of
industrial society. (Under the term industrial society we mean not so much
the narrower German understanding of
manufacturing but the whole process of
wealth generation in modern societies.)
One of the most important of the areas
addressed in our wider programme
since the inception of the foundation
has been environmental policy, and
todays event provides some evidence
that our activities do indeed bear fruit, if
sometimes fairly slowly.
Ray Cunningham (right) and Stephen Smith
In 1995, Stephen Smith  our speaker today from the UK research community  completed a comparative
study on the prospects for ecotaxes in Britain and Germany. The study was called, Greening the Tax System in Britain and Germany: and obviously, someone in both governments  or more accurately perhaps, in
both oppositions at the time  was paying attention. Now that both governments have introduced ecotaxes of
a kind analysed by Stephen in this report, the next logical step is to optimise those taxes in terms of both
their environmental and their fiscal impact. This demands logically as well that we ensure they do not place a
disproportionate handicap on national industries or on particular sectors as that would weaken their overall
impact. That is the purpose of todays event as I see it  to help to optimise ecological taxation in both countries. Although I assume that Stephen has updated his research for the presentation he is giving today, his
report remains, at the theoretical level, relevant and well worth reading, and I commend it to you. But I commend even more heartily the presentations and discussion you are about to hear.
Finally, I would like to thank Kai Schlegelmilch and his colleagues for their initiative and hard work in putting
this event together. Thank you.

Our organisation can be very proud of this conference. Given that Green Budget Germany24 only has about
150 members, an attendance of about 70 or 80 conference guests is extremely impressive. This is also an
achievement in relation to other ecotax conferences  we have seen many ecotax conferences throughout
Europe over the last few years and there have not been many that have had such a great number of people
attending. We have guests here from about a dozen different countries, from Austria, from Estonia, from
Greece, from Ireland, from Portugal and Spain, from Sweden and Switzerland, from the UK, the United
States and even a representative from the United Nations.
There are numerous companies represented
here, from BP to Volkswagen, and also a
number of people who represent industrial
associations or federations. Government
organisations are also represented, ministries
from countries such as Hungary, Sweden and
the Czech Republic, representatives from
German institutions, German ministries and
German regional governments, even some
embassies are represented. There are people
from the scientific community, from the London
School of Economics to the Technical
University of Tallinn. Finally, we have a
number of people here from NGOs, ecological
institutions and consulting firms.
As Chairman of Green Budget Germany, I am
obliged to include some commercials for our
organisation during the course of the day. This
is the first.
Anselm Grres (left) and Charles Nicholson
This year and this day have a very special meaning for our organisation. The year 2004 is the fifth birthday of
the German ecological tax reform  we celebrated this event in the Munich city hall with Munich's mayor,
Christian Ude. As well, 2004 is the tenth anniversary of the foundation of our organisation. And today is very
important for our organisation, because we moved our annual general meeting and advisory board meeting
to June (it usually takes place in March) in honour of this conference.
I particularly have to thank the Anglo-German-Foundation  especially you, Ray Cunningham  for their
friendly support and their patience. Kai Schlegelmilch and Ray Cunningham have been working on this conference project for more than two years. Sometimes it seemed almost impossible  but we finally did it. Furthermore, this is not the first time and it will not be the last that we have to thank the Heinrich-Bll-Foundation
for their hospitality. I should also mention a representative of the small team we have in the Green Budget
Germany office in Munich, Jacqueline Cottrell. Jacqueline has run the preparation of this conference like a
professional and I would like to thank her and all our other interns  our interns are all volunteers, they work
in our office, prepare our newsletter and even organise conferences like professional event managers.
The debate on ecological tax reform began in Germany in the early 1990s. One of the main concerns was
the potential loss of competitiveness. The general response was that people agreed in principle that ecological tax reform was a good idea, but argued that it would risk the total loss of Germany's competitive position
on international markets. Perhaps this argument carries even more weight in Germany than the UK, because
a higher proportion of Germany's gross national product is derived from industrial production. The counterargument to ecological tax reform was always that it would damage German industry.

But our impression is, and this will be the topic of today, that the reaction in the UK has been less anxious
and less hostile. In Germany, opposition sometimes reached degrees of anxiety and hostility which made life
very difficult for us, yet when we look at the figures, despite all these fears and dire prophecies, German
industry is a net winner from ecological taxation  as shown on the graph below.

Unfortunately, although we begged the BDI  the German Industry Association  to send a representative
today, they declined. We do not consider it necessary that everyone speaking at and attending the conference agrees with our views  but we are interested in open and fair debate. We will go on inviting the BDI,
however, in the hope that someone from the BDI will one day be prepared to discuss with us. It must be possible for discussions to take place between those who fight for the environment and those who represent
German industry.
Another reason for these different public discussions in the UK and Germany seems to have been the difference in the relative weighting of the ecotax burden borne on the one hand by industry and on the other by
private consumers and households. In Germany, partly because of our different competitive position, there
have been considerable reductions to the rates paid by industry. At first, industry had to pay only 20 percent
of the normal rate, but now, they have to pay 60 percent  which is still a 40 percent reduction. In Germany,
industry pays proportionally less than other consumers, whereas in the UK, this situation is reversed. We hope today to be able to discuss how we can increase the burdens on German industry without jeopardising its
competitiveness.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Sir Charles Nicholson, senior policy adviser for British Petroleum, BP. Although the Brent Spar incident was not BP but Shell, it shows that sometimes a mishap in one
organisation can influence what happens within other organisations. However, I understand that BP began to
develop a climate change policy long before the Brent Spar incident itself. Within BP, there have been discussions of how the company can stand for not only British Petroleum but Beyond Petroleum  and there are
many examples of this. There has been an internal emissions units trading scheme at BP for quite some time
 a fine example of very impressive corporate policy  and BP is also active in the field of photovoltaic solar
cells. BP is for us an example of how industry ought to react  as we cannot deny the ecological challenge, it
is our duty to react to it in a constructive way and not simply to ignore it.
I hope you all enjoy the conference and its discussions very much. Thank-you all very much for coming today.

UNION,
T H E P E R S P E C T I V E S O F A P P L Y I N G E C O T A X E S I N T H E EU
This conference is extremely interesting, even for what are often
called bureaucrats at the EU  we need a fresh input directly, from
business, from those who are on the spot.
Please note that this presentation represents my own views and not
those of the Commission.
Environmental taxes  Background Information
I will begin by addressing the issue of taxation at its most basic level.
For many years, taxation was a method of raising revenue for the
budget. This changed after the Rio conference in 1992, when people
discovered that taxation can have functions other than simple
revenue raising. This is a very important issue in EU member states,
and for Green Budget Germany  raising money for the budget.
Taxation is considered to be an aspect of national sovereignty and
because of its importance, each member state wishes to retain
decision-making on taxation within its own national parliament. Thus,
the EC Treaty Article 93 provides that tax legislation requires
unanimity at the Council. This is very important, because it means
that every decision that is made at community level has to be agreed
unanimously. The main driving force behind taxation today is to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal
market and to promote sustainability and sustainable development. This sustainability has three aspects; social, economic and environmental.
The first elements of harmonisation at Community level were introduced in 1992 in Directive 92/81/EEC on
mineral oils. Although this Directive did not cover natural gas, coal or energy directly, but only oils, it still covered about 45 percent of all energy products. This Directive allowed member states to adopt national laws
and apply taxes on energy products and was valid until 31st December 2003. It harmonised the tax bases but
not tax levels. It introduced some minimal levels of taxation to apply throughout the Community, but member
states were allowed to introduce much higher levels at their discretion. For instance, the minimum level of
taxation for diesel was 245 per 1,000 litres, but the UK applies approximately 708 tax per 1,000 litres,
while Greece and Luxembourg apply more or less the minimum.
During this time it became clear that taxation did have a strong incentive value. A good example was the
case of leaded and unleaded petrol. When fiscal benefits for unleaded petrol were introduced, leaded petrol
disappeared. Taxation and tax differentiation proved to be very efficient tools for the promotion of fiscal and
other Community policies, as they have such a strong incentive value. For this reason, people increasingly
came to consider taxation for other transformational objectives, particularly in relation to environmental policy.
Instruments used to promote Environmental Policy
Technical regulations rather than fiscal incentives have traditionally been applied in this area. After the 1992
Rio conference, employing market-based instruments (MBIs) to promote environmental objectives came increasingly under consideration. The term MBI covers a wide range of instruments  environmental taxes;
greenhouse gas emissions trading allowances; voluntary agreements, such as those made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometre; subsidies; green certificates; and many
other incentives.
European Community initiatives after the 1992 Rio conference were very ambitious at first. In 1992 a proposal was put forward for a harmonised environmental tax on carbon dioxide throughout the EU. This tax
was to be based 50 percent on emissions, 50 percent on the energy content of products. It failed as a result
of the unanimity rule and after four years of negotiations, it was abandoned in 1996.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 18
Following this, a new Proposal on taxation of energy products was presented in 1997, which later became
Directive 2003/96/EC in 2003 after six years of negotiations. I will return to this Directive later.
Attempts were also made to harmonise and enhance the communication of ecological taxation. In 1997, the
Commission published the Communication on Ecological Tax and Charges in the Single Market (COM(97)9),
which contains guidelines for member states on how ecological taxation can be introduced while still respecting Community rules on competitiveness within the internal market, Community definitions of state aid and
the Communitys legal framework related to the functioning of the single market.
Directive 2003/96/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity
I will now turn to Directive 2003/96/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, which entered into
force on 1st January 2003. At the Commission, we are currently investigating how best to apply it, as it is a
very difficult and complex Directive. It includes many new aspects of ecological taxation.
First of all, all energy resources are covered  with the exception of peat  rather than just 45 percent of
them. The minimum taxation rates for mineral oils  stable since 1992 and not subject to inflation  have
been increased and new positive minimum rates have been introduced for electricity, gas and coal. There
are only few compulsory exemptions: aviation fuel; maritime fuels; fuels used for the production of electricity.
However, aviation is slightly more differentiated  member states may tax domestic flights and potentially intra-Community flights as well. There are also many optional tax differentiations, to promote alternative energies and renewables, like bio-fuels for instance, and there are provisions for energy-intensive industries and
household consumption. There are other possibilities for further tax differentiation, something which we refer
to as Article 8(4) derogations  a member state can gain authorisation from the Commission to tax below
the minimum rate of taxation, but this is very much the exception and not the rule, as it was in the previous
Directive. The Directive has also introduced specific rules for electricity, natural gas and coal.
This new Directive offers member states a great deal of flexibility. Once they respect the minimum, they can
differentiate rates of taxation for quality reasons, for quantity reasons, for business and non-business use.
There are also specific rules for electricity, in cases where electricity is produced from renewable energy
sources. This Directive has made a great deal of progress in relation to the previous one.
Competitiveness Issues in Directive 2003/96/EC
Turning to competitive issues in industry; this taxation differentiates considerably between business and nonbusiness. Normally, business pays less. There are normally two minimum rates of taxation on electricity from
national gas and goal. One for business use, which is lower, one for household consumption, which is
higher. Businesses that produce products such as chemicals or metals that require a great deal of energy
are excluded from the Directive. Whether these industries are taxed or not is left to the discretion of member
states. Article 17 of the Directive defines so-called, Energy Intensive Companies (EICs): in brief, businesses where purchases of energy products and electricity amounts to at least 3 percent of the production
value, or where national energy tax payable amounts to at least 0.5 percent of the added value. These industries can enter into additional voluntary agreements with their governments and will pay zero rates of
taxation on the energy they use as a result. Non-Energy Intensive Companies have a similar opportunity to
enter into voluntary agreements and obtain reductions, but are still required to pay 50 percent of the normal
taxation rate.
Directive 2003/87/EC, which was introduced in 2003, established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. It is possible that there will be a degree of overlap between Directive 2003/87/EC and the
energy taxation Directive 2003/96/EC  this issue is currently being examined by the European Commission,
which might publish a Communication soon identifying potential problems with the smooth functioning of the
Directive when it becomes obligatory in 2007. This Energy Directive might potentially require some degree of
adaptation as a result.
Perspectives for further Community action
Any perspectives for further Community action must take the unanimity rule in Council into account. Certainly, the sixth Environmental Action Programme, adopted in 2002, recommends the use of the most effective MBIs to achieve the Community's environmental objectives. All possibilities provided for under Directive
2003/96/EC (for tax differentiation, use of renewable energy sources, etc), should be explored and applied in
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 19
an optimal manner by the member states themselves. In 1997, it was estimated that 20 percent of the Kyoto
target could be achieved by optimally applying this Directive.
The Commission  and myself  is also currently working on a new proposal for Community legislation in areas having a serious environmental impact and particularly that of passenger cars (we anticipate drawing up
a new proposal by end of 2004). This is important, because passenger cars are responsible for most of the
pollution created by the transport sector  approximately 25 percent comes from HGVs, the remainder from
buses and passenger cars.
Furthermore, it is important to increase legal certainty particularly concerning the consistency between tax
measures, state aid rules and emissions trading, by applying the 2001 Community rules on state aid for environmental protection, and perhaps by amending the Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission published some
guidelines on state aid rules in 2001 to distinguish which aspects of so-called state aid cannot be considered
state aid. For instance, the Energy Tax Directive provides for some reductions in taxation for some business
and some kinds of energy that could be considered state aid. These guidelines are very detailed and may
well be renewed in 2007. Finally, the Commission plans in the long term to propose legislation aiming at enhancing the consistency between the Emission Trading Directive and the Energy Tax Directive.

SESSION 1, THE INTERNATION AL PERSPECTIVE, DISCUSSION
Jan F. Wagner, Correspondent for Environment Daily: When you talk about the Directive 2003/96, are
you suggesting that was the first step towards the harmonisation of energy taxes in the European Union?
Christos Liolios, European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union: I said the first step towards
some sort of harmonisation was Directive 81 of 1992, which was valid until 31st December last year.
Jan F. Wagner: But the 2003/96/EC Directive you spoke of  would you argue that it is the first step toward
EU harmonisation of energy taxes?
Christos Liolios: When the European Union talks about tax harmonisation, we mean we want the same tax
base, but not the same tax levels  we do not talk about harmonisation of tax levels, we try to harmonise tax
bases. We do not intend at all to have tax harmonisation. The 1992 carbon dioxide Proposal was a harmonisation proposal, but it failed in 1996, as I said earlier.
Jan F. Wagner: The other question is, of course, now that we have the Emissions Trading Scheme, there
are a lot of people saying that ecotaxes have become redundant, that we do not need them because we
have a mechanism to reduce CO2 emissions that works better and is market-based. How does the EU
Commission respond to that?
Christos Liolios: The Community very recently introduced new legislation which will become obligatory in
2005-2007  at present, everything is very experimental. Now the Commission is preparing to apply this system and trying to make it function. We are now preparing a Communication to investigate whether there is
some overlap, or extra burdens on industry, as a result of these two instruments. If this were the case, the
Commission would be prepared to amend this Directive, but we at a very early stage in this process and we
do not yet have any results  so it would be premature to say that this would result in increasing charges. We
are most certainly trying to avoid overlaps by working in cooperation with the Directorate General for the Environment.
Raivo Vilu, Tallinn Technical University: You described the instruments the Commission is recommending
to use, but you did not mention targets, deriving from Kyoto or elsewhere. If we do not define our targets,
then it is very difficult to assess the effectiveness of instruments.
Christos Liolios: It is true that we need targets on the environment. The main target is Kyoto  which stipulates 8 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than in 1990. These reductions have been allocated to the
member states, and each member state has different targets. As I said earlier, a 1997 European Commission study showed that the optimal application of the Directive could contribute 20 percent to the Kyoto target. We also have a new initiative on a taxation proposal for passenger cars, which we hope will also contribute to achieving our Kyoto targets.
The Commission also sets targets for its sustainable development strategy and we use these targets for our
environmental goals. There are many programs running within the Community and the Directorate General
for the Environment, one of the biggest departments of the Commission. Ecotaxes normally function within
the Kyoto target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions but we also have sustainability targets, for example,
the Lisbon target to create within the Community one of the most competitive economies in the world by
2010. We will see the results of Kyoto during the period from 2008 to 2012. There are some strategic objectives within the context of which fiscal measures such as the market-based instrument ecotax is functioning.
Peter Menke-Glckert, Chairman, Forum for Sustainable Medium-Sized Enterprises: You told us that
you are aiming to harmonise the tax bases. Have you ever considered including the harmonisation of tax
bases for the value-added tax system within this target? One of the consumption taxes that has a huge impact on the environment is the value-added tax system. In this respect, I wonder if you will be able to achieve
your targets without taking other tax instruments you have at your disposal into account?
Secondly, I fully agree that the ecotax system will become more and more redundant as many new instruments come into force  not only emissions trading. What will be your response to create a stable tax basis
in the common market  will it be an integrated system or will it be a tunnel system, just looking at one of the
targets rather than looking at the interrelated problems?
Jakob Klok, Swedish Ministry of Finance: You briefly mentioned the relationship between state aid guidelines and the energy tax Directive, and the forthcoming revision of the state aid guidelines. I find that very interesting, because it seems today that there are two parallel systems in operation  the new Directive on the
one hand and the system of court decisions and Commission decisions within the state aid area on the other.
For this reason, I would like to ask if the Commission has any idea of to what extent the new guidelines will
reflect the structure established in the energy tax Directive.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 21
Bernd Strobel, European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change: Why doesnt the current Directive include the transport sector? You mentioned the new proposal, but this is only targeted at passenger cars. But
freight transport remains immune  although its emissions are predicted to increase by 80 percent relative to
1990 levels. I believe that the main issue for the Commission is to push a Directive into force that targets this
emission source.
Christos Liolios: Taxation and its development are not simple issues. No-one can find simple replies, noone can find replies that satisfy anybody. When we focus on tax differentiation, in the area of passenger cars
for instance, some will have to pay more than they pay now, others will have to pay less, because they drive
more environmentally friendly vehicles. This means that introducing taxation  as you always ask somebody
to pay more  is not an easy task, as everyone is very much interested in his or her own particular case. So it
is almost impossible to find solutions which satisfy everyone, that protect the environment, and that dont increase the fiscal revenue.
I would like to first turn to the issue of VAT. I am not involved in value added tax  a different department
deals with it. I take it on board that VAT can also be used to promote sustainability and to some extent, differentiated VAT rates do exist. However, to what extent they exist; whether studies have been carried out on
this issue; and whether the Commission is about to make proposals on this, are all questions on which I reserve my position to avoid giving you incorrect information. I will make a note of the question  whether and
to what extent VAT can be used to achieve environmental goals, while providing stable legislation and not
surprising anybody unduly  and discuss its potential at the Commission. I will keep Green Budget Germany
informed of any developments as regards procedures to make VAT greener and promote sustainability.
As regards the question from Jakob Klok, about state aid and the environment. In its very early stages, the
1997 proposal which became the new Directive faced enormous opposition from some member states, who
claimed that there was no legal clarity regarding how states had the right to apply exemptions or provide for
tax reforms. But now you can apply Articles 87-88 of the EC Treaty25, send us to the European Court, or impose penalties on us by means of state aid.
The Commission studied this issue for years in collaboration with member states in Brussels, and then they
published the 2001 guidelines on environmental protection. This contains a more detailed list than the earlier
guidelines  there have been guidelines in this field since 1974. The new guidelines are very clear and simple, contain clear examples what can  and cannot  be considered state aid, they specify the so-called diminimis amount that is not considered state aid. So far, this seems to have worked well, although the Commission has in the past accused states of giving tax reductions that are considered state aid.
Furthermore, one can argue that the Directive is relatively new  it only came into force on 1st January 2003
and for this reason, the Commission is ready to revise the guidelines in 2007 and they presume that this
process will be commenced before this date. The Swedish Ministry of Finance and other member state finance ministries will certainly collaborate in this process and your experience from the application of the Directive will certainly be taken into account. I know that this is a very difficult issue, which is also dealt with in
the Commission by the Directorate General for Competition  but so far, I think the situation is not particularly
dramatic and the rules are applied sufficiently well. There are certainly particular cases which I feel should be
taken into account during revision in 2007.
Now, moving on to the third question. I feel far better qualified to answer this, because I am personally responsible for drawing up the proposal for the taxation of passenger vehicles. Heavy goods vehicles are not
included in this proposal because they are taxed on the basis of other criteria, particularly on their use of infrastructure. Taxation is based on the idea is that heavy goods vehicles have to pay the infrastructure damage they cause  they are taxed in relation to how heavy they are, how many axels they have, how long they
are, and so on. The Community has been examining this so-called infrastructure charge for some time now.
As for passenger vehicles  and they are in the majority and pollute more  we are basing our proposal on
the Commissions 1996 strategy for how to reduce passenger vehicle emissions. While HGVs pay an infrastructure charge, no legislation exists for passenger vehicles. This proposal is the first attempt to introduce
measures in this regard and the Commission hopes to have a proposal by the end of this year.

Over 1993-2000 FDE raised fuel prices in real terms by 17p /litre (petrol) and 21p /litre (diesel).
FDE fuel price rise equivalent to carbon tax of $405 /tonneC (petrol) and $440 /tonneC (diesel).
How do these taxes compare to a systematic carbon tax?
An ideal carbon tax would:
Tax fuels in proportion to their carbon content
Apply uniformly to all sectors (industry, households, etc.)
Have no exemptions for energy-intensive sectors
Exempt non-fuel uses
Tax fuel inputs to electricity generation
Tax carbon at a rate equal to marginal damage costs of CO2 emissions
Be levied worldwide at the same rate
The optimal carbon tax rate
Most studies estimate the marginal damage costs of current carbon dioxide emissions at
$5-20 /tonne C
Some are much higher, over $100 /tonne C
Uncertainties are mainly downside risks (nasty surprises)
UK government uses 70 (approx $105) / tonne C for policy assessment

What role for taxes in future climate change policy?
EU Emissions Trading scheme will provide systematic market-based approach to climate change policy. Is
there still a need for energy taxes?
There is a strong case for taxes within climate change policy package, for three reasons:
Permits tend to be issued free, which foregoes revenues, and hence potential double dividend benefits
Taxes provide a safety net, reducing risk of overgenerous hot air permit allocation
Future international agreements should discuss carbon prices, and not just quantity targets. Coordinated carbon taxes would be a simpler agreement to define, implement and monitor.

Introduction
The commitments to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that the EU and some
other developed countries have entered into as a result of the Kyoto Protocol process are substantial. For
the EU countries as a whole, a reduction in emissions of 8 per cent is required by 2008-2012, as measured
against a baseline of the 1990 emissions level. Achieving emissions reductions on this scale will require significant policy effort, and will entail significant economic cost. Nevertheless, the impact on global emissions
will still be modest, because many large and/or rapidly-growing sources of emissions lie outside the agreement.
Individual member states of the EU have taken on various quantitative commitments to contribute to the
overall 8 per cent EU abatement target. The UK's contribution is an abatement target of 12.5 per cent. In addition, however, the UK has unilaterally stated a policy goal of reducing CO2 emissions to 20 per cent below
1990 levels by 2010.
Although there are both political and economic obstacles, it seems clear that pricing measures of some sort
(either in the form of carbon taxes or emissions trading) must inevitably form part of the long-term policy
package, if significant reductions are to be achieved in the use of carbon-based energy. Reducing emissions
of carbon dioxide sufficiently to halt the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would require farreaching changes in patterns of energy use, and, more fundamentally, in patterns of human activity. Reliance
on the conventional instruments of environmental policy alone, such as direct regulation of emissions or
technologies, financial incentives to develop or adopt new technologies, and various forms of exhortation and
propaganda runs the risk of being wholly inadequate to the scale of the changes required in carbon dioxide
emissions. Alternatively, if such instruments are to be used to achieve changes in fossil fuel use on the scale
required, they would require such extensive regulatory intervention into the detailed workings of the economy
that the efficient working of the market economy could be undermined.
The United Kingdom has in recent years taken an increasingly market-based approach to environmental
regulation in a number of fields, including climate change policy. The UK's Climate Change Programme includes a significant tax on industrial energy use, as well arrangements for carbon emissions trading. The tax
on industrial and commercial energy use, the 'Climate Change Levy', was announced in the 1999 Budget
and took effect from April 2001. It takes the form of a tax per unit of energy used by industry, at initial rates of
0.15 pence per kWh for coal and natural gas, 0.43 pence for electricity, and 0.07 pence for liquid petroleum
gas. There are exemptions from the tax for energy generated in CHP (combined heat and power) plants, and
for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. An 80 per cent discount from the Climate
Change Levy is awarded to energy-intensive sectors which have negotiated 'Climate Change Agreements'
with the environment department (DEFRA), under which they have taken on collective quantitative targets for
improvements in energy-efficiency or carbon emissions. The Climate Change Agreements then function as
the baseline in a baseline-and-credit emissions trading scheme.
This paper comments on a number of issues concerning the use of taxes and emissions trading in UK and
European climate change policy. Following this introduction, and by way of policy context for some of the
later discussion, Section 2 outlines briefly the economic issues underpinning international climate change
policy, and the main features of the Kyoto Protocol. Section 3 discusses the UK's Climate Change Programme. Section 4 focuses on some issues prompted by UK and international experience. Section 5 draws
some conclusions.
The Policy Context: International Climate Change Policy
While the scientific and environmental issues surrounding the carbon tax debate have been extensively researched, and a major effort by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided a consensus analysis which has been broadly accepted by governments as the basis for policy intervention, the
economic issues remain contentious.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 26
The economic issues
Economists would naturally tend to think of global warming policy in terms of a conceptual framework which
draws together the various relevant costs and benefits.
On the one hand, we need to weigh up the damage costs of global warming, in terms of the consequences of higher global temperatures, increased climatic volatility, etc. How large would these
costs be if global warming were to be allowed to continue unchecked, and by how much would
these costs be reduced if carbon dioxide emissions were to be reduced by various given percentages?
On the other hand, we need to assess the abatement costs of controlling the carbon dioxide emissions that are the source of the problem; these may include higher production costs of more energy-efficient equipment, reductions in household living standards if certain energy-using activities
such as travel and tourism have to be curtailed, a greater risk of catastrophic accidents if we switch
away from fossil fuels towards nuclear power, etc.
The issue of emissions control is not, of course, a simple all-or-nothing choice, but involves a range of possible degrees of stringency. If we decide to do anything at all about global warming, how much should we do?
The economist's approach would be to look at this question in terms of the relationship between marginal
costs and benefits, in other words, the costs and benefits of each successive tightening of the policy. The
conclusion (given certain conditions about the relationship between marginal costs and benefits and the level
of abatement) would then be that policy should be tightened (i.e. emissions reduced) up until the point where
an extra unit of emissions reduction is more costly than the benefits it yields. So long as all relevant costs
and benefits are included in the analysis, this would be the optimal reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
Although it is relatively straightforward to set out this conceptual framework, it is much harder to operationalise it in practice. Estimating the benefits from abatement, in particular, is far from easy. Despite the work of
IPCC to clarify the scientific and environmental effects of greenhouse gas emissions, enormous uncertainty
still surrounds both the magnitude and timing of the various climatic effects (on global temperatures, climatic
volatility, and the climate of particular regions). There is, likewise, disagreement and uncertainty about some
key issues that would be central to an economic assessment of the costs of any particular climate change
scenario, including the relative weight to be given to the interests of current and future generations (i.e. the
discount rate to be applied to future costs and benefits), the valuation of biodiversity effects, the role of equity
weighting in assessing the costs of damage in rich and poor countries, etc.
Tol et al. (2000) provide a survey of estimates of the damage costs of climate change, and Table 1 summarises their discussion of the key reasons for differences in the estimates of these costs. Most studies assess
the marginal damage costs of current carbon dioxide emissions at between $5 and $20 per tonne of carbon,
but some estimates are considerably higher, in excess of $100 per tonne. These higher estimates are typically obtained in studies that assume high physical vulnerability to climate change, or give higher weight to
the interests of future generations (reflected in lower discount rates), or where an equity weighting is used
that places greater weight on each dollar of damage in poorer countries. Tol (1999), for example, has a 'best
guess' estimate of marginal damage costs of $9 per tonne of carbon, using a 3 per cent interest rate and no
equity weighting. This rises to $23 at a 1 per cent discount rate and $73/ tonne at a zero discount rate. With
an equity weighting to place higher value on effects in developing countries, Tol's estimates rise to $26/tonne
(3 per cent discount rate) and $171/tonne (zero discount rate). Tol et al. (2000) note that uncertainty about
marginal damage costs is right-skewed, so that the expected value of marginal damage costs (i.e. the mean)
generally lies significantly above the 'best guess' estimate, or, as they put it, 'nasty surprises are more likely
than pleasant surprises'. Nordhaus (1994), for example, estimates marginal damage costs per tonne of carbon, using a 3 per cent discount rate, at $5 (best guess) and $12 (expected value).

Assumptions about physical processes
There are uncertainties about some of the key physical
processes involved in global warming, affecting the rate of
climate change, its geographical pattern, the possibility of
abrupt discontinuities, etc.
Assumptions about economic responses
There are different approaches to modelling adaptation to
climate change. These differ in terms of the speed, scale
and costs of adaptation by private sector decision-makers.
Government policy interventions may also reduce adaptation costs.
Scope of the analysis
Studies differ in terms of geographical scope (which countries are included, and in how much detail?), and time horizon (how are distant benefits and costs treated?
Welfare criteria
The discount rate employed affects the weighting given to
effects in the distant future (and hence to the weight given to
the interests of future generations). Some studies also include explicit distributional weighting.
Source: Based on the discussion in Tol et al. (2000).
Despite the great uncertainty about the basic facts and forecasts of global warming and its economic consequences, it may not be possible to postpone policy action until conclusive evidence has been obtained, without in the meantime risking irreversible changes in climate and in the global environment. Although it could
turn out that gradual adaptation of the pattern of economic activity and human settlement might be far
cheaper than prevention, the risk of catastrophic and irreversible climatic effects would justify some level of
precautionary policy to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. Where policy measures can be taken which have
low cost (including any 'no regrets' measures), immediate action would avoid the risk of irreversible damage,
whilst leaving the full range of policy options open, should future studies make major revisions to the scientific and economic assessments of the risks of global warming. This, then, would imply that some policy action should be taken now, if for no other reason than as an insurance policy against the eventuality that the
most pessimistic forecasts of global warming turn out to be right.
International co-ordination: the Kyoto deal and EU implementation
To be effective, action to combat climate change has to be taken by all countries (or, at least, a large part of
the world economy), acting in concert. Since global warming is a function of global emissions of greenhouse
gases, the impact on global warming of national policy measures taken by any individual country acting
alone will be negligible, since they can at best reduce that country's carbon dioxide emissions, and the emissions of any individual country (other perhaps than the US, China and the former Soviet Union) constitute a
small percentage of the global total.

Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'Annex I' countries (industrialised market economies, and formerly centrallyplanned 'transition' economies) are assigned targets to limit or reduce their emissions of key greenhouse
gases. The emission limitations and reduction obligations cover a weighted 'basket' of the six gases shown in
Table 2.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 28
The EU negotiated a single commitment (a 'bubble' covering the EU) on behalf of member states. The member states subsequently reached a 'burden-sharing' agreement in 1998 which divided the EU total commitment as shown in Table 4. Within this agreement, some member states are permitted to increase emissions
up to a specified percentage, reflecting the fact that the process of economic development will tend naturally
to lead to increased emissions.
The rules for entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol require 55 Parties to the Convention to ratify the Protocol,
including Annex I Parties accounting for 55 per cent of that group's carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. Since
the USA has declared that it will not ratify the Protocol, the prospects for the Protocol turn on ratification by
other large industrialised and transition countries. Most have now ratified, and Russia's pending decision
whether or not to ratify now seems likely to be the decisive event, which would achieve the required percentage coverage.
In addition to ratification, the success of the Kyoto Protocol, even in the rather limited sense attainable in the
absence of US participation, will depend crucially on whether the commitments that countries have entered
into are achieved in practice. The current evidence on EU performance is, at best, mixed (Table 4). Two of
the largest countries, Germany and the UK, appear likely to meet their emission reduction targets on current
evidence. But three other large countries, France, Italy and Spain are currently forecast by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) to fall short of their commitments, and, in aggregate, and on the basis of current
policies, the EEA forecasts that the EU as a whole might achieve a reduction of some 5 per cent in emissions, compared with the 8 per cent Kyoto commitment.

The Role of Market Mechanisms in UK Climate Change Policy
3.1.
The case for market mechanisms
The case for market mechanisms in environmental policy comes from the recognition of the limitations of environmental policies pursued solely through conventional regulatory instruments. Increasingly, there is recognition that some environmental problems cannot be tackled purely as technical issues, to be resolved
straightforwardly through regulations requiring the use of appropriate abatement technologies. To make any
serious impact on global warming, environmental policies will need to achieve extensive and far-reaching
changes to existing patterns of production and consumption. Achieving the necessary changes will inevitably
entail substantial economic costs. The search for instruments capable of minimising the costs of environmental regulation, and capable of achieving behavioural changes across all sectors, has led policy-makers in
the last decade to pay much closer attention to the potential for incentive-based environmental regulation,
through taxes, charges, tradable permits, and other 'economic instruments'. Advocates of market mechanisms have stressed the potential for efficiency gains (greater cost-effectiveness) in environmental policy
when the price mechanism is used to encourage reduced pollution than when 'command and control' regulatory policies are applied.
3.2.
Policy developments in the UK
Since the 1980s, UK environmental policy has, at least in principle, been favourably disposed towards the
case for employing market mechanisms. A clear statement of the potential contribution that could be made
by "market mechanisms" in environmental policy was included in the 1990 environment White Paper, "This
Common Inheritance" (Department of the Environment, 1990) and subsequently reiterated in other DoE and
Treasury documents. (Jordan et al, 2003)
From the mid-1990s onwards, both Conservative and Labour Chancellors of the Exchequer have included
environmental tax measures within annual budget proposals, and a number of environmental tax measures
have now been implemented. These have recently included a tax on industrial energy use, implemented as
part of the wider Climate Change Strategy. However, the process by which this tax came to be accepted has
been complicated, and the measure finally implemented bears scars and imperfections that reflect a number
of the earlier controversies and false starts in this area of policy.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 30
The European Commission's proposal for a carbon-energy tax in the early 1990s (European Commission,
1991) was opposed by the UK government, primarily on the grounds of fiscal sovereignty (Zito, 2000). However, as the 1990s progressed it became clear that the UK would have other difficulties in implementing a
carbon tax in this form, even if the issue of sovereignty were somehow overcome, and if the tax were to be
introduced in an international context (extensive international co-ordination) where significant issues of competitiveness were avoided.
In 1994, the UK government ended VAT zero-rating on domestic energy as part of a package of revenueraising measures. The decision raised such a political storm that the initial proposal to tax energy at the
standard VAT rate of 17.5 per cent was abandoned half-way, and subsequent retreats have reduced the tax
rate on energy to 5 per cent. This unhappy experience seems to have been etched into the consciousness of
politicians of all the major UK parties, and higher taxes on consumer energy spending, for environmental or
any other reasons, seem to be regarded as politically impossible. The only scope, it would appear, for employing energy taxes within the UK's climate change policy, has been to confine proposals to taxes on the
industrial use of energy, where the "fuel poverty" objections that had such political resonance in the VAT debate do not apply.
The Labour government elected in 1997 began giving serious consideration to the possibility of taxing industrial energy use. A Task Force, chaired by Lord Marshall, reported in late 1998 on the scope for using economic instruments to reduce energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases by the industrial and commercial sectors. Its report argued that a 'mixed approach' would be needed, combining existing forms of regulation with economic instruments, to provide clear signals for longer-term emissions reductions (Marshall Report, 1998).
The Climate Change Levy
The 1999 Budget announced the introduction of a new tax on industrial and commercial energy use, the
'Climate Change Levy', as part of the government's Climate Change Programme. The tax took effect from
April 2001. It takes the form of a single-stage excise, imposed at the time of supply to energy users in industry, the public sector and agriculture. Fuels supplied for transport, for non-fuel uses, for electricity generation
and to the household sector are exempted from the tax. The tax is applied to gas, coal, non-transport LPG
and electricity, at the rates per unit of energy shown in Table 5; these rates have remained unchanged since
the introduction of the tax. There are exemptions from the tax for energy generated in 'good quality' CHP
(combined heat and power) plants, for fuels derived from waste, and for renewable energy sources such as
wind and solar power.
An 80 per cent discount from the Climate Change Levy is awarded to energy-intensive sectors which have
negotiated 'Climate Change Agreements' with the environment department (DEFRA), under which they have
taken on collective quantitative targets for improvements in energy-efficiency or carbon emissions. Initially,
the energy-intensive sectors qualifying for climate change agreements, and hence for this discount, were defined on the basis of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, but in 2003 the government announced that it was considering broadening the scope of CCAs beyond the sectors defined as
energy-intensive on the IPPC criteria.

Revenues raised from the tax (approximately 1 billion in a full year) are mainly used to finance a reduction
of 0.3 percentage points in the rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions. A small part of the revenues (currently less than 5 per cent) is assigned to the Carbon Trust, an organisation established to stimulate the development and adoption of low-carbon technology. Overall, the Climate Change Levy was introduced on a revenue-neutral basis, raising no net revenues.
The evolution of this tax has shown the political difficulties of immediate introduction of large-scale environmental taxes on energy (Pearce, 2001). The political legacy of the previous government's attempt to impose
standard-rate VAT on domestic energy has been that the Climate Change Levy excludes the domestic sector. This obviously foregoes the possibility of equal energy-saving incentives in the domestic and business
sectors, but, less obviously, has led to some messy compromises in the design of the tax, requiring it to be
imposed nearer the point at which energy is sold to final users, so that the domestic sector can be exempted.
Fear of the impact that a tax on carbon content might have on the coal industry has led the government to
choose energy content, rather than carbon content as the base for the tax, thus foregoing the possibility that
carbon emissions could be reduced through fuel-switching incentives. Concern about the impact of the tax
on the competitiveness of energy-intensive sectors has led to arrangements that will exempt these sectors
from the levy, in return for negotiated agreements with these sectors to achieve equivalent improvements in
energy efficiency. This again complicates the design of the levy, reduces further the proportion of the economy experiencing the incentive effects of the tax, and relies on the questionable assertion that the negotiated
agreements will achieve energy savings at least as great as those that the Levy would achieve.
Climate Change Agreements
'Climate Change Agreements' are negotiated agreements between sectoral industry organisations and the
government. 43 industry associations, representing some 6000 companies, have negotiated CCAs with the
environment department (DEFRA), under which they have taken on collective quantitative targets for improvements in energy-efficiency or carbon emissions, in return for an 80 per cent discount from the Climate
Change Levy.
The agreements can, in principle, take a number of different forms. They can relate either to carbon emissions, or to energy use. In addition, they may be specified in either absolute or relative terms, in other words,
as a reduction of energy use or emissions in tonnes, or as a reduction in the rate of energy use or emissions
per unit of output. In practice, the overwhelming majority (38 of the 43 agreements) have set targets for energy use, relative to output, in other words, have been agreements for improvements in energy efficiency.
Four agreements have specified absolute targets for reduced energy use  those concerning agricultural
suppliers, steel, supermarkets and wall coverings. One agreement, for the aluminium industry, sets a target
for emissions, relative to output.
The agreements all have a two-tier structure, specifying obligations for the sector as a whole, and translating
these obligations into targets for each individual firm. Enforcement procedures pay attention both to the sectoral outcome, and to individual firms' responsibility for the sectoral outcome. No enforcement action is taken
if the sector as a whole meets its obligations, but where the sector falls short of its target, non-compliant
firms are identified and are open to penalties.
Each CCA sets a final target for 2010, and interim targets for alternate years (2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008).
Compliance arrangements differ as between the interim and final targets. Failure to meet the target in one of
the interim years carries a penalty in the form of the loss of the 80 per cent Climate Change Levy discount for
the subsequent two years, while failure to meet the 2010 target is penalised by a requirement to repay all of
the CCL discount that the firm has enjoyed over the lifetime of the agreement.

Emissions trading
The third element in the Climate Change Programme was an emissions trading scheme for greenhouse
gases, which was launched in April 2002, with an initial five year lifespan (2002-06). The scheme aims to
provide flexibility for individual firms in their compliance with greenhouse gas abatement obligations, so as to
reduce the economic cost of achieving a given abatement total. A second, overt, objective of the emissions
trading scheme is to establish the London financial markets as the global location for environmental permit
trading. The scheme regulates overall emissions of the six groups of greenhouse gases covered by the
Kyoto Protocol (Table 2), weighted according to global warming potential. Individual emission limits defined
under the scheme, and the unit used for trading, are defined in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent
(tCO2-e)26.
There are two groups of potential participants in emissions trading, referred to as "agreement participants"
and "direct participants".
Agreement participants are the 6000 firms covered by Climate Change Agreements (CCAs). These
firms can generate and sell allowances by exceeding their negotiated emission-reduction targets,
or alternatively, can achieve compliance with their obligations under the agreement by purchasing
permits in place of some or all of their abatement obligations. For these firms, emissions trading is
effectively a baseline-and-credit system of emissions trading, and participation in trading by individual firms is wholly voluntary.
Direct participants are the 31 firms who entered the scheme as a result of an incentive auction
conducted by the government in March 200227. In the ETS auction it was open to any organisation
to offer abatement of its UK emissions over the period 2002-6, as against baseline emissions in
1998-2000. The auction aimed to "buy" as much abatement as possible, using a fixed budget of
215m. The auction was conducted using a descending clock format, with a starting price per
tonne of abatement in 2006 of 10028. After nine auction rounds a market-clearing price was established of 53.37 per tonne of CO2-equivalent, and the 31 DPs were assigned abatement commitments totalling 3.96 million tonnes of CO2 (1.1 million tonnes C) in 2006, and the corresponding
phased abatement obligations for the intermediate years.
An evaluation of the first year of ETS (DEFRA, 2003) reported some 200 trades, involving about 1 million allowances. In aggregate the direct participants substantially exceeded, by a factor of almost 5, their abatement targets for the first year (set at 20% of the abatement required in 2006), achieving aggregate abatement of 4.46mtCO2-e compared with a target of 0.79 mtCO2-e. Only two of the 31 direct participants fell significantly short of their 2002 target, and about a dozen had significant over-compliance. Two firms in particular accounted for a large part of the total abatement, each achieving more than one million tonnes of carbondioxide equivalent abatement in excess of their 2002 target. Direct participants as a group were consequently substantial net sellers of allowances to agreement participants. A report by the National Audit Office
(2004) drew attention to the ease with which some direct participants have achieved their targets, and has
suggested that this may partly reflect failings in the way that baseline emissions levels were assigned to participants. The emissions of a number of DPs were already well below their baseline at the start of the
scheme, and as a result they may have been able to achieve compliance without further abatement action. It
is suggested that this over-generosity in the allocation of baseline emissions levels may partly reflect the
short timescale in which the allocations had to be made, and also may reflect the difficulty experienced in
finding enough firms willing to participate in the auction29.
Prices at which allowances have traded since the start of emissions trading have been substantially lower
than those paid in the March 2002 ETS auction. The auction closing price of 53.37 per tonne of abatement
in 2006 is equivalent to a price of 17.79 per tonne of abatement in a single year, once the intermediate-year
commitments implied by the 2006 target are taken into account. Market trading appears to have begun at a
price of about 6 per tonne, about one third of the level of the 17.79 auction price, rising to a peak of about
12 per tonne in October 2002, and then declining to about 3 by the end of the year (NAO, 2004, page 24).
The basic unit of the system, tonnes of carbon dioxide, can be converted into tonnes of carbon, the units more commonly used in discussion of the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, by multiplying by 0.273. Equivalently, a price of x per tonne of carbon dioxide
corresponds to a price per tonne of carbon of 3.67x.
A further three firms were successful bidders in the auction, but subsequently withdrew.
Direct participants were required to achieve their specified level of abatement in 2006, and to make phased progress towards it in the
intermediate years 2002-5, with the 2002 target being 20% of the 2006 target, rising to 40%, 60% and 80% in each of the subsequent
years. As a result, a direct participant making a commitment to abate by 1 tonne in 2006 would be committed to a total abatement of 3
tonnes over the period 2002-6 as a whole.
Despite extensive marketing efforts the auction was postponed twice in an attempt to attract more participants.

A complication to the trading scheme arises because most of the sectoral Climate Change Agreements have
been defined in relative terms, in other words as targets for energy use per unit of output, while other parts of
the scheme are specified in absolute terms. Trading between the absolute and relative sectors could potentially erode the effectiveness of the overall scheme in terms of control of overall emissions. Firms in the relative sector can comply with their obligation even if their emissions increase, so long as they are experiencing
a sufficiently large growth in output. If such firms exceed their targets, and then sell permits to firms in the
absolute sector, emissions in both sectors could potentially rise. To prevent this outcome, the scheme includes a mechanism, the "Gateway", to restrict the flow of allowances from the regulative to the absolute
sector. Individual sales of allowances by firms in the relative sector to firms in the absolute sector are permitted, only if there is no net aggregate flow of allowances out of the relative sector into the absolute sector. In
practice, the Gateway controlling the flow of allowances from the relative sector to the absolute sector has
been open continuously since the scheme began, reflecting the large generation of surplus allowances
through over-compliance by the direct participants.
ROCs and EECs
In addition to the "direct" and "agreement" participants in emissions trading, there are two further groups of
potential participants in the market, electricity producers, who are subject to an obligation to use a given level
of renewable sources for electricity generation, and electricity and gas suppliers, who have targets to achieve
energy efficiency improvements in the domestic sector. Over-compliance with these obligations on energy
producers and energy suppliers creates certificates (Renewables Obligation Certificates and Energy Efficiency Certificates respectively), which are convertible into tradeable emission permits, valid in the emissions
trading scheme.
For example, the Renewables Obligation, introduced in April 2002, requires all electricity suppliers to demonstrate to the energy market regulator (the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, OFGEM) that they have
sourced a specified percentage of their output from renewable sources. For 2002 the required percentage
was set at 3%, to rise in stages to 10.4% by 2010. Compliance is demonstrated through Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), which are tradeable. Each ROC represents 1MWh of electricity generated from renewable sources (e.g. landfill gas, wind power, biomass, some hydro, etc). Firms have the option of "buying
out" their obligation at a set price of 30 per MWh in 2002, indexed for subsequent years, which places an
upper bound to the cost per MWh of complying with the Renewables Obligation. The revenue generated by
buyouts is redistributed to suppliers sourcing renewable energy, in proportion to their use of renewables.
ROCs can be banked to a limited extent, and can be converted to Emissions Trading allowances at 0.43 allowances per ROC.
The primary purpose of allowing these certificates to be traded within the wider emissions trading scheme is
to ensure that they can be traded in a reasonably active and liquid market. Without the link to the wider
scheme, ROCs and EECs would have to be traded in a rather thin market, with a limited number of potential
participants, many of whom would perceive the other participants as direct product market competitors. Willingness to trade might be inhibited by this. In addition, there might be problems of monopoly power in the
permit market from the small number of market players, and there might be relatively few buyers and sellers
at any particular time. Linking these markets to the wider market obviously carries with it the risk that trading
might erode the achievement of the specific objective for renewables, or for energy efficiency, but does have
the significant advantage that these certificates can be traded in a much more active and efficient market.
Reflections on UK policy and the future
The Climate Change Levy
The UK Climate Change Levy has attracted considerable criticism for not being a coherently-structured carbon tax (e.g. Helm). As Table 5 showed, the rate at which the Climate Change Levy is applied to different fuels varies considerably, if considered in terms of the rate of tax per tonne of carbon. This "implicit carbon tax"
varies from about 11 per tonne of carbon in the case of LPG, to about 30 per tonne of carbon in the case of
gas and electricity. In practice, probably the most significant issue is that coal is taxed much less heavily,
relative to other fuels, than it would be if carbon embodied in all fuels was taxed at a uniform rate. The reason for the relatively generous treatment of coal within the UK CCL has been the government's concern
about the political impact of further accelerating the run-down of the domestic mining industry. How far is this
uneven tax on carbon a serious economic objection to the UK arrangements?
A 'first-best' tax structure for an excise tax to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions would achieve the most efficient pattern of abatement responses by taxing fuels in proportion to their carbon content. Different fossil fuels would therefore be taxed at different rates per unit of energy. Fuels with a higher carbon content per unit
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 34
of energy (such as coal, for example) would bear a higher tax burden than fuels with a lower carbon content
per unit of energy (such as natural gas). Such a tax structure, combined with tax rates set at the first-best
level, would encourage efficient responses, of two sorts. By raising the price of energy relative to other industrial inputs, and relative to other household spending, the carbon tax would act to discourage energy use in
general. In addition, by raising the price of fuels differentially, in proportion to their carbon content, the tax
would encourage substitution away from high-carbon energy sources towards lower-carbon fuels. Both the
reduction in overall energy use and the substitution towards lower-carbon fuels would have the effect of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.
However, if the overall level of energy taxation is, for some reason, constrained below the first-best level, it
may no longer be appropriate to tax fuels in proportion to their carbon content. The direction in which the
relative taxation of fuels should then depart from the 'carbon yardstick' will reflect the nature of the constraints. Constraints on the aggregate burden of energy taxes, for example, will imply that the tax structure
should be designed to maximise the environmental impact from the relatively low environmental taxes that
are feasible. This would require the tax structure to be shifted in the direction of taxing relatively more heavily
those fuels where consumption responses are price-elastic, and taxing less heavily those fuels in more inelastic demand.
This line of argument might, for example, justify tackling carbon emissions with higher taxes on motor fuels
than on other energy sources, if demand for the former is thought to be more price-responsive than the latter.
However, there are potential efficiency losses if fuels are taxed at different rates, without any justification in
terms of differential elasticity, or if undue weight is placed on the more elastic energy uses. It will be noted
that the implicit rate of carbon tax on motor fuels is already very high in all EU countries. Baranzini, Goldemberg and Speck (2000) estimate that existing taxes on petrol in France, Germany and the UK are equivalent
to carbon taxes of some $750 - $950 per tonne of carbon (while the implicit carbon tax on petrol in the US
was some $150 per tonne of carbon). Unless a substantial part of this higher tax can be justified in terms of
other (non-climate change) externalities an efficient structure of incentives for carbon abatement would be
likely to require significant reductions in motor fuel taxes, while at the same time increasing the tax rates on
other energy uses, closer to the rate of tax on motor fuels.
The role of the Climate Change Agreements
There is considerable difficulty in attempting to assess the success of the Climate Change Agreements in
securing genuinely-additional energy efficiency improvements or carbon abatement by CCA participants, in
the sense of changes that would not have occurred in the absence of the agreement. There has been controversy over the reductions claimed, relative to baseline, with the Association for Conservation of Energy
(ACE) claiming that the CCA targets amount to little more than 'business as usual', while the government's
consultants, ETSU, claim a substantial difference between the targets and the energy use that would have
occurred in the absence of the agreements (de Muizon and Glachant, 2003).
There are, on the one hand, good reasons to doubt that any government would be in a strong position to negotiate tough abatement targets with industry, given the relatively weak informational position of the government compared to the firms on the other side of the negotiation. Generally the government may be able to do
little more than project past trends, as a business-as-usual baseline for the negotiations, while the industry
side of the negotiation may be in a position to reveal considerably more information, if it helps their case to
do so.
On the other hand, the structure of the climate change agreements being negotiated gave the government
considerable bargaining power, in that the 80 per cent discount on the climate change levy gave the industry
negotiators a strong incentive to reach a successful deal. From the point of view of the firms, a deal would
involve abatement costs on the negotiated reductions, in exchange for 80 per cent of the total Climate
Change Levy bill that they would otherwise pay. It is not possible to be certain that whether the maximum
abatement that it would be worthwhile firms offering in exchange for reaching a Climate Change Agreement
would be higher or lower than the abatement that would be undertaken if the firms instead had to pay the full
rate of Climate Change levy. However, where the Marginal Abatement Cost Schedule is reasonably steep, it
is probable that the maximum that firms would be willing to offer for an agreement would exceed the abatement they would undertake without it. Whether, in practice, the government has been able to extract anything
like this level of abatement in exchange for the negotiated Climate Change Agreements is, however, a different matter.

Emissions Trading issues
How effective has the UK emissions trading system been at reducing the aggregate cost of reductions in energy use and emissions? The market seems reasonably liquid, and an appreciable amount of trading activity
took place as firm approached the end of the first compliance period. However, prices are now quite low, at
around 3 per tonne of carbon dioxide, and well below the auction price of about 20 per tonne, at which the
government sold its budget to finance additional carbon abatement. The relatively low trading prices are an
indication that firms appear to be able to meet their commitments at relatively low marginal abatement cost 
and thus are perhaps an indication that at least some of the climate change agreements impose obligations
that are not in fact particularly demanding. The rather higher auction prices may reflect the difficulties the
government encountered in finding enough willing participants for the auction, and the limited information
available at the time of the auction about the likely future value of carbon allowances. It is noteworthy that the
ex ante assessments of likely permit prices for the US acid rain programme were substantially higher than
the prices at which trading ultimately took place. Whether there are common features lying behind these two
experiences  such as, perhaps, unanticipated cost-reducing innovation in abatement once trading begins 
is unclear.
Moving to EU Emissions Trading
A number of problems will be encountered in integrating the UK emissions trading system with the EU emissions trading regime, scheduled to begin in January 2005. The EU regime will differ from the UK scheme in a
number of ways. Some of these differences will make it difficult to integrate the EU scheme into the UK's existing arrangements. The UK has applied for a temporary exemption from the EU scheme for those firms
within the UK scheme, which will postpone some, but not all, of the adjustment and integration problems.
The key differences between the UK and EU schemes include the following:
The UK scheme is in terms of the weighted basket of greenhouse gases, while the EU scheme is in
terms of carbon dioxide alone.
The time periods of the two schemes differ. The UK Climate Change Agreements run to 2012, with
the first round of the ETS ending at the end 2006, while the first round of the EU scheme begins in
2005 and runs to 2007 with a further period to 2012.
Participation in the UK scheme is voluntary, while the EU scheme is compulsory.
The two schemes treat electricity differently. The UK scheme does not include the electricity industry, while the EU scheme treats the electricity industry like any other industrial sector.
One important difference of some substance between the UK scheme and the EU scheme is that  with the
exception of the relatively small number of direct participants who entered the scheme as a result of the auction  firms participate in the UK scheme only as a result of their participation in a sectoral Climate Change
Agreement. As discussed above, these agreements involve a deal, in which firms are exempted from 80 per
cent of the Climate Change Levy, in exchange for quantitative commitments to reduce energy use or emissions below a 'business-as-usual' baseline. Despite the reservations discussed above about the genuine
'additionality' of some of the abatement undertakings in the negotiated CCAs, the 80 per cent CCL discount
does provide the government with significant bargaining power that it can exploit in negotiating the terms on
which firms enter the UK ETS. It is the abatement required under the CCAs that effectively makes permits
valuable in the UK system, and the ETS provides a way of arbitraging differences in marginal abatement
costs between different firms.
The EU scheme will, by contrast, be compulsory, and will rely for its impact on the constraint on the overall
allowance issue. The price of permits will be greater than zero, because fewer permits will be allocated than
firms' existing emissions. Initially the EU permits will be allocated free ("grandfathering"), though scope has
been left in the Directive for a small proportion of the permits to be auctioned from 2008. Relatively little will
be extracted from firms in exchange for the issue of permits in the EU scheme, and this represents a significant lost opportunity. It is desirable that the EU scheme should seek, as rapidly as is politically feasible, to
move to a situation where firms do not receive permits for free, but where some form of charging is applied to
the initial permit issue.
The most important insight of the 'double dividend' literature concerns the choice between revenue-raising
and non-revenue raising instruments, such as, on the one hand, carbon taxes and auctioned carbon permits,
and, on the other hand, permits issued for free. Apart from the issue of their performance in conditions of uncertainty, there is a close equivalence between tax and tradeable permit instruments. Tradeable permits distributed by auction would trade at a price per tonne of carbon equal to the carbon tax rate that would have
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 36
the same impact on carbon emissions, and the tax revenues and auction receipts would be equal. Tradeable
permits distributed free to existing energy-using firms ('grandfathered' permits) would be equivalent to a carbon tax, the revenues from which were given back to firms as a lump-sum windfall. This latter equivalence
highlights the fiscal wastefulness of grandfathered tradeable permits, in the sense that they forego the opportunity to raise revenues which could be used to cut the rates of existing distortionary taxes in the fiscal system.
Recent work by Parry (2003) indicates the scale of the economic losses that would be involved in wasting
the revenue-raising potential of auctioned tradeable permits (or equivalent, a carbon tax), by distributing
permits free through a grandfathering allocation process. On his estimates, a revenue-raising instrument
such as carbon tax or the equivalent auctioned permits, set at $20 per tonne of carbon, would produce an
annual welfare gain of somewhat over $1 billion, while grandfathering rather than auctioning permits would
generate an overall welfare loss of some $6 billion annually. Grandfathered permits may perhaps have political attractions, in buying off the opposition of affected firms, but they have the potential to do substantial
economic damage by foregoing revenues which could be used to cut other tax rates.
Looking ahead: the future form of international co-ordination
Following the USA's decision not to ratify the Kyoto treaty, there has been increasing discussion about the
future shape of international climate change policies. Part of this has concerned the deficiencies in the structure of the Kyoto agreement that made participation unattractive for the US30, while other work has considered more general deficiencies in the structure of Kyoto-type deals, and the merits of alternative approaches,
including those based on agreements to co-ordinate carbon 'prices' rather to agree quantity targets.31
A key issue, in my opinion, which has been given insufficient attention in the development of the current
agreements, is the issue of credibility, and its relationship, with issues of visibility and verifiability (Smith,
1995). The international agreements on climate change have, to-date, set targets for emissions levels for the
countries signing the agreement, but have not specified the policy measures which should be taken in order
to meet these emissions levels. This might be argued to be a sensible approach. Individual countries may be
in a better position to judge the measures needed to meet their particular national target, and they may have
a much better awareness of the political constraints on policy, so that they can avoid measures which would
be liable to face excessive domestic opposition. However, it does have a drawback which needs to be noted.
This is that individual countries may not necessarily act in the interests of the global community in their domestic implementation of an international agreement on climate change policy. Since the impact of any individual country's emission reductions on the global climate is small, the benefit to the country itself from its
own domestic carbon dioxide control policy will generally also be small. The country may gain significantly
from the co-ordinated international policy, but may perceive its own actions as involving large domestic costs
(of abatement measures, etc.) but negligible domestic benefit. In these circumstances, there is an incentive
for the country to free ride, if it can, on the international agreement, by taking no action itself to control carbon dioxide emissions, but still hoping to benefit from the actions taken by other countries. Such a strategy
is, of course, more attractive if other signatories to the global agreement cannot see when free-riding is taking place.
It is at least arguable that an international agreement which specifies targets, but which does not specify the
policy measures which should be taken to meet these targets, will be particularly prone to free-riding by individual signatories. Countries face an emissions target for a date in the future, and their compliance with the
target can only be fully judged when the future date is reached. They may fail to meet the target despite trying to do so, if their policy was knocked off-course by unexpected events; alternatively, they may meet the
target even without trying, if other factors reduce their emissions over the period. Achieving the target, ex
post, is therefore a poor indicator of the ex ante adequacy of the measures taken. Compliance monitoring
may therefore be difficult. At the same time, countries face considerable temptation to put little effort into
meeting the targets. If the date is sufficiently far in the future, the current generation of politicians may expect
to have retired, and, even if they expect to be still in office, they may place higher weight on the immediate
domestic opposition to the costs of abatement policies than on the costs of international disapproval if they
do not meet their target. In these circumstances, where compliance is costly and non-compliance cannot
easily be observed by other signatories to the agreement, the risk that countries will try to free-ride on the actions of others is high.
See, for example, the discussion in McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2003), Nordhaus (2002), and Aldy et al. (2003).
Nordhaus (2002), and Pizer (1998) and Newell and Pizer (2000) argue that there are significant advantages to price-based agreements. McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2002, 2003) argue for a hybrid mechanism with both price and quantity elements.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 37
By contrast, an international agreement which specifies the measures to be taken may have the attraction
that compliance with the agreement can be readily verified. This will be particularly true where the policy
measures required are of a straightforward, transparent, and non-discretionary form. A carbon tax has these
characteristics, and it may be relatively straightforward for countries to observe whether or not all of the signatories to an international agreement on carbon taxation have indeed introduced a tax in compliance with
the terms of the agreement. Where they can do this, the chance is increased that individual countries will
comply with the agreement.
This conclusion, that it would be preferable to agree on co-ordinated use of the carbon tax rather than on a
series of national quantitative targets for emissions reductions, also fits in with the conclusions of some other
recent strands of thinking among economists. A key issue has been how different agreements are affected
by the nature of the uncertainties about climate change costs and benefits. Pizer (1998) and Newell and
Pizer (2000) develop the insights of the literature on instrument choice under uncertainty to argue that the
uncertainties in climate change point strongly in favour of using instruments that regulate the level of emissions by price (such as a carbon tax) rather than those that regulate by fixing an emissions quantity (as with
a system of tradeable permits). The key observation is that the level of climate change damage is a function
of the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with the result that variation in annual emissions probably has a broadly constant marginal effect on climate change damage. On the other hand, marginal abatement costs may well be highly sensitive to the level of abatement. In these circumstances the costs of error
in policy are likely to be lower when price-based emissions regulation is employed than when tradeable permits or other fixed quantity targets are set.
Nordhaus (2002) enumerates further potential advantages of basing future international agreements on climate change around harmonised carbon taxes, rather than country-by-country quantitative targets. He argues that quantity-based international agreements are more liable than harmonised taxes to lead to excessive volatility in the price signals facing polluters (i.e. volatility in permit prices), that they may be more vulnerable to risks of fraud and corruption, that they expose governments to the temptation to grandfather allowances for free rather than to use revenue-raising instruments and that they raise difficult 'baseline credit'
arguments which a carbon tax would neatly sidestep.32
Conclusions
The Kyoto protocol commits signatories to substantial restraint in greenhouse gas emissions. Across the EU
as a whole, emissions of the weighted 'basket' of six greenhouse gases are required to be cut by 8 per cent
by 2008/12, as compared with emissions in the agreement's base year, 1990. For individual member states,
varying targets have been agreed. For the UK, the EU agreement requires that 2008-12 emissions should be
at least 12.5 per cent lower than in 1990. In addition, the UK government has declared a policy goal of reducing CO2 emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010 . By 2000, however, UK abatement appeared
on track for the 12.5 per cent Kyoto target, though not necessarily the higher 20% limit. A number of other
member states will need to make significant changes to current trends in energy use and if they are to meet
their emissions targets.
Member states have discretion over the policies to be adopted to achieve the Kyoto targets. Most member
states have relied heavily on conventional 'command-and-control' instruments of environmental policy such
as direct regulation of emissions or technologies, supplemented by financial incentives to develop or adopt
new technologies, and various forms of information provision and moral exhortation. 'Voluntary agreements'
with major energy-using sectors have also been a frequent ingredient in the portfolio of climate change policies, although there is a danger that such agreements may consist of little more than hot air, and may
achieve little that would not have happened in any case. A number of member states are making use of various forms of market mechanism, including carbon and energy taxes, to discourage energy use, or carbon dioxide emissions, through the price mechanism.
This paper has described the three, interlocking, elements of the UK Climate Change programme, the Climate Change Levy, Climate Change Agreements, and Emissions Trading. The offer of an 80 per cent discount on the Climate Change Levy has played a key role in encouraging industrial sectors to negotiate Climate Change Agreements with specified sectoral targets for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, or for
improvements in energy efficiency. For those firms which are not part of a negotiated Climate Change
Agreement the levy provides an incentive for reduced energy use (at roughly half the level that would have
been given by the EU carbon/energy tax proposed in 1990). Those firms that are included within a Climate
Change Agreement face clear and enforceable individual targets for reduced energy use, together with fur32
Aldy et al. (2003) are more sceptical about the value of basing future agreements on harmonised taxes.

ther incentives from two sources, the remaining 20 per cent of the Climate Change Levy, and the opportunity
to obtain credit for reductions in excess of their agreement target, and to sell this in the Emissions Trading
system.
The paper has noted a number of issues about the UK arrangements:
the uneven tax per unit of carbon implied by the uniform tax rates per unit of energy on coal and
the treatment of electricity as a fuel product, subject to the levy at a higher rate, rather than as an
industry using taxed input fuels
the restriction of the Climate Change Levy to industrial and commercial users of energy, and the
exemption of the household sector, which means that the system does not provide equivalent incentives for reductions in household energy use
complications introduced into the trading regime by the existence of both relative and absolute
abatement targets. Special arrangements (the "Gateway") have been needed to ensure that trading
between the relative and absolute sectors does not undermine the effectiveness of the system as a
whole. In practice, because the absolute sector has been a net seller of permits these arrangements have not imposed any major constraint on trading, but in other circumstances they could
have done
the difficulty of measuring the success of the Climate Change Agreements, and their dependence
on negotiations between industry bodies and the government, in which the government has a relatively weak informational position
over-compliance by participants, and consequent weak prices for permits
future problems in integrating the UK system with the EU emissions trading regime, scheduled to
begin in January 2005
In the medium term, if countries continue to try to control global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy pricing measures, such as carbon taxes and emissions trading, should become increasingly
important in the overall policy mix. Achieving the major changes that will be needed in patterns of energy use
and economic activity through the use of conventional, inflexible 'command-and-control' would be liable to
damage the efficient functioning of the market economy. The package of instruments being employed by the
UK provides important evidence on the ways in which effective use can be made of incentive-based approaches to greenhouse gas abatement. The move to EU wide emissions trading will greatly expand the use
of market-based instruments by signatories to the Kyoto Protocol.

Introduction
All societies have sets of conflicting objectives. For
example, one objective is that of raising revenues to
meet what I think in most of our societies are constantly
increasing expectations, which are proving more or less
impossible to fund. I think that's very clear. Our
government in the UK has been under our present
chancellor notoriously skilful at extending the range of
taxes. I do not know whether you're familiar with the frog
principle  if you put a frog in boiling water, it will jump
out, but if you put it in cold water and warm it up, it
doesn't jump out, it dies. I think we in the UK are subject
to the second principle rather than the first, and the
increasing range of taxation in the UK clearly exposes
this dilemma.
From the perspective of a company like my own  and let
me start by saying BP does pay a lot of tax, everywhere
in the world  the approach we take to the questions
posed by governments and societies can be best characterised as enlightened self-interest. Our approach is
essentially based on looking for constructive solutions to these dilemmas and contradictions, and working to
try and create the space for that. In my opinion, it is very clear from what has gone before that the answers
are very difficult to find. This approach constitutes the basis of everything we have done in terms of climate
change  and please note I am going to restrict my context to global warming and climate change  I do not
intend to deal with ecotaxation or other market instruments in other contexts.
BP acknowledged climate change after Kyoto in 1997 and set ourselves a set of targets to reduce our own
emissions by 10 percent from our base year. Our original goal was to achieve this by 2010 but in fact we had
already achieved it by 2000, and we are now moving on to a rather more challenging set of goals. To put this
into context  our initial focus was entirely on our own operations and in practice we only consume ten percent of all the energy we are in one way or another responsible for handling. So something like 90 percent of
the energy and therefore the emissions that come within our grasp are actually the result of the use of our
product by others  by you and I as motorists, by industry, and so on.
BP recognises the challenge in climate terms of trying to be part of the solution to that very complex and difficult process. It will take us down the road towards new technologies and towards making decisions on what
kind of policy instruments are best to achieve our goals.
BP and the Climate Change Levy
The climate change levy in fact only affected BPs chemical operations, which received an 80 percent reduction, and our gas business, which incurred limited administration costs as a result. Our refineries and oil and
gas operations are subject to other forms of taxation and were therefore exempt from the levy. So it really
impacted only our energy intensive chemicals operations but we were able, by setting the appropriate targets
within BPs larger target setting process, to achieve an exemption from those targets and thus, the impact of
the levy on the company has not been significant.
Having said that, I'd like to pick up on point made by the previous speaker, Professor Stephen Smith, who
said he was very sceptical of the results of the levy. Although I can quite understand why he said that, I
would point out that in terms of finding the answers to global warming, carbon reduction, and transfer to a
lower carbon economy, we are actually at a very early stage, particularly in terms of facing these problems
as issues in themselves as opposed to absorbing what has gone before. For a huge number of companies in
industry it is an embryonic issue: companies like BP have been dealing with this issue in one sense for a
quite short period of time  for five, six, seven years  so I am not surprised that the answers are not clearly
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 41
there to see. What I think is a critical underpinning of any policy approach to climate change is to start the
ball rolling.
Emissions Trading in BP
Let me use BP as an illustration at this point. As I already mentioned, when we took on the goal of reducing
our own greenhouse gases we actually set ourselves targets. The question we had to ask ourselves then
was; if we set ourselves targets, how do we actually go about best achieving those? In our case, we came up
with an internal emissions trading system and the approach behind that was a recognition by our chief executive that he did not actually know where the best answers to this would come from, or from which of the
many BP operations around the world: he didn't know where the marginal cost most effectively would be. So,
instead of giving a series of commands, he set a series of general targets and devised a trading system for
parts of BP to operate within. That way, he believed, we would find the most cost-effective reductions within
our system.
Clearly, any internal system has limitations. In one sense, the money is not real money. But in our case, it
provided a very effective way of focussing on the issue of carbon reduction and carbon management. We
found some $650 million of savings  and although one might ask why on earth BP didnt explore these possibilities before  whether we are in business or not, we are only human and we tend to focus on those
things that either engage our interest or that we are asked to do. So in a well-run company, if safety becomes an issue and management produces a series of notices on safety, people will respond. When we
started to focus on the management of greenhouse gas issues, produced the targets and produced the system, results started to come in.
We stopped the system in 2001 when we moved on  at least within the UK  to the UK emissions trading
system. But our own experience proved for us that emissions trading was a very effective instrument. The
UK emissions trading system has been running for 2 years now  originally there were 35 companies who
entered it directly and of course all the climate change levy companies who entered it less directly  so it is
still at an early stage. If we take it that the principle purpose is to start focussing on the issue of carbon reduction, then I think in some sense we can start scoring success. What clearly has to lie ahead is a review of
what is actually happening - policy must be able to do that.
Emissions Trading in the UK and Europe
You have to try to initiate a policy focus while remaining uncertain of the result. Put it this way: if you wanted
to achieve a very dramatic result in terms of carbon reduction, you would probably have to introduce policies
which would bring about precisely the kind of reaction that is already evident to some of the rather less demanding targets that have been set and you would run the real risk of distorting all kinds of other objectives
and other policies for the achievement of this one goal. But that isn't how life works and it can't work. What
we have to do is to find a set of climate policies, certainly using emissions trading and sensibly taking into
consideration the conundrum of ecotaxes and the role they have to play to start down that road of discovery.
When you begin to see the results, either positive or negative, then you are in a better position to start tuning
the instruments you have put in place.
I would still argue that the way the UK emissions trading process worked, albeit that it didn't deliver the results that some people have asked for, albeit that it started with a grandfathering process (which I do not believe will be the long term consequence)  a very necessary way to introduce the system and get the system
started. In the UK  and I was one of the architects of this  we worked with the government for eighteen
months on emissions trading and we gave them a choice of either setting mandatory targets or incentivising
the process, because there is no way that pro bono publico as companies we are simply going to assume
these commitments on behalf of society. There has to be a policy framework for that. The government decided to introduce an incentivised process and although that was a way of starting the scheme, I believe that
we will transit to some form of auctioning system in the longer term. It won't be easy, it won't be very palatable, but I believe that is the way things will have to develop. The critical thing here was to actually begin the
process.
Trading systems have to start small. We started in our own case in BP with our own internal system then
very much became, with other companies, the architects of the UK trading system, and have been very
closely involved in the development of the EU system, which I sincerely hope will start up at the beginning of
next year. Of course, it will have a lot of teething troubles, but I believe in our talks with the Commission that
by and large we have succeeded in persuading them of the virtues of learning by doing. There will be mistakes, clearly it has to be very flexible in concept and people have to learn to come back and make the nec-
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 42
essary adjustments to achieve a range of goals and of course, in the beginning it is not tackling the difficult
domestic and transport sectors. It is planned to bring both these sectors into play for the next phase in 2007,
which will not be at all easy, but I believe that we should all contribute to the effort of finding the answers,
particularly as I believe that emissions trading will continue to make an important contribution to climate
change policy.
Ideal Economic Instruments
For economic instruments to be efficient they have to be:
well designed, i.e. revenue/investment neutral, influence behaviour according objectives, non inflationary
part of stable long-term policy framework and agreed objectives
non distortive
minimum compliance costs
distributional impact acceptable
according to state aid rules
securing international competitiveness
life cycle based
I think this list will probably be quite familiar to anyone who deals with the system of taxation. The above are
ground rules, quite difficult to follow completely and although they are not unique and not original, they
should not be forgotten. These rules simply point to the challenge that is well understood  it is actually very
difficult to design ecotaxes so that all these conditions are met.
To take the example of motor fuel taxation. There has been considerable debate in Germany about the recent rise in motor fuel taxes  I am uncertain whether these are ecotaxes or revenue raising mechanisms as
I think they clearly are in the UK  and some have claimed that results in terms of energy efficiency gain
have not been achieved as a result of the tax, but are attributable to other developments, such as the recession. Being simplistic and not an economist and having spent the last three years working with a group of oil
and auto companies on future mobility issues, I feel justified in contrasting the efficiency of the US private
vehicle fleet with the efficiency of the European vehicle fleet. One can argue there are a number of reasons
for this contrast, and their economies are not saying that taxation is very clearly a significant difference. But I
believe that we can argue quite successfully that the right kind of targeted tax can have an effect  whether it
is an ecotax or not is quite another issue.
As for the double dividend, I am a little sceptical of it in some ways. If you find that there is something implicitly wrong in the level of social taxation that you are incurring, then it seems to me that it would be better to
address that issue. Secondly, as we have seen in the UK, if you in fact reduce social taxation and transfer it
to a form of ecotaxation, then the resulting distribution is not even. In this case, it is very often the energy intensive industries who end up paying the greater part of the ecological tax, whereas companies who employ
larger numbers of people gain in terms of their tax rebate. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this process in
the UK was ironically enough the government itself, because they have a huge number of employees. There
are some peculiar redistribution effects that need to be taken into account. The notion of the double dividend
needs to be looked at a little bit more closely than I think sometimes it is.
Conclusion
I would like to conclude by reiterating that a combination of policy instruments to achieve carbon reductions
is most certainly in my view going to involve emissions trading and it will very likely involve some form of ecotaxation as well, as I do not believe that that will go away. However, I do think that there are a number of
flaws in what is often said about ecotaxation and I would very strongly point out that the elements I listed
above need thoroughly examining. As well, we need to do a strong cost-benefit analysis for much of this. For
example, I would say that some of the subsidies for renewables  while my own company is strong on renewables and has a very large solar operation  can be misplaced in terms of the immediate cost and/or
benefit to society. What we are striving for is the transition to a lower carbon economy. We have to recognise
that the use of energy underpins all our societies and therefore that transition has got to made in such a way
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 43
that we do not add such an unacceptable cost to various forms of energy that it has a distortionary effects
that undermine other objectives.
Equally, we are working at the moment on the transition to future technologies and policy  in whatever
shape or form  must understand and align with those. There has been a great deal of divergence on this
point in the past, for example in relation to Kyoto: certainly, the protocol had some strong points in its favour,
but one of the things it was not able to do was to align around where our future options lay. In the past five or
six years, BP and other companies have done a lot of work trying to determine where the future answers to
carbon management and carbon reduction will be. Any future set of policies must understand and relate to
those. If they dont, whatever form a market instrument takes, it cannot actually focus on the objectives required.
Finally, please let me point out that we must always be very clear in designing any form of greenhouse gas
policy using whatever instrument we choose  it must be focussed on carbon, because that's what the problem is. If you misdirect an instrument for some other purpose, then you're not actually achieving the objective
you set out to achieve.
Thank you very much.

LEVY AND AGRE EMENTS ON CORPOR ATE BEHAVIOUR
Introduction
First of all, I would like to make a couple of observations
pertaining to the climate change debate. I have been involved in
environmental economic instruments for twelve years in the UK,
in climate change, waste policy and the costs of compliance with
environmental legislation on business. This combination leads
me to make two observations about ecological taxation in
general.
The first is a positive comment: there is an increasing body of
evidence to show that the expected costs of environmental
legislation are always far higher than the actual costs. Industry is
full of highly intelligent, creative and innovative individuals who
will always find a way to avoid paying taxes and incurring costs.
Even policy makers often cannot foresee the creative ways
businesses come up with to avoid paying a tax or avoid incurring
the costs of environmental legislation.
The second is a more negative comment: there is a policy
dichotomy inherent in the dual purpose of ecotaxes  to drive a
change in behaviour and to raise revenue. Typically, taxes are
levied on inelastic goods and inelastic behaviours and generally, finance departments do not wish to see a
rapid change in behaviour that will suddenly reduce their tax revenues. The London congestion charge is a
prime example of how this dichotomy can hit home  the charge is now losing money, because it was anticipated that revenue from the charge would pay for all the fixed costs incurred for the cameras, software and
technology necessary to control the system, but it has been so effective at dealing with congestion and so
many people have switched to public transport that it runs at a slight deficit.
Nevertheless, there have been several examples of highly successful ecotaxation in the UK. One example is
a tax on waste to landfill, which was split between municipal waste and construction waste. Construction
waste to landfill fell by around 30 percent, because recycling presented a lower cost alternative. Unleaded
petrol taxation had a dramatic effect on changing consumer behaviour. We would like to see ecotaxes driving
changes in behaviour, but for that to happen, there have to be alternatives, otherwise they are just a cost to
business that either impacts on competitiveness or effects consumers. In such cases, it might as well be a
form of VAT or general taxation. For ecotaxes to be effective there must be cost-effective opportunities to afford paying those taxes.
Enviros Experience with the UK Energy Tax System
Firstly, a brief overview of Enviros Consulting: We have a long history of advising on and delivering energy
efficiency in industry and we employ 350 staff with 8 offices throughout the UK and Ireland and also have offices in Spain, the Czech Republic, Canada and South Africa. Our staff comprise engineers, economists, financial experts and MBAs. We employ 60 staff in our energy / climate change practice division and the key
sectors we cooperate with include oil & gas, chemicals, food & drink, glass, cement, brick, packaging, general manufacturing and buildings.
I hope that talking here today will provide a broad overview of the business response to climate change policies in the UK. This is quite a challenge given the diversity of opinion and businesses affected, but our company has been heavily involved in the scheme at a policy level and also in working with business.
The UK climate change levy (CCL) and the climate change agreement (CCA) system have been central to
our work for the past four years. We helped a number of industry sectors negotiate their Climate Change
Agreement (CCA) targets with government in 2000 and we were an active participant in the UK Emissions
Trading Group, chaired by Charles Nicholson, which helped define the detailed rules of the CCA scheme.
We now manage on behalf of industry the CCA activities of 6,000 sites in the food and drink and metal packaging sectors  i.e., we are intimately involved in business decision-making. Of these 6,000 sites, 4,000 are
very small (e.g. chicken houses). We hold training seminars for business on CCA issues and energy management programmes and we have set up a verification scheme so that businesses can verify their emis-
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 45
sions at low cost. Furthermore, since the start of the CCA scheme we have undertaken various reviews for
the UK government on business responses.
Key Features of the UK Energy Tax System
To try to simplify the terminology, the climate change levy was introduced in the UK as a downstream tax on
energy, not necessarily on carbon. It was introduced as a downstream tool for two main reasons. Firstly, so
that one could avoid rapid changes in the energy supply industry. In particular, the government was concerned about coal communities, as they had already been decimated by changes to energy infrastructure.
Social problems caused by more rapid decline in employment in the UKs remaining coalfields would have
been politically unacceptable, and the government wanted to ensure that this didn't happen by producing a
carbon tax. Secondly, the government were concerned about the domestic sector. A tax on upstream energy
inputs would have been automatically passed on to the consumer in the form of higher domestic fuel prices
and the government was very concerned about fuel poverty and the domestic sector, as they estimated that
4 million people were struggling to heat their homes each winter. By targeting a downstream instrument towards business, the government could dictate more accurately who paid the tax and where the burden fell.
The gross effect of the CCL was to increase the costs of energy for business by about 10 to 15 percent, depending on the fuel mix. However, underlying energy prices decreased at the same time as a result of new
trading arrangements in the UK electricity industry due to ongoing liberalisation, which offset the effect of the
climate change levy for business to a large degree. This is not to say that the climate change levy does not
have any beneficial effects  it certainly has as discussed below. In any case, electricity prices have now bottomed out and are increasing again.
There are a number of exemptions from the levy. Good quality combined heat and power, renewable energy
sources and electrolysis are exempt. There were partial exemptions of 80 percent for Energy Intensive Users
through Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) and for some sections of industry, such as commercial greenhouses.

that signed up voluntarily to accept absolute targets for emissions reductions and receive incentive money
from the government in return.
Both of the above groups can trade CO2, so there is a liquid market in CO2 and one of the issues in the UK is
the influence these direct schemes  encompassing 34 companies  have had on providing excess CO2
credits for heavy industrial users that have to comply with these targets. The introduction of emissions reduc-
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 46
tion projects was under discussion at some point, but this has now been superseded by the EU Emissions
Trading Directive.
Key Features of the Climate Change Agreements
Climate change agreements are crucial to the implementation of climate change policy in the UK. Some of
their key features include:
Voluntary participation.
Eligibility for the agreements was not based on an energy intensity criteria, but was based on criteria specified in the integrated pollution prevention and control legislation, the IPCC (but ignoring the
size threshold). This was because the government had to use an existing piece of legislation due to
time constraints. By and large, it was a very good approximation for energy intensive businesses.
Climate change agreements include electricity consumption as well as direct use of fossil fuels.
Targets are in terms of energy efficiency, i.e. they are relative targets. For instance, a target of
kilowatt hours or CO2 per unit of production. Some sectors have nevertheless chosen to take on
absolute targets. Relative targets are far more flexible from a business point of view and one has to
question why any company would take on an absolute target unless it was in their interest.
Targets have to be achieved every two years, in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. They are currently being renegotiated for 2006 (they will be tightened).
Targets are very flexible. Businesses can undertake emissions reduction measures, energy efficiency measures, they can trade CO2 if the price of CO2 is less than the cost of internal reduction
and they also have other risk management measures. Businesses can claim they have changed
e.g. their product mix, have changed the energy intensity of their production process due to market
demand, or they can claim that there has been a force majeur that has rendered their targets more
difficult.
A typical target profile:
Year
2002
2004
2006
2008
2010
% improvement
A 10 percent improvement in efficiency by 2010 was used as a benchmark for the ten year period,
but many industries have much higher targets. Chemicals were given an 18 improvement efficiency
target, cement 26 percent, semi-conductors 59 percent and aluminium 32 percent. These were all
based on detailed negotiations between industry and government.
If a sector passes its target, all its constituent members pass. If a sector fails its target, liability falls
to the individual company / installation. This has created some odd sector behaviour  some sectors comply as a block or pool  but it is unclear why as there is no obvious benefit for participant companies.
Firms long of allowances will not realise their true value  but if long firms want to sell at a discount, why should they sell to their competitors?
Structure of the Climate Change Agreements
We now have 44 umbrella agreements between trade sectors and the government. They cover about 10,700
sites. Of these, 6,700 are quite small  bakeries, supermarkets, etc. Of the remaining 4,000 sites, 2,000 are
in the food and drink industry, leaving 2,000 traditional heavy energy using sites. By any measure, that is a
very comprehensive coverage of agreements between industry and government. In contrast, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) will cover only approximately 1,500 sites in the UK, including the power sector:
while the ETS covers more emissions, CCAs have a far deeper penetration across industry.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 47
The Impact of the Climate Change Levy
Moving on to the question of how effective this legislation has been and how business has responded: any
conclusions we make are based on only a few years of information. For this reason, my comments are based
on personal experience and the limited data that has been published thus far.
Firstly, the climate change levy has actually had very little effect on energy consumption for those businesses paying the full rate. This is for several reasons: firstly, those that pay 100 percent of the climate
change levy are by definition not energy-intensive businesses, or they would have entered into climate
change agreements with the government; secondly, the rate of the levy itself is very low  for those firms liable to pay 100 percent of the levy, 10 to 15 percent is not a material increase to energy prices; and finally,
the levy has been offset by reductions in electricity prices.
The Impact of Climate Change Agreements
If we assume that there are 5,000 firms in climate change agreements, then they cover approximately every
other business in the UK. The climate change agreements had a much greater impact on businesses than
the climate change levy because they effect the main energy using sectors and because businesses have a
very strong incentive to achieve their targets. The climate change levy at its full rate would have had a very
serious financial impact on energy-intensive sectors  millions of pounds would have been incurred in tax.
In 2002, DEFRA calculated that there has been a reduction of 15.8 mt CO2 from baselines and a reduction of
10.4mt CO2 compared to 2002 using base year energy efficiency. If we calculate the foregone tax income of
CCAs at 500 million pounds (assuming 50 percent of the full rate of the levy), then the cost effectiveness of
CCAs = c. 50/tCO2. However, DEFRAs emission reduction figures are likely to be overstated as measures
of real improvements in energy efficiency because baselines were chosen by firms as the worst within a ten
year period (1990  2000) and thus, reductions are not from either the historical average or business as
usual. Also, the calculation of expected energy consumption is simplistic and ignores the beneficial effect of
increasing output. If we assume savings were overstated by factor of 2, cost effectiveness would be around
100/tonne.
Enviros view is that CCAs have had little impact in changing energy consumption of business to date. This
is because targets were originally set generously in favour of business. The negotiation process gave more
cards to the hand of business than to that of government, because business knew very well what their position was in these negotiations, far better than the government did. As a result, 86 percent of participants
passed their first target. Climate change agreements are very flexible, there are opt-outs businesses can use
to reach their targets: risk management measures are quite generous in terms of product mix and output algorithms and thus, economic growth directly benefits business, as increasing output reduces specific energy
consumption. As well, the price of CO2 in the UK trading system has been so low that many companies preferred to buy CO2 than implement measures themselves. This is the problem we have with the direct participation scheme  it created a great many cheap CO2 allowances. Finally, it is difficult to see significant shifts
in energy efficiency over such a short time frame.

The Benefits of Climate Change Agreements to Date
However, although the benefit of the climate change agreements thus far has not been in terms of massive
improvements to energy efficiency, we have seen benefits in other, very important areas. There is much
greater awareness of energy consumption than before these agreements were in place. The UK's largest
supermarket chain, for example, did not know what its energy consumption actually was until two years ago.
The chain had no idea how many kilowatt hours of energy it actually used, just the price it paid. These climate change agreements have forced industry to start measuring how much energy they use. Better data
enables better policy decision-making.
Not only are businesses more aware overall, but the issue of energy consumption is now being raised at a
much higher level. Finance Directors are now aware of the climate change levy  it is not treated like higher
energy costs, perceived as being unavoidable, but as a tax, which can be avoided. There are numerous
consultants and businesses who help business to try and avoid paying these taxes. As well, trade associations meet four times a year and compare and benchmark each other and exchange information on the levy.
This benchmarking helps industry and policy makers.
To summarise, the first two years of the scheme have not yet stimulated a great deal of investment in energy
efficiency because of low CO2 prices and relatively small targets. But this will come and as the tighter targets
start to bite over the next few years, we expect to see real improvements in energy efficiency as well. The
immediate benefits have been in terms of behaviour and awareness and in systems for the measurement of
this. This is the platform from which business can now move forward.
The Business Response to the CCL and CCAs
The chronology of business response to the scheme was as follows: at first, when the climate change levy
was introduced, there was a great deal of opposition from business. They threatened not to pay and claimed
it would put thousands out of work. Whether the apparent severity of the initial policy draft was a bargaining
tactic on the part of the government or not, they certainly succeeded in frightening industry a great deal at
this initial stage. Business then felt it had achieved a great success in negotiating with government to
achieve an 80 percent discount  a considerable shift from having to pay 100 percent of the levy. Then came
the process of negotiating with government and trying to sort out the complexity of these agreements. Business generally felt despondent, negotiations were quite drawn out and everything became rather burdensome.
Now it seems we are moving into a fourth era. Having gone through this negotiation process and having got
the documents signed, business is now feeling relatively comfortable. It knows what it has to do, it can see
the targets stretching out ten years into the future, it is familiar with the CCL system and the efficient trading
system. In short, it seems for business that the worst is behind them and it is starting to settle in to this ecological tax system. What business has in the UK is a flexible system that strikes  as well as possible  a
balance between environmental objectives and the protection of competitiveness and jobs.
Policy Implications
The CCL is still too low to change behaviour in non energy intensive sectors.
CCAs seem to be addressing important aspects of failures in the market for energy efficiency
(awareness, senior level engagement).
The threat of sanctions (full rate of CCL) was key to setting up CCAs.
The high administrative burden was (mostly) necessary  and the UK now has a scheme with
10,700 performance contracts between government and industry.
It is important to pursue policy one step at a time  for a complex scheme, it is best to get the
scheme in place first. Once accepted, targets can then be tightened, taking into account international competitiveness.
Finally, potential areas for future research in the field include: investigating the competitive impacts of energy
and climate change legislation to find the optimal rate of energy/carbon tax; investigating the reasons for certain business responses, such as why businesses choose sub-optimal strategies such as pooling; and investigating when tradable permit schemes really are efficient policy tools, for example, an examination of
whether the EU ETS will actually change business behaviour.

Jan F. Wagner, Environment Daily: Professor Smith, if I understand you correctly, you think the Climate
Change scheme hasnt done what the UK government had said it was supposed to do, because you noted
the problem with determining how much CO2 emissions could have been cut if the tax had been evenly applied.
Stephen Smith, University College London: I wouldnt like to give the impression that I am hostile to the
Climate Change Levy. I think that its a major and significant step forward. The point I was making was that
there are respects that could be improved to improve its environmental performance  more systematic taxation across different fuels, for example. Furthermore, I am particularly sceptical about the effectiveness of
those deals that get companies the 80 percent exemption. Im not sure that these companies did achieve the
80 percent emissions reduction that would have been required had the Climate Change Levy been applied.
But, I do recognise the political difficulties in getting to this point.
Jan F. Wagner, Environment Daily: Why doesnt the UK government have any figures regarding the extent
to which emissions have been cut? In Germany we do have the figures  at least, we are able to say that the
ecotax scheme is having a particular effect and to quantify it.
Stephen Smith, University College London: Well, you can measure emissions and you can say how
theyve changed, but the critical thing is to say whether that is the result of the measures that have been implemented and if so, which components of the measures. That is actually quite a difficult evaluation and the
UK government has certainly worked on that topic and there may be things that they could say. The fundamental question of evaluating impacts is actually rather difficult.
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting: The effectiveness of the agreements is difficult to measure  you cant
just look at trends in energy consumption or CO2 over time, you have to compare it to some measure of what
would have happened if business had continued as usual. That is really quite a complex equation, which
takes into account base load energy consumption through to site-product mix and a range of other independent variables that enable you to calculate expected energy consumption. More recent research the government has done examines this in a lot more detail and has tried to look at this business as usual case and
identify departures from that.
Marie Pender, DEFRA: I would like to point out that climate change agreement targets are not just hot air 
negotiations were not easy and I think the government got the best deal they could at the time, in view of the
situation, which was negotiating something no government had ever negotiated before.
With reference to the effect of voluntary agreements: Econometric analysis at the time revealed that the top
10 energy consuming sectors paying the full rate of the levy would have achieved 0.25 million tonnes of carbon. The targets in the agreements amount to 2.5 million tonnes of carbon  thats ten times as much. Industry is not simply responding to a price incentive  to keep its money in its pocket and not to pay it to government, industry has had to take action, and so it has.
I understand from an independent consultant that the effect on energy consumption in these sectors is quite
apparent in changes between 2001 and 2003.
The Marshall report that precursed the introduction of the levy and the agreements pointed out that energyintensive industry could not pay 100 percent of the levy. Therefore, if you are suggesting that they should
have paid 100 percent of the levy, one can only presume that the rate of the levy would have had to have
been very much lower.
I am currently conducting a review of target achievement based on the evidence we have from industry. The
government too was very sceptical that industry in general exceeded their targets by such a large amount
and believed that this could not be the result of heavy investment over such a short time period. In fact, the
sectors I have spoken to so far are bringing forward evidence of substantial, multi-million pound investment
to have achieved what they have so far. They are claiming that this is early action, that their finance directors
are advising to take action immediately rather than wait until later. Obviously, the government is demanding
hard evidence that this has been the case  but if it has been the case, we are not intending to penalise this
early action because it has been good for the environment.
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting: This kind of instrument can never achieve everything in the first year.
These things take a long time. The emphasis needs to be to get the instrument in place, get industry on
board and then the rest is relatively easy. Once the instrument is in place, it can be fine-tuned to achieve optimal levels of tax or targets that are acceptable to industry and achieve environmental improvements.

Stephen Smith, University College London: In designing practical policy it is important to remember that
the best can be the enemy of the good. As Marie Pender from DEFRA pointed out, it would have been extremely difficult to introduce a climate change levy applied uniformly to all sectors at the tax rate we actually
achieved. The levy would have met with much more opposition and implementation might have become unfeasible. I quite accept that there is a complicated process involved in generating a policy outcome.
I believe that what we have got is good  it may not be the best and it may be that there are improvements
we can make  but I'm certainly impressed by the progress that has been made.
Charles Nicholson, Senior Policy Advisor, BP: Certainly when we were devising the UK trading system
some of our UK government colleagues who were involved said that they wished that they had never gone
down the road of the Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements, and how much simpler it
would have been to go straight for a trading system. But we do have a Climate Change Levy and Agreements, and I think the points that have been made echo what could be said about the trading system. It is
early days. If you try and get substantial results too quickly, you won't succeed, because you will just cause
people to resist you. Once you get people to start this process of awareness creating and learning by doing,
then you can start turning up the volume  and that will happen within the trading system.
Of course, it is possible to argue about whether the trading system delivered more than would have happened anyway. The UK national audit office has just done a study on that and the answer is yes and no. But
at least there is an instrument now, people are committed to it, and it will develop. It is much better to go
through this kind of process than to be like boxers in a ring who only meet to deliver each other blows.

TAX RELIEF FOR ENERGY-INTENSIVE BUSINESS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ECOLOGIC AL TAX
REFORM AND THE CLIMATE CHANGE LEVY
Introduction
I am going to discuss special provisions for business  in my opinion, one of the most difficult issues in the
ecotax debate. As time is short, I've tried to set some priorities and I wont go into great detail, but will try to
give you a rough idea of the ecotax reform in Germany. I intend to focus on Germany, because I have discovered that it is very difficult to say something about policies in other countries when you have not been
closely involved in the debate. I will try to give you an economist's view on how one should approach the issue of special provisions for energy-intensive business.
My presentation is structured as follows: first of all, I will give you a brief overview of ecological tax reform in
Germany; then I will try to define special provisions, or tax concessions, or whatever you like to call them;
then I will look at some of the motives, criteria, and constraints for such provisions; and finally, I will look at
tax concessions as they have been designed in Germany and the UK and try to give you some perspectives
on the debate in Germany.
Ecological Tax Reform in Germany
Germany embarked on their ecological tax reform in 1999. It was supposed to be a revenue neutral tax reform, i.e. a tax reform consisting of two components: on the one hand, an increase in energy taxation, on the
other hand, revenue recycling by means of reductions in social security contributions amounting to approximately the same volume. The energy taxation consisted of an increase in taxes on petroleum products and a
new tax on electricity, incorporating special provisions for energy-intensive production  what I will focus on
today. The additional revenue raised by the tax amounts to about 18.6 billion.

Special Provisions: Definitions and Motives
It is very hard to find a general definition of special provisions, so I
will try to give you an impression of the economic flavour of them.
As Stephen Smith said this morning, economic theory states that
uniform taxes are an efficient way to induce a reduction of energy
use or emissions. This is the point of reference we are starting
from. But there are deviations from uniform taxation  and these
deviations are what I want to consider in the most general sense
as special provisions. Such tax differentiation takes place on
several different levels: for example, there is tax differentiation on
the level of energy carriers, between different users of energy and
different usage of energy.
What are the motivations underlying special provisions? The main
motive seems to be fears that these taxes may have adverse
effects. On the one hand, these effects may be economic: there is
the issue of international competitiveness, the fear that there may
be a premature retirement of capital  physical as well as human
 and the fear that there may be unacceptable distributive effects.
But there are also environmental concerns, that these taxes may lead to what is called carbon leakage  the
relocation of production away from the country where taxation is increased to other countries, which may
partially offset or even overcompensate for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the country itself. However,
because the environmental problem we are facing is global, it does not make sense to undertake unilateral
measures against carbon leakage in the long run  even within the framework of international agreements
such as Kyoto, individual countries are required to reduce domestic emissions and, as relocation of production is treated in the same way as an increase in energy efficiency or fuel switching, countries are likely to fulfil this obligation in the cheapest way possible, even if this implies carbon leakage. For this reason, managing
structural change seems to be the only valid cause for special provisions in the long term.
What it generally seems to boil down to, however, is political acceptance. Politicians seem to believe that
without some kind of special provisions, it will not be possible to introduce environmental taxes.
Special Provisions: Constraints and Criteria
Primarily, as I already mentioned, special provisions aim to avoid negative economic effects and to avoid
carbon leakage. But the issue is more complex: the incentive effect of an ecotax must be preserved, because if it is not, we do not need to introduce an ecotax at all. There are also legal constraints on national,
European and international levels, e.g. world trade organisation law. There are administrative constraints:
special provisions should not be so expensive and time-consuming that business has good reason to complain. On the other hand  and this is a point that economists very much stress  ecotaxes are supposed to
be market-based instruments: special provisions contain an inherent risk of discretionary decision-making,
meaning that it is not the market which rules the process, but the decision-making of bureaucrats.
These are conflicting objectives and therefore, some kind of process of weighing up is necessary. For this
reason, we will never find one clear answer or one right type or way to have special provisions. Different
countries decide this in different ways and there are good reasons for whatever countries decide to do  the
most important thing is that countries are aware of why they are doing what they are doing.
Demarcation of Beneficiaries
One of the most important questions which has to be addressed when you want to introduce special provisions is who is to profit from these special provisions. One of the issues where these criteria have to be
taken into consideration is that the more precise the demarcation of the beneficiaries  the more precisely
you define those enterprises subject to international competition and unable to pay for this tax  the more information is necessary. The more precisely you are able to identify such companies, the less the loss of associated incentives and tax revenues will be. But at the same time, there is a risk that precise definition may
result in administrative procedures becoming so complicated and subject to lobbying that the system becomes unacceptable from the point of view of an economist.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 53
My conviction is that in the long run, we need environmental taxes as a market-based instrument  and if we
are on our way to a sustainable market economy, then we should try to avoid discretionary decisions in the
context of special provisions as far as possible.
Special Provisions in Germany
In Germany, broadly speaking, special provisions have two main characteristics: they do not apply to road
fuels, and they are based on a broad and rules-based system. Germany has tax rates differentiated by energy carriers, reduced rates for broad-based categories of business or industry, and firm-specific tax rebates.
With reference to tax rates differentiated by energy carriers  in Germany there is no tax on coal, which is
basically due to the fact that industries that use coal are very often energy-intensive industries subject to international competition. There is also a huge difference between taxation on diesel fuel and gasoline, which
has always been justified by the fact that road transport, freight transport, is in international competition.
Thus, differentiating tax rates on energy carriers is one way of protecting certain kinds of business.
Three Options for Special Provisions
I will now discuss three options for implementing special provisions which have been discussed or implemented in Germany at different points in time. The first is a draft law that has never been implemented. This
law stated that there should be reduced rates of 25 percent of regular tax rates for all producers of the goods
and materials sector (i.e., manufacturing industry, energy/water, mining and the construction sector) as well
as agriculture, forestry and fishery, and that there should be tax exemptions for producers belonging to energy-intensive sectors  where energy intensity was defined at a rate of more than 2 percent.
This proposal has been heavily criticised. One of the reasons was that energy intensity itself is an inappropriate indicator of the burden resulting from energy taxes. Take the case of an industry that mainly uses coal:
they might have a high energy intensity but a low energy tax burden, because there is no tax on coal. Another criticism was that statistical categories imply unequal treatment. That is, broad statistical categories
cannot tell you what the specific activities are within these broad categories. Furthermore, there is a net reduction of the tax burden for energy-intensive industries  on the one hand, they don't pay energy taxes and
on the other, they profit from a reduction in social security contributions. So there might be what economists
refer to as a perverse incentive effect  that these industries are given an incentive to growth because of
their reduced tax burden.
In response to these criticisms, a revised proposal was drawn up, which was actually implemented in 1999
and was enforced until the end of 2002. This incorporated a reduced tax rate of 20 percent of the regular rate
for all producers in the goods and materials sector and then, individual compensation for all tax payments
that exceeded the reduction of pension contributions by more than 20 percent  i.e., there was a tax cap.
How does this compare to what we had before? Firstly, there is no perverse incentive effect. Individual company data is used and not statistical categories for tax rebates. But still, there is a restriction to the goods and
materials sector which may imply unequal treatment and in fact, this issue was brought before the German
constitutional court, which ruled that this unequal treatment was not unconstitutional.
Furthermore, this ecotax does not create an incentive to improve energy efficiency for energy-intensive enterprises: once these industries are above the threshold, increasing their energy intensity or even reducing it
will not change their tax burden. However, this regulation was changed in 2003. Whereas the reduced tax
rate was previously 20 percent of the regular rate, this has been increased to 60 percent of the regular rate
for all producers in the goods and materials sector. It was argued that this was possible because companies
had had a couple of years to adjust to the new tax regime. The tax cap system was also changed and now,
tax rebates are 95 percent of the tax payments which exceed the reduction of pension contributions. This
means that there is at least a slight incentive for energy-intensive industries to reduce their energy intensity,
but they nevertheless pay in effect only 3 percent of the regular tax rate.
Thus, if we compare the two structures, we can say that the incentive effect is higher for some enterprises
and lower for others. The net effect on energy use is thus ambiguous. However, the average tax burden is
higher for most enterprises and there is a positive revenue effect. I personally have been quite critical of the
reform of these special provisions, because I think there is a certain danger that revenue raising may start to
dominate environmental objectives. It might be that the finance minister gets used to having the extra money,
but doesn't really care about the environment enough.

Special Provisions and the Climate Change Levy
I do not wish to discuss the Climate Change Levy as a whole, but to look at some of its special provisions
compared to what we have seen in Germany. In the UK, there are some tax exemptions and there are two
important points in this context. The first one is there is a general exemption for electricity used in electrolysis
processes, such as aluminium smelting, and chloro-alkali processes. This means that from the first, some of
the most energy-intensive processes in industry are exempt from taxation. The other thing that is important in
this context is the 80 percent tax reduction granted to energy-intensive sectors. Again, this exemption is
based on a broad statistical definition, which I criticised in the German context. On the other hand, this exemption is only granted to enterprises or sectors covered by Climate Change Agreements. This is an important point, because what I think it shows is that what Germany did was surrender the idea of providing a
strong incentive effect through ecological tax reform. In the UK, only those companies prepared to enter into
a Climate Change Agreement with the government were granted this tax reduction.
Climate Change Agreements are also a very difficult issue, however, and Stephen Smith and others already
mentioned what the problems might be (see above). It means that the government has to negotiate these
agreements with sectors and enterprises, that government is supposed to know to what extent an enterprise
is able to reduce its energy use and to what extent an enterprise is subject to international competition.
In this respect, the UK and Germany drew on two different models for their special provisions  on the one
hand, the German model acknowledges that we probably cannot create that much of an incentive effect in
the case of energy-intensive industries. On the other hand, the UK system still wishes to create this incentive
effect by means of negotiating agreements and it is these agreements, their associated administrative costs,
the time-consuming nature of the process and the quality of this process which will decide in the end whether
we reach our targets or not.
Perspectives for Germany
Let's move on to some perspectives for the German ecological tax reform in the future and what this might
mean for special provisions. Ecological tax reform in Germany will be reviewed in 2004 and one of the most
important questions will be whether Germany should continue with the ecological tax reform  and in my
opinion, Germany certainly should, even if we do have emissions trading. This is because we only have partial emissions trading  only large installations are covered by emissions trading and we do need incentives
in other areas as well  especially transportation and private households. Furthermore, I think the idea of the
double dividend, reducing labour costs with ecotax revenue, is sensible and has a strong basis in economic
theory. If you want to reduce energy consumption and you can do so and raise revenue at the same time,
basically all research shows that this is a good thing to do, because it helps you to raise revenue without
causing distortions in the system.
Should the emissions trading sector be exempt from the energy tax, or the ecological tax reform in this case?
Well, no, I don't think so. This sector also profits from the reduction in social security contributions and thus,
as long as emissions certificates are issued for free, I think this sector necessarily has to contribute to the financing of the reduction of these social security contributions.
What does this mean? It means that the issue of special provisions and how to design them will not go away.
The bad thing about this  I have not seen any good, convincing answers to this issue. This may be bad
news, or it may be good news for the researchers who will have a look at this issue in the future.

FUELS,
THE ECOTAX REFORM IN GERM ANY  THE VIEW OF THE GERM AN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
I would like to do three things. Firstly, give you an insight into how the automobile industry works and functions; secondly, to show how this effects customers; and finally, to focus on the ecological tax reform itself.
The Automotive Industry Today
First of all, the automotive industry does not provide its own fuel  it simply designs and builds vehicles and
sells them in the hope that sufficient fuel is available to run them. The chart below shows that the oil industry
will obtain maximum production in around 2006 and after that, crude oil extraction rates will gradually decrease over time. We can already safely predict that oil prices will rise during this period  but it is too early
to tell whether these prices increases will be gradual or not. Extraction of North Sea oil already peaked in
mid-2001 and has been decreasing ever since.
THE SITUATION  CRUDE OIL RESOURCES
Since mid-2001, North sea oil
production has been decreasing
There is considerable uncertainty regarding how long crude oil resources will really last. Different sources
provide different forecasts  from 60 to 160 years  for example because the East Asian states are rapidly
industrialising and motorising, particularly the Chinese economy which itself encompasses 1.3 billion people
and are likely to claim an increasing share of crude oil resources in the future.
Obviously, the automotive industry is very much aware of this uncertain situation, just as they know that increasing traffic and industrial site concentrations causes more noise and more emissions that have a detrimental effect, particularly on urban areas. Thus, the vehicle industry has set out to create the strategy of
sustainable mobility  for the simple reason that they want to continue to build and sell vehicles.
Sustainable mobility in their sense comprises almost every aspect of vehicles: fuel consumption, exhaust
emissions, production process efficiency, affordability. But changes are done in line with customer demands
and their broad spectrum of wants and needs. So changes appear to be slow  and one might suspect that
there are other reasons for the automobile industry to behave in this way.
In the West, the demand for mobility is saturated  there are no new additional customers available. If sales
increase, they are conquest sales. Production capacity has exceeded demand by approximately 20 percent
for many years. This has led to more competitive action and depressed margins. To lower the total cost bill
and regain sufficient margins, OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) have reduced their costs by effec-
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 56
tively outsourcing research and development of components and even modules to their suppliers. The result
was that technology has also become available to new competitors in low-cost countries, e.g. Daewoo,
Hyundai, and others, because suppliers in turn sold the technology and products to as many customers as
possible in order to minimize their rising research and development costs. This has enabled the low cost
country based OEMs to manufacture and sell vehicles at a sufficiently good quality and durability at considerably lower prices and hence this has led to further a margin depression. The result is that now, any investment in research, development or in new plants must be amortised within ever shorter time spans, and the
timing of this has once more become crucial for the profitability of the investments. In short, the OEMs do
not have funds available for deadlock investments that do not turn into mass products.
In conclusion, the automobile industry has exceeded its cyclic maximum: it is a ripe industry.
Customer Demands
Generally, consumers focus on three things. They want vehicles that are more roomy and more powerful and
hence, bigger van-type cars have become increasingly popular, requiring engines with more power which
usually consume more fuel than before. Consumers also want a greater degree of comfort in their vehicles.
Thus, more vehicles than ever have electrically powered windows and door-locking systems, air conditioning,
power-assisted steering and even on-board TV and video. As a result, vehicle weight and size has increased, undermining the positive effects of improvements to the fuel efficiency of vehicle engines and reductions in exhaust gas emissions.
The effect of German and European legislation
Legislation has forced vehicle manufacturers to do a lot to reduce
harmful exhaust gas emissions, e.g. to add catalytic converters and
particulate filters to their vehicles  new, costly parts  and to
comply with more complex test procedures. Furthermore, legislation
has stipulated improved passenger and incident security, which has
meant increasing the number of crash tests, the installation of air
bags, etc. Stipulations for noise reduction have led to the
development of low noise tyres and new engine and body
dampening materials, which have also made vehicles much heavier
than before.
As well, the ecological tax reform has been introduced to address
CO2 issues. The ecotax has focussed the consumer and OEMs on
the issue of CO2 emission-reduced mobility, which has prompted
fuel and cost efficiency improvements. The ecotax also led to the
shift from petrol to diesel engines for the customers tried to lower
their fuel bill. The fiscal support of alternative fuels, particularly CNG
(compressed natural gas) has led to a CNG fuel pricing in Germany at about half the price of petrol and 65
percent of diesel. This fuel taxation measure has been extended until the end of 2020  and hence, has
shifted the focus of the OEMs to alternative fuels with more force than anybody expected.
Let us take Ford as an example. Ford produce vehicles that run on almost all kinds of alternative fuel: they
are researching FCV (fuel cell vehicles)/hydrogen engines and hybrid alternative fuel concepts and today,
they already have ethanol, natural gas, and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) vehicles. Notably, the latter were
especially developed for the congestion charge in London  a clear example of research and development
as a reaction to government policy. Other companies are also taking action: BMW are developing hydrogenreciprocating engines for the future; DaimlerChrysler already have natural gas vehicles and are working towards producing FCVs; Opel/General Motors produce natural gas vehicles and are developing
FCVs/hydrogen engines; finally, VW also have natural gas vehicles and are researching synthetic-fuel generation, so called Syn-fuel (methane/natural gas-based) and sun-fuel concepts (biomass-based).
The View of German OEMs today
Investments in research and development or new production facilities are extremely expensive  building
one new vehicle with one new engine costs  including R&D and tooling  approximately 1 billion euros or
dollars. Therefore, OEMs have some issues with doing something that is not immediately necessary, particularly within the current competitive environment, which forces mass production to achieve viability.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 57
OEMs in Germany more or less regard governmental regulations as a risk to their competitiveness, particularly as here in Germany more than 70 percent of vehicles and automobile products are exported and every
seventh job in Germany still depends on the vehicle industry. Self-commitments like the ACEA CO2 commitment represent the strategy the automotive industry would prefer, particularly in lieu of prematured governmental regulations. The automotive industry will certainly ask for government support in the future for the
research, development and launching of new alternative fuels at the move away from our current crude oil
based fuels.
Conclusions and Recommendations
In conclusion, OEMs do not actively support governmental actions like the ecotax reform, but they watch
them and they react to them  and this is an achievement in itself.
The depressed margins of the automotive industry need to be carefully considered when further measures
are introduced to avoid production transfer to other countries.
European coordination and the synchronisation of the implementation of measures is a prerequisite for the
acceptability of ecological tax reforms. When future actions are implemented, they should be developed
jointly by all the market partners involved and well in advance of their planned implementation.

1 Introduction
In this presentation I would like to focus on:
eco-taxes & their alternatives  a personal perspective
introducing an astounding market deficit
and its grand solution, energy-transparency
2 Prices Do Matter
First of all, I strongly believe that prices do matter. For this reason, we should never align prices in the market against our societal goals, be they environmental  e.g. the consumption of energies that are environmentally relevant  or otherwise. The following diagram exemplifies this argument.
GASOLINE PRICES

PER C APIT A G ASOLINE CONSUMPTION
So prices do matter  and as we do influence and change prices in any case, we should be conscious of the
necessity of not changing prices in a way that will hinder the achievement of our goals.

3 Guessing Real Instrument Costs
In the following diagram I have attempted to depict my best estimate of the real costs of alternative instruments for achieving CO2 abatement goals per unit of climate benefit.
RE AL INSTRUMENT COSTS
RELATION
CLIM ATE BENEFIT
Regulation has a high cost associated with it per tonne of CO2 abated as a result. The spread of these costs
does not depend particularly much on the regulatory system, i.e. it does not vary that much.
Emissions trading schemes have a much larger spread of costs. Based in particular on my experience in
South America, I believe that their cost can be much higher than that of regulation  if a trading scheme is
implemented poorly or in the wrong arena. However, in ideal settings it can also be considerably lower than
in the case of regulation. The costs of implementing emissions trading throughout the EU are much higher
than many people would estimate, also due to the large number of service providers  consultants, lawyers 
which have sprung up as a result of the policy. The amount of money that is actually invested in CO2 abatement is relatively small.
The CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and JI (Joint Investment) projects also tend to involve similar
elevated hidden costs.
The costs of C.A.F.E. (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) per unit of climate benefit, which establishes standards for passenger cars and light trucks in the USA and which apply on a fleet-wide basis for all vehicle
manufacturers, are absolutely horrendous. The implementation of this policy has even resulted in counterproductive developments.
In contrast, ecotaxes, even if they are poorly implemented, do not reach the cost levels per unit of benefit
that characterize the other instruments. However, the political cost of ecotaxes is probably the highest: Their
effect of increasing certain prices is "too transparent" (although it is precisely this transparency that makes
eco-taxes so powerful, effective and efficient). Thus, for politicians, there is very little to be gained by the implementation of ecotaxes. Ecotaxes will continue to face a great deal of resistance, but the ratio of climate
benefit per unit of political effort is probably still the best if we continue favouring ecotaxes over other instruments.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 60
4 An Astonishing Market-Deficit
There may be a means of resolving the political cost associated with the introduction of ecotaxes. What I refer to as an astonishing market deficit can be best characterised by multi-billion-spending on relatively small
environmental improvements (e.g.: investment in the car industry, exhaust emissions) while the enormous
and economically viable conservation potentials in the consumption of energy, water, etc. remain almost untouched and ignored by companies and other large organisations  and have been for decades.
For example, DaimlerChrysler has an annual electricity bill of some 500 million euro. The company employs
hundreds of people dedicated to lowering these costs and professionals agree that the economically viable
potential savings are probably in the region of 20 percent  at least  which would mean savings of 100 million euro per annum. For any enterprise, savings of this magnitude are extremely interesting. Nevertheless,
these saving potentials have not yet been realised.
Of course, this raises the question of whether ecotaxes and prices are the wrong mechanism. In my opinion,
while they are the best mechanism in principle, what happens in practice is that these price incentives do not
reach the relevant actors in key segments of the economy. The relevant actors in relation to energy use
within a large company are not primarily the energy experts, but employees at large, top management and
purchase departments  who do not know anything about energy, who do not know what a kilowatt hour
really is. Thus we can identify an information gap, a communication problem  and a market deficit.
5 The Problem
Primarily, the problem rests on the fact that actual measurements of energy consumption are far too scarce 
they do not occur often enough to enable us to implement user-pays principles or similar measures  and
they are too centralised as well.
Cost centres, for example, pay their energy bills based on square metres, in a socialised manner, but this
does not bear any relation to the energy they actually consume, to a user-pays principle. Purchase departments consider the sticker price of an investment and not its long-term cost aspects, which for most buildings
and production facilities, machines, etc. is much higher than the sticker price. Moreover, facility managers
usually feel no real incentive to conserve energy for their clients  it is not part of their contract, for the simple
reason that energy use is currently not measured enough to be worked into such contracts.
In short, energy-cost related transparency and incentive systems are particularly lacking at the lowest levels
of large organisations.
6 "Radical Energy Transparency"
Having researched this topic while working at Daimler-Chrysler, I founded a new company, the dezem
GmbH in February 2003. Radical energy transparency is the companys goal  and to create a new quality in
energy conservation. I had many opportunities to identify the clear necessity for this kind of transparency and
how to do it, to make it palatable to the actors I want to address, to our target groups. Large conservation potentials abound in the distributed consumption of energy, conservation potentials of 20 or even 50 percent.
Yet surprisingly little is being done.
Dezems three theses are: firstly, that conservation options and success monitoring must be made extremely
easy to understand for top management and everyone else involved, because you cannot expect top managers to know about energy issues; secondly, technical and behaviour-based measures are equally important, because behaviour-based measures are necessary to transmit information on energy conservation to
lower levels of an organisation; and thirdly and most importantly, this message must reach target groups
emotionally.
7 DEZEMs Contribution: Transparency
Dezem contributes technologies for monitoring en masse  we develop hardware modules that do this at low
cost.
 We provide easy-to-use transparency for professionals, top management and unskilled workers:
detailed/relevant/real-time/mouse-click information in money terms  not in physical terms only.
This information is all available on the intranet, so that every worker has full and easy access from
their own workstation.

Clear-cut success-monitoring for all activities.
New services based on complete energy and cost transparency.
Development of incentive systems and stories for the emotional component in implementing reductions in the cost of energy, water, etc.
8 The Need for and Implementation of Energy Conservation Measures
The base-level energy consumption of a typical office building amounts to more than 50 percent of its total
consumption overall. This 50 percent is almost completely unnecessary. Dezem currently has some 65 large
office buildings online in their energy consumption and in no case has base consumption been less than 50
percent of the total before starting each project. This is something that everyone can understand immediately: there is a great deal of potential here and not only to save 3 or 4 percent, but to save much more.
It is possible to reduce the energy consumption of an office building by 50 percent within one year. Dezem
makes detailed measurements of consumption to enable the immediate identification of concrete saving options. For example, when floor lighting in an office building has been reduced by 57 percent based on a simple measure, we can relate this measure to the actual costs saved. This enables us to estimate amortisation
times accurately.
Even peanuts matter: Installing movement sensors in the toilet lighting on one of our clients office buildings
saved 160 euros per pair of toilets. As the client has some 1,000 toilets, they are now able to save 160,000
euros per annum just as a result of this simple measure. It was important, however, to make employees understand the idea behind the measure first.
9 Dezems Usual Project Steps
Step one:
visualisation of the consumption patterns of the clients office buildings or production facilities on
one attractive platform and in real time, via either internet or intranet.
ranking and benchmarking of those facilities, based on those online-measurements, according to
simple criteria.
Step two:
inserting more measurement points to create greater transparency reflecting the needs arisen from
the above ranking: building sections, machines and  if necessary  down to the individual wall outlet; all on the same platform.
Step three:
development of incentive systems to ensure the involvement of all relevant groups and actors.
10 Conclusion
Emotionally attractive energy transparency:
is able to resolve the above
market-deficit and as such it is a
catalyst to lower the political cost
of ecotaxes
bridges the gap between savingpotentials and actual success
brings life into the issue
makes energy costs a matter of
choice
Thus, smart energy transparency should lower the political cost of ecotaxes and catalyse progress toward
climate protection, because people are thus empowered to tackle the issue. In all probability, companies will
be able to lower the base of what produces the cost far more rapidly than the tax will increase, and thus, improved energy transparency can catalyse a great deal of progress towards climate protection.

SESSION 3, ECOLOGIC AL TAX ATION
Page 62
GERM ANY, DISCUSSION
Kai Schlegelmilch, Green Budget Germany, Moderator: One comment: in relation to energy conservation
at a macro-level, for the first time since the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany back in 1949,
transport fuel sales have fallen for 4 consecutive years  which is at least partly attributable to the ecological
tax reform. As well, sales of 3 and 5 litre cars have increased considerably, and the number of passengers
using public transport have also increased steadily over the last five years.
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting: A question to Michael Kohlhaas  is draft law 3 of the ecotax reform currently implemented? And if so, what is the net impact for industry in terms of industrial energy prices  I didnt
understand the level of tax that businesses are going to be paying under that law. In the UK it was an increase of 10-15 percent and I would be interested to hear a comparable figure.
Michael Kohlhaas, DIW: Draft 3 is currently in force. As to your second question, I do not have the comparable figures.
Helmut Jansen, German Finance Ministry: Mr. Kohlhaas, Dr. Dbel  you said that lower tax on diesel
was to protect the transport sector, but this is incorrect  the main reason was to support the development of
modern diesel technology. Moreover, diesel passenger vehicles have increased over the last few years; in
this context, what do you think of having the same taxation levels for diesel, as in the UK, or even higher
rates for diesel, as in Switzerland?
Franz-Martin Dbel, Managing Director of the Institute for Market Creation for Alternative Fuels: First
and foremost, it is necessary to differentiate between cars and HGVs in this context: the increase of diesel
engine sales has particularly taken place in the car sector because lorries, vans, etc. have operated on diesel for longer. The ecotax may have initiated more research and dedication to the efficiency of the diesel
process. Emotionally at least, the impression consumers had was that they needed to find ways to reduce
the operating costs of their vehicles and for this reason, they came to focus upon diesel engines. The taxation of diesel engines is more costly than that of petrol engines, but this did not compensate for the apparent
fuel cost reduction on diesel. For this reason, the demand for diesel engines has increased.
Helmut Jansen, German Finance Ministry: My main question was: what would you expect from the same
taxation rates for diesel and petrol as in the UK, or perhaps a higher taxation level on diesel, as in Switzerland?
Franz-Martin Dbel, Managing Director of the Institute for Market Creation for Alternative Fuels: A
diesel engine is somewhat more expensive in terms of injection equipment than a petrol engine  so diesels
are more costly than petrol vehicles. So if taxation rates on petrol and diesel were the same, then the number of diesel cars would fall once more, particularly in
view of legislation that stipulates that passenger cars
must have particulate filters, which increases all cars
prices by 500 Euros. That would revert the trend back to
petrol, or otto cycle engines.
Michael Kohlhaas, German Institute for Economic
Research: We might in fact see such a development now
that the EU Directive on energy tax harmonisation
permits differentiation between diesel tax on commercial
and private vehicles. Some countries might move in this
direction. I anticipate exactly the same thing as Dr. Dbel.
Diesel has always been attractive for car-users who drive
long distances. Maybe this was another implicit motive for
reducing the tax rate on diesel, to make long distance car
travel cheaper.
Michael Kohlhaas (left) and Franz-Martin Dbel
Kai Schlegelmilch, Green Budget Germany, Moderator: The European Commission might also pick up on
the proposal they once made on real harmonisation in the haulier sector, to introduce a uniform diesel taxation rate throughout the EU. However, although this proposal is on the agenda, it has not been discussed for
the past one and a half years. This would represent true harmonisation, if only for the haulier sector.
Georg Riegel, founder of dezem GmbH: A question for Michael Kohlhaas  are you aware of a study that
looks at the hidden costs of these instruments? Obviously there are different amounts of hidden costs associated with each kind of instrument, and these costs are differently spread. When I prepared this presentation, I thought about research in this direction.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 63
Michael Kohlhaas, German Institute for Economic Research: I dont think there has been a systematic
study on this. There have been studies on for example, transaction costs and administrative costs of emissions trading and taxation, and some on regulation as well, but not a systematic comparative study as far as
I know.
Kai Schlegelmilch, Green Budget Germany, Moderator: The administrative costs for the ecotax reform is
0.13 percent points of the total revenues it raises. This is far lower than for other taxes, even taking special
regulations and exemptions into account.
Eva Kraav, Estonian Ministry of the Environment: As in Germany, the EU Energy Taxation Directive
taxes energy production as an output tax, but this means that it does not matter what kind of fuel is used to
produce electricity. Where is the environmental protection in such a measure?
Secondly, when only output tax is levied, how can consumers choose electricity that is more environmentally
friendly?
Michael Kohlhaas, German Institute for Economic Research: I think there is one main reason for the
construction of the tax as a final energy tax. If you have a primary energy tax or an emissions tax, you tax the
inputs but not the electricity. If Germany were to implement input tax, then electricity imports from other
countries without a comparable tax would be far cheaper than electricity produced in Germany. Because the
EU does not permit differentiation between electricity from Germany and imported electricity, an output energy tax was introduced for legal and technical reasons. Of course, this does cause problems because it is
impossible to distinguish between different energy inputs and there is no incentive to increase energy efficiency in power generation. As for consumer choice: in Germany today, many companies state which energy
sources have been used to produce their electricity - so there is some degree of choice. Some producers
give consumers the choice between different tariffs according to the structure of the energy supplied.
Eva Kraav, Estonian Ministry of the Environment: Your environment ministers should make a great deal
more effort to advertise these better sources of energy and better energy producers. I think there are some
differences in the new EU member states in this respect: in Estonia, for example, we have a monopoly and
our producers are very much interested in this tax rather than a charge, because this tax will hit consumers
and not the producers themselves.
Kai Schlegelmilch, Green Budget Germany, Moderator: There is some advertising for green electricity in
Germany, but actually the most effective instrument in favour of green electricity generation is the Renewable Energy Act, which provides feed-in tariffs for companies that generate electricity from renewables,
which receive a guaranteed electricity price for twenty years. This is a perfect investment situation  having
such long-term security. This is how we favour green electricity.
Turning to the issue of input taxation for electricity generation again  in Germany we only tax natural gas,
which is a relatively clean fossil fuel, whereas we do not tax coal or uranium. This actually hinders the development of CCGTs  very efficient Combined Cycle Gas Turbines  on the German market. We are about to
phase out this anomaly, because in the EU Energy Tax Directive, Germany is obliged to completely phase
out the energy tax for gas electricity generation. We hope to create a level playing field in the future.
Dr. Ulrike Beland, DIHK  German Association of Industry and Trade Chambers: Georg Riegel  I
found the slide on the estimated costs of instruments very interesting and for me it was astonishing, as I
would have thought that an emissions trading system is much cheaper to administer than an ecotax system.
May I remind you of what our British colleagues have already stated, namely, that the administration of the
British ecotax system is quite complicated. The German system is as well, in my opinion. I do not think one
can be overly proud of having low administrative costs for the ecological tax in Germany, since these costs
are borne by business. The German ecotax is so complicated that businesses do not understand how to apply for special purpose tax rebates and, as is always the case for indirect taxes, the administration costs fall
on businesses themselves. The only administration undertaken by the government is controlling the taxation
paid. In short, I doubt very much that what is calculated as administration costs is the true figure.
Kai Schlegelmilch, Green Budget Germany, Moderator: As I said, these administration costs only refer to
the public sector  but I would be interested to receive the figures for the administration costs for the business sector as well.
Martin Bursk, Ecoconsulting GmbH, formerly Environment Minister of the Czech Republic: With reference to taxation on the input of electricity production. Germany is going to review its ecological tax reform
and I think the situation has changed in relation to 1998 when the reform began, in at least two respects.
First of all, in the new Electricity directive 2003/54/EC on opening the internal electricity market, suppliers
will be obliged to provide final consumers with information regarding the origins of all types of electricity. This
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 64
requirement must be introduced into national legislation. Secondly, Council Directive 2003/96/EC on environmental tax reform permits tax to be levied on primary energy sources and on electricity as its output.
These are two new inputs from European legislation which might initiate changes while negotiating new
steps in the German reform.
For your interest: The Czech Republic has put environmental tax reform on its governmental program and
we plan to introduce the first measures in 2007 and to introduce full taxes in 2008. The main debate will focus on if and how to differentiate taxes on primary energy sources. In view of the fact that 42 percent of CO2
emissions come from energy production, 55 percent of primary sources are hard coal and lignite, we should
introduce incentives to shift electricity production from coal to more environmentally sound energy sources
and renewables.
Michael Kohlhaas, German Institute for Economic Research: During discussions on emissions trading in
Germany, political figures told us that we do not want emissions trading to have a strong influence on the
structure of electricity generation, on primary inputs. So I doubt that the current German government is interested in implementing primary energy taxation, because this is a deliberate instrument to change the structure of electricity generation. For regional and economic reasons, I do not anticipate such a policy being introduced.

POINT OF VIEW
The Background to the Climate Change Levy
Consultation on the Climate Change Levy began in early 1998 with a report from the Advisory Committee on
Business and the Environment. Then some form of levy was recommended by Lord Marshalls far-thinking
report, Economic Instruments and the Business use of Energy (October 1998). This report noted that if Britain did have a climate change levy, it would stimulate
the take-up of renewable energy. In Germany, the decision has been made to phase-out nuclear energy and
to replace this with renewable energy, whereas Britain
has approached this issue from a different angle,
saying that we want to reduce CO2 emissions  Kyoto
has put that pressure on us  and so how do we
achieve that take-up of renewables? At that time, we
were considering renewables, solar and wind energy
and more efficient energy generation in the form of
CHP (combined heat and power).
Following the announcement of plans for a levy in the
Chancellors Budget 1999, a Customs and Excise consultation, parliamentary debate and Government
negotiation with industry took place. Following this, the
Climate Change Levy (CCL) was introduced in April
2001 through provisions in the Finance Act 2000.
The Climate Change Levy is part of a package of
measures known as the Climate Change Programme
(CCP) and needs to be understood in the context of this
full package of measures.
The Climate Change Programme
The Climate Change Programme was published in November 2000 and detailed plans to deliver Kyoto targets and domestic climate change goals. It aimed to reduce green house gas emissions by 12.5 percent and
CO2 emissions by 20 percent by 2010 in relation to their 1990 levels.
It's main policies and measures include:
The Climate Change Levy (April 2001)
Establishment of the Carbon Trust (April 2001)
Emissions Trading Scheme (April 2002)
10 year transport plan (180 billion investment in public transport)
Double UK CHP capacity by 2010
Renewables Obligation: electricity generators target of 10 percent renewable by 2010 and 15 percent by 2015
New regulations for energy efficiency of buildings
Home energy efficiency scheme for domestic sector

The CCL: consultation responses & outcomes
It is worth noting at this point that if one makes political proposals, somebody  the electorate  has to agree
them. Although we can impose things on companies and on people, we are dependent upon them to vote us
back into power, so we have to be realistic.
The Conservatives were opposed to the climate change levy because they consider it to be anti-business 
they labelled it "badly thought out, badly targeted, damaging, anti-competitive and wrong. While competition
is certainly an important argument, Conservative party resistance to environmental policy in general is such
that we currently have a political vacuum on the Conservative side in the UK.
Of course, there has also been some response from industrial sectors, and the levy was opposed by those
industrial sectors most likely to be affected by the levy itself. However, we have already discussed how climate change programmes sweetened the pill to make the levy more attractive to those industrial sectors 
and I think a lot of good work has gone in there. In the end, the Government agreed to the following outcomes: the levy should target industrial and commercial energy use but not domestic energy use; the levy
should be fiscally neutral and with revenues recycled to business; special provisions should be made for energy intensive industries; and exemptions from the levy should be made for electricity generated from renewable sources.
Although I am quite critical of the government on environment in a lot of areas, I do not have any problem in
saying that one of the areas that has been more successful is working with business to make sure that we
dont use that anti-competitiveness as a barrier to dealing with climate change. The CCL was supported, albeit with serious reservations, by the Liberal Democrats and environmental NGOs that favoured a carbon
tax. But we nevertheless have to see the CCL in the context of what we are doing overall. We are concerned
 as the Green party is concerned  about the complexity of the levy in the long-term.
The CCL: Climate Change Agreements (CCAs)
CCAs were introduced to assist energy intensive sectors (currently 46 sectors, e.g. cement, steel, aluminium,
ceramics) and require negotiable targets for energy efficiency and carbon reduction to be met (negotiated
with trade associations). Businesses qualifying for climate change agreements receive an 80 percent discount on the climate change levy and the tax differential for CCAs worth around 300 million per year. In
their first year, CCAs saved 13.5 million tonnes of CO2 and 88 percent of CCA businesses met their targets.
However, while considerable savings in carbon have been made and 88 percent of targets met, it must be
said that some of those savings were delivered when the UK steel-making business collapsed. The UK's
main steel-making business, Corus, was the largest contributor to carbon emissions and when that collapsed, the UK had a quick win in terms of CO2 reduction, although it was of course extremely bad news for
the manufacturing industry in the UK. That is what a lot of what the climate change levy is about  delivering
quick wins  and businesses have taken the opportunity to see what else they could do to. Some of these
things were going to happen anyway. Indeed, some of our climate change wins have been quick wins as
well. These aspects were not only important in the past, but they are important today because we have to
consider where improvements to the CCL are going to come from in the future. But how will we continue delivering these benefits?
The CCL: Current Criticisms
Inefficient and unfair
The CCL is inefficient, because it only targets certain energy users. Moreover, it is unfair, because although
it is fiscally neutral on a macroscopic level, it impacts on some businesses more heavily than others. For example, the CCL generates around 1 billion per year  and one of the principle routes for recycling this revenue is a 0.3 percent discount for employer's National Insurance contributions33, which does not include a focus on energy and can benefit non energy-intensive businesses with a large number of employees, such as
call centres. There is no environmental gain whatsoever in reducing the employment costs on a call centre 
although they have a large number of people on low wages, they do not use a great deal of energy in terms
of what they are producing. So the CCL benefited these sectors without environmental gain.
A tax on employment that goes into general taxation.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 67
Complexity of the scheme undermines its effectiveness
Firstly, the complexity of the CCL makes it extremely difficult to measure the effect of the CCL amid a plethora of schemes, including the Carbon Trust, which is partly supported by CCL revenues. The Carbon Trust
received 69 million funding in 2003, 33 million of which was from CCL revenue. It runs the following programmes: the Action Energy Programme; the Enhanced Capital Allowances (100-140 million pa) scheme;
the Low Carbon Innovation Programme; the Emissions Trading Scheme (43 million pa).
The scheme is also too complicated and bureaucratic, for example, in its provision for exemption certificates
for combined heat and power and renewable energy generation.
 The CCL does not focus on carbon emissions
The CCL does not focus on carbon emissions but is a downstream tax on energy use.
 Little impact on SMEs
The CCL appears to have had little impact on SMEs (small to medium enterprises), indeed a survey carried
out by the Federation of Small Businesses, an industry group which tends to gather in employers of 15 or
less people, revealed that the CCL is virtually ignored by them. When the Federation asked their members
what difference the CCL had made to their business, how they had changed their operations  and this is a
very large number of small employers  over 92 percent of them said they had not responded at all. The
complexity of the scheme makes it totally unattractive for SMEs to do anything. So unless theyre in an industry group which uses a lot of energy and they can coat-tail on the back of what the rest of the scheme is
doing, theres very little interest for them.
To put this in context: Lord Marshalls 1998 report stated that 60 percent of small to medium enterprises
(SMEs) were responsible for 60 percent of business carbon emissions. So the CCL has made a large impact
on the big single emitters, such as high energy use plants, etc., but there are still untapped resources to be
had in terms of emissions reduction. But if we wish to impact on them, we have to consider what we can do
to change the scheme. With the current complicated scheme, we wont get to those people.
Lack of supporting policy, planning and direct investment
In the UK, there is a lack of direct investment in renewable energy sources. At present, we have a problem in
the UK because electricity is incredibly cheap at the moment. This is because British Energy, the UKs nuclear energy business, is hugely subsidised and we do not pay the full cost of ownership  as such, this
company has almost gone bankrupt a couple of times and has been rescued by the government, which continues to invest a great deal in keeping Britains nuclear show on the road. However, we also have to bear in
mind that we havent got such a strong renewables base in the UK as in Germany, and that the UK coal industry has been declining in a different way to the German coal industry  for different reasons and on a different economic basis. The problems Germany faces in terms of where it goes next with energy supply are
somewhat different to the ones in the UK, although we could probably be self-sufficient in wind energy if we
only could persuade everybody in planning to locate turbines all around the coast of Britain. However, as an
overcrowded island, we face huge resistance when trying to deliver wind turbines.
Let me give you an example from my constituency. The European headquarters of BOC, the British Oxygen
Company tell me they are ready to go with combined heat and power (CHP)  their electricity is their highest
cost. But because theyre going to be charged a lot of money for getting onto the national grid, they are stalling on going with CHP. So the opportunity for a beneficial bio-fuel system exists, but it is being delayed until
we get that problem overcome.
The CCL has had little impact on the public
Finally, the CCL was targeted towards industry, and has thus had little impact on the general public. Unfortunately, this means that it is hardly likely to change the behaviour of the general public in relation to energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
CCL: Potential Improvements
To improve the CCL, CCAs should be extended to more businesses, or all businesses. The revenues from
the CCL must be increasingly targeted towards energy-related schemes. The levy itself must be increased,
in order to strengthen the fiscal incentives for investments in renewables. The scheme itself must be simplified or alternatively, replaced with a much simpler carbon tax.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 68
Carbon Tax: The Liberal Democrat Policy
The Liberal Democrats believe that we need to move towards a simpler system that directly and transparently targets carbon, i.e. a carbon tax, similar to the European system. We believe that the CCL should develop in this direction. A carbon tax would have many advantages. It would harmonise easily with other EU
countries that already have a carbon tax or will in the future, it would reach the small businesses that do not
qualify for the Emissions Trading Scheme, and it would impact on the domestic sector  although additional
measures would be necessary to protect the less affluent against fuel poverty. Moreover, it would reach the
transport sector, could be expanded to include aviation fuel in the long term. Such a tax could also introduce
measures to assist carbon intensive industries  although this should be limited in terms of time  and is favoured by environmental NGOs and the Royal Society.
Conclusion: The Need For More Renewable Energy
It is going to be interesting to see how we can make sure that we have a cap on emissions, that we have
trading, that we have the opportunity for auction. It will be interesting to see if the UK actually lets electricity
prices rise to their true cost  in this regard, the Liberal Democrats would not subsidise British Energy because of the huge cost of ownership, and this would certainly push up energy prices. But that doesnt solve
the problem of the dirtiest industries, because nuclear is not our dirtiest producer of electricity.
But one thing that the UK has to do is create trading arrangements which are very much better in relation to
renewable energy. We have still failed to include renewable energy sufficiently in the UK, because our pricing arrangements are wrong and in this respect the UK's trading arrangements need tweaking  theyre not
attractive at the moment to business. Until we get renewable energy thats really working that wont happen.
Although we in the UK are taking these quick wins and saying that we are progressing well towards our
Kyoto targets, what we forget is that we have very happily failed to develop our alternative energy market in
the way that Denmark has done, in the way that Germany has done, that we are not exporting a great deal.
What we are exporting is very dirty technology. In fact, the environmental audit committee found that almost
all our gains and wins on Kyoto at home are almost completely negated by our dirty exports.

ECOT AXES IN GERM ANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM: STATUS QUO, ANALYSIS AND
PERSPECTIVES
Introduction: A Landscape of Conflict
First of all, I would like to say that the ecological tax reform
is a success story in Germany, but nobody knows it. This is
one of the policys key problems. Although I'm afraid not
everybody
shares
this
point
view.
The context of the ecological tax reform in Germany is a
landscape of conflict.
The background to the implementation of the ecological tax
reform was as follows: resistance to ecotax was strong
among the German public, and public debate was
extremely polarised and very extreme. Demonstrations
attended by miners, truckers, and farmers were held
against the ecological tax reform in front of the Reichstag.
Worse still, politicians from German opposition parties
went out to support the demonstrators and to show them
solidarity  which was good for their reception in the public
eye, but was definitely very problematic in terms of policymaking.
Another enemy of the ecotax was the Bild Zeitung  the German equivalent of the Sun  which published extremely polarised arguments against the reform. The German Industry Association (BDI) was very much opposed to ecotax reform, as was the German Car Drivers Association (ADAC). Another problem was that
support was quite weak from the environmental camp, at least in the beginning, because they regarded the
reform as too weak and not far-reaching enough. Furthermore, those who really profited from the ecological
tax reform, those who make money from energy efficiency, from energy conservation, from home insulation,
from renewable energies and so on, didnt strongly support the ecological tax reform either.
So for these reasons, the situation was somewhat frustrating, at least during the first two years when we
were introducing the reform.
Nevertheless, we were re-elected in 2002, ironically enough for two energy-related reasons. The first was
Iraq, as many believed that there was a hidden oil-related agenda behind the Iraqi war. Secondly, there was
an enormous flood in Germany in late August / early September, just four weeks before the elections took
place, and a lot of people thought that this was probably related to climate change and the way we waste
energy. At the end of the day, the situation was good for the government and for the Greens, because when
the government was asked what it had done to combat climate change, to promote energy conservation, to
reduce our total dependence on oil imports, we were able to give some answers, including the ecological tax
reform.
In the coalition agreement between the Greens and the SPD, we agreed to re-evaluate the ecological tax reform in 2004. We want to consider if and how we will develop the ecological tax reform in the light of energy
prices, the economic situation and our previous experience with the reform.
The Instrument Mix
The Green party believes that ecological tax reform is only one element in a mix of instruments for ecological
fiscal reform. Some have already been mentioned, standards have been laid down in some areas, and there
is strong state support for renewables in Germany, not only through subsidies, but also by means of a
mechanism that we call the feed-in Directive. This means that everyone that generates electricity from renewable sources and feeds it into the national grid is offered very attractive conditions  and this has increased the share of renewables enormously. Our national target is to increase the share of renewables by
as much as 20 percent by 2020 through this law.
In view of this extremely wide range of instruments, one of our most important political tasks is to make these
instruments as compatible and as coherent as possible.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 70
The Ecological Tax Reform: Implementation and Impact
The ecological tax reform was implemented in five stages, starting in 1999 and running to 2003. Taxes on
gasoline were increased in five stages, an electricity tax was introduced and increased in five stages, tax
burdens were applied to gas and oil for heating purposes. Interestingly, 90 percent of the revenue raised was
used to reduce ancillary wage costs  what is referred to in Germany as pension insurance. This rested on
the age-old philosophy of killing two birds with one stone  improving energy efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions and creating new jobs at the same time. Five percent was used for improving home insulation and for
renewable energies, and the other five percent was used for the consolidation of the budget.
I think the underlying idea behind the tax is still is a very good idea. Particularly because in Germany we
have a comparatively low level of direct taxes  in this case, we are low down in the European ranking. In
terms of indirect taxes  consumer taxes  we are somewhere in the middle. But in the third tax category,
ancillary wage costs, we are right at the top of the leader board. We effectively penalise the creation of jobs.
This is still the key problem in Germany. Restructuring the tax system away from high ancillary wage costs
and towards indirect taxes is a still a very necessary measure and a good general approach which does not
have much to do with energy or climate protection but has a great deal of relevance in relation to our poorly
structured tax system.
Thus, the ecotax substantially reduced ancillary wage costs. Without the ecotax, the contribution of employers and employees to the pension insurance would have been 21.2 percent and now it is 19.5 percent 
which is almost 10 percent less, a significant amount. As regards the environment, gasoline consumption fell
constantly in Germany from 1999 onwards by about 2 percent each year. It is difficult to attribute this development directly to the ecological tax reform, as it is largely attributable to the general development of gasoline prices, but nevertheless, these changes are also as a result of the ecological tax reform and the general
public perceives them as such. Additionally, consumption in private households was reduced by between 0.5
and 1 percent every year. This is a very fundamental change compared to the period from 1990-1999. At this
time, in energy consumption in the private household and traffic and transport sectors was increasing rapidly,
a trend that was broken in 1999  and in these areas, consumption has been falling ever since, albeit modestly as a result of the ecological tax reform.
We also introduced other legislation in the period, including tax exemptions for bio-fuels and for gas in electricity generation if it is used in highly efficient power plants, i.e. combined heat and power plants. To sum up,
the ecological tax reform has been a relevant instrument over the past 5 years.
Future policies
The question is now what to do in the future  as I said, the Greens wish to re-evaluate the tax in 2004. What
I would like to propose is what I would call a three basket approach. The first basket is for the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies; the second is for tax incentives for more environmentally friendly behaviour
in the existing system; and the third is for ecological tax reform.
The first basket for the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies is geared towards lessening the considerable number of environmentally harmful subsidies in the German system, such as subsidies for housing
or commuting. This costs the taxpayer  25 billion per year in total. Reducing these subsidies is a huge challenge, because the interest groups involved are well organised and powerful, but we are quite optimistic that
we will be able to make a difference in relation to households and commuting  at least this is most likely 
so this is our first aim. We could use the revenues saved for future-oriented purposes, such as education, research and development, etc. This is the will of the government as a whole.
The second basket aims to create tax incentives in the existing system, as we would like to create a more
environmentally friendly tax system. There are a great many tax distortions in Germany  for example within
the Value-Added Tax system, where there is no VAT on air tickets, but there is on rail tickets. What we will
present soon is a proposal to increase VAT on air tickets and to reduce VAT on rail tickets in the innerEuropean transportation system. This would allow for fairer competition between rail and air travel. Another
example is car tax. We wish to restructure the system to provide more incentives for low-emission cars, to
provide incentives to drive more efficient vehicles, to reduce particulates.
The third basket refers to ecological tax reform in general. We have agreed on a timetable saying that we
wish to present our results to the general public in October 2004. We have to learn from our mistakes, not
only in terms of communication, but also because channelling fresh money from the ecotax into the German
pension system overshadows the need to reform, restructure and modernise the system as a whole and
bring it into line with demographic realities.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we should maintain the relationship between indirect consumer taxes, energy taxes and ancillary wage costs, but we should not channel all the revenues raised into the social system. Perhaps we
should simple leave it to parliament to decide how it should be used. The more money is earmarked, the
more the capacity of parliament to shape the future is reduced.

SESSION 4, PANEL DISCUSSION WITH THE SPEAKERS
Moderator: Anselm Grres, Green Budget Germany Chairman
Panel:
Sue Doughty MP, Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister of the Environment
Franz-Martin Dbel, Managing Director of the Institute for Market Creation for Alternative Fuels
Christos Liolios, European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union
Reinhard Loske, Vice-Chairman of the Green Group in the German Parliament
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting
Eva Kraav, Estonian Ministry of the Environment: I know that there were energy taxes on fuel in Germany before 2001. I understand that these taxes were spent on pensions reform  they were earmarked 
and that this process was labelled ecological tax reform. But now, I would like to know where this reform is?
You had these taxes before 2001  where was the reform here?
Secondly, where are the limits of this reform? How much would you like to increase these energy taxes by?
Dr. Alfred Rdler, Green Budget Germany Advisory Board: I think that one important point was missing
in our discussion of reform in Germany  the European aspect. We have an internal market within the European Union, and the internal market as it exists today limits national possibilities of increasing taxes on petrol
and diesel. If we increase taxes too much, consumers, particularly those from the transport industry, simply
go abroad to buy diesel.
Anja von Moltke, United Nations Environment Program: The United Nations has been interested in the
use of incentive measures and taxes for a long time and although we focus on developing countries, the issues are much the same everywhere. One of the focuses of our work has been on subsidies  the environmentally harmful nature of subsidies and their market distortiveness.
Im glad that this issue was brought up in Reinhard Loskes presentation, but I felt this was not sufficiently
addressed by the other speakers today. So my question is to the other speakers: to what extent are the efforts being undertaken with regard to ecological tax reform compatible with the existence of environmentally
harmful subsidies?
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting, panel: With reference to the question of intra-EU competitiveness: yes,
its clearly an issue, but as Europe tends towards greater harmonisation, I think the issue is becoming increasingly an issue of extra-EU competitiveness. If you look to the legislation on the European emissions
trading Directive, when DG competition looks at state aid or issues regarding the allocation of emissions allowances they give member states flexibility for allocating allowances where there are extra-EU competition
issues, but not when there are intra-EU competition issues.
Reinhard Loske, Vice-Chairman of the Green Group in the German Parliament, panel: The ecological
tax reform is not a case of re-naming. The figures show that in 1998, when we came to power, the share of
energy taxes on the total income of the federal government was 7 percent. Now, after five steps of ecological
tax reform, it is 8.7 percent, so there has been some development. Of course, we did have energy taxes before this. We did have gasoline taxes and we increased them. We did have taxes on gas and oil for heating
purposes and we slightly increased them. But we did not have taxes on electricity, so we introduced and increased them. This was really restructuring  we earmarked the money for a special purpose, for the reduction of pension payments.
Secondly, on the question of limits  the German Green party learnt a bitter lesson in this respect during the
1998 election campaign, when we said that a litre of gasoline should cost 5 Deutschmarks, that is, two and a
half Euros. We dropped in the polls from 8 to 4 percent  a considerable drop. But our main argument has
been and still is that there are limits to taxation, and for this reason we argue in favour of revenue neutrality 
we do not want more taxes, just different taxes, a different structure of taxation.
As for the European context: tax policies are not within the jurisdiction of the European Union, these are left
to the member states. However, a certain degree of standardisation and harmonisation is definitely needed,
at least in relation to minimum standards, to avoid competitive distortions. When we look at the German tax
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 73
structure, however, it is almost perverse. While low income taxes can be regarded as acceptable and we are
in the lower half of the mid field for consumer taxes in Europe, our ancillary wage costs are extremely high 
in this respect, there is still room for restructuring.
Finally, subsidies are often not taken into consideration. Money is spent on the wrong things due to political
debate. I agree, subsidies should be removed, but it is a very controversial issue. If we want to invest in the
future and not keep old structures alive against market tendencies, it is very clear that we have to reduce
subsidies.
Sue Doughty MP, Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister of the Environment, panel:
In the UK, we raised gasoline and diesel prices using the Fuel Duty Escalator, but we did not allow for the
world-wide increase in oil prices, which resulted in fuel becoming very expensive. Today, freight from Europe
is entering the UK on lorries that fill-up their very large fuel tanks before they come into Britain, which has a
considerable impact on our domestic freight industry. Although environmentalists would like to see less
freight transport on lorries in any case, the reality is that petrol pricing in the UK provides a way in for overseas lorries, which is of course a big problem for the UK freight industry. For this reason, we have now decided in the UK that there will be an upper limit on fuel duty  but this did come a bit late.
Another group that was seriously affected by the Fuel Duty Escalator were less affluent individuals in rural
areas, because they need to use cars in the absence of public transport. While it is possible to argue that the
policy encourages good public transport use in cities, public transport is simply not an option in rural areas.
Secondly, with reference to subsidies, we carried out an investigation into what the export credit guarantee
department is doing in relation to the export of technologies. The department is seen as an arm of the department of trade and industry, and it unintentionally but nevertheless very effectively subsidises the arms
trade. Obviously, we are extremely concerned about this issue. Furthermore, the department also fails to
consider the suitability of technologies for the recipient country. We discovered that many of the technologies
we export would not be used in the UK because they were very heavily polluting. Thus, we urgently need to
build up our experience and expertise in exporting clean technologies and promote them more  because
they often bring about change faster than complex technologies that require expensive infrastructures.
Anselm Grres, Green Budget Germany Chairman, moderator: International studies indicate that the
value of worldwide environmentally harmful subsidies is between $500 billion and $1 trillion. With reference
to the limits of ecological tax reform  we must explain to people that the price level does not have to increase any more once we reach the point where we switch from bad energy to good energy.
Christos Liolios, European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union, panel: With reference to
the question of limited opportunities to increase taxes on fuels - states that are willing to increase taxes on
fuels can only do this to a limited extent if their neighbours do not  and for this reason, minimum taxation
rates have been made obligatory for all member states. However, as I have already said, the Commission
failed to harmonise energy tax based 50 percent on emissions and 50 percent on energy content in 1992,
largely because member states did not want to lose sovereignty on the issue. There is no easy solution to
the problem of higher tax rates in some member states than others.
The Commission currently has a measure on the table to decouple the relationship between taxation on
HGVs and passenger cars, and to tax diesel at different levels for HGVs. This is a response to the fact that
lorries for international freight transport can drive 300 km on one tank of fuel  and for this reason, Luxembourg sells 5 times more diesel than the Community average. Of course, this is a problem. But in this context, the unanimity rule remains valid  and I do not know how many proposals the Commission makes in relation to the number of proposals that are successful. The last proposal was discussed for six years before it
was accepted.
Raivo Vilu, Tallinn Technical University: I would like to support the European Commission in raising CO2
tax and in harmonising it. But I am surprised that no one has mentioned the issue of environmental space 
meaning consumption of environmental resources calculated on a per capita basis, this year e.g. two litres of
gasoline per day per person. My question is, what will happen next year when negotiations on post-Kyoto
mechanisms will presumably begin  what do you expect from this?
Hans-Christoph Binswanger, Institute for Economics and Ecology, University of St. Gallen: I would
like to stick with the double dividend in the energy tax reform  I do not see why lowering the pensions burden could hinder tax reform. If the monies from tax reform are simply passed on to parliament, then there is a
real danger that parliament will use this money to increase the budget. The mentality behind the ecological
tax reform will be lost.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 74
Jan F. Wagner, correspondent for Environment Daily: Reinhard Loske, you said in two weeks that the
Green party would be unveiling three initiatives that pertain to the ecological tax reform. Could you tell us to
what extent you think you will get what you want? Will you be able to agree on these measures with the coalition with the SPD and get them through parliament?
Secondly, with reference to your view on the development of the ecotax. Are you in favour of raising it when
the review has been completed at the end of the year?
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting, panel: With reference to subsidies, theres one particular subsidy which
has not been touched on today  the Common Agricultural Policy, a subsidy that is destroying the developing world as well as our own environment within Europe. So I would like to put a fourth question to Green
Budget Germany and to the European Commission. Is it on Green Budget Germanys agenda to tackle the
problems posed by the CAP? I would also ask the European Commission what their position is on the issue,
if I may.
As to the issue of contraction and convergence and possibilities for post-2012 negotiations for Kyoto - I left
my crystal ball at home, but I personally think it is a valid idea, as there has to be some equivalence and convergence at some point. But sadly, I think that we are a long way away from it. I think a necessary first step is
step is to get the United States involved in
international negotiations, to try and get US
emissions levels down to levels which India, China,
Brazil and Argentina would aspire to in the long run.
But I think this is many years away  a rather
disappointing prognosis.
As for pensions, I entirely agree that any delay in
pensions reform is just making the situation worse,
so in that sense, using revenue from the ecological
tax reform to delay any hard decisions on pension
reform will inevitably make the decision much
harder. I have seen some alarming demographics for
the UIK showing the imbalance between those who
are paying the state pension and those who are
drawing on it and how that is changing over time 
Guy Turner (left) and Reinhard Loske
and the sooner these issues are addressed the better.
Reinhard Loske, Vice-Chairman of the Green Group in the German Parliament, panel: First of all, I am
very much in favour of contraction and convergence concept, developed by Aubrey Meyer of the Global
Commons Institute. The supporting notion of the Kyoto protocol is this methodology, that the industrialised
countries have to reduce because they are historically responsible for 80 percent of the CO2 already in the
atmosphere, while developing countries are allowed to grow, but not at the same rate as they would do without new technologies. The basic idea is that these countries leapfrog or tunnel through the energy-intensive
period of development which we saw in the West.
As to the next commitment period after 2012: there is still a credibility gap in the industrialised countries,
even in Europe. We have not done our homework convincingly enough to expect reduction targets or even
caps from developing countries  and it is very important to get developing countries on board, countries like
China, Indonesia, Brazil and others  so that they have some sort of cap, not a reduction target, not even a
stabilisation target. Convergence means more sustainable levels of growth, if we want to revitalise the idea
of CO2 taxation in principle. But already in 1991, proposals for this had been put forward by Carlo Ripa de
Meana, the Environmental Commissioner of the time  his idea was to introduce a combined CO2 energy tax
starting in 1993, of $3 per barrel of oil and increasing by $1 every year to reach $10 by the year 2000. It was
thought to be a credibility package from the European Union for the 1992 Rio Summit on Environmental Development, to show the world that the EU was willing to act, that the EU had a CO2 and energy taxation system. But in fact what happened was that the meeting of the ministers in May 1992 agreed that this taxation
would be introduced only if other OECD countries did the same  so the idea of harmonisation was behind it
in some sense but as a result of this demand, it also didn't happen. And that is the sad history of the CO2 tax.
With reference to Professor Binswanger's point: as you know, I always argued in favour of the double dividend but looking back and being honest, the introduction of the double dividend can be attributed to the 1998
SPD election campaign. Oskar Lafontaine, the former de facto opposition leader, heavily criticised the introduction of a so-called demographic factor into the pension system by the conservative-liberal government in
1997, saying it was anti-social and unfair to pensioners, so the fresh money from the ecological tax reform
was very welcome to avoid reform. But in 2001 and 2002 it was much more difficult for us to introduce a
pension fund reform and to be honest we are not yet finished. I'm not saying that we should not input any
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 75
money from the ecological tax reform into the pension system, but what we need is a pension fund reform
which recognises demographic realities.
With reference to the final question on the probability of getting all our proposals through. Our plans to reduce VAT on rail tickets for journeys of over 50 kilometres and to finance this through the introduction of VAT
on air tickets has already been negotiated between the coalition partners. We will decide on this very soon 
the issue is whether we can push this legislation through the Bundesrat.
Sue Doughty MP, Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister of the Environment, panel: With regard to postKyoto, one of the issues we are going to have to address is the emerging industrial nations  what stance
should we take. Germany still has a very strong manufacturing base, while the UK does not, but in any case,
many industrial processes will eventually relocate to China  whether it's waste recovery, materials recovery
or manufacturing  we know that China will be selling to us. Developments in India are similar. We will have
to make difficult decisions regarding imports  do we stipulate that we will only import goods that have been
produced under good environmental and social conditions, or do we stipulate that we will support their aim of
being economically self-sufficient. There is a degree of conflict in those two points of view and by the time
the World Trade Organisation is involved as well, we are going to be faced by hard decisions. No matter how
environmentally friendly we are, no matter how much we want to see these developments, decisions will
have to made about where to draw the line with these particular countries. The answer is to weigh up the
costs and benefits of these different scenarios for us, for them, and for the planet as a whole. We need to be
aware that exporting our carbon generating processes does not make the world a cleaner place. Although
we will become cleaner, places elsewhere will become dirtier, not only in terms of technologies but in terms
of manufacturing and so on. This is a great challenge of the future.
Traditionally in the UK we have not paid VAT on public transport. There is an ongoing debate in the UK
about predict and provide air travel and environmentalists argue that if we let this rise as it is predicted to do
it will be hugely polluting. We are now only getting to the point where the government has acknowledged that
we must somehow brake this process either through passenger, fuel or emissions taxation. It is not easy to
push through such legislation, as the government has been elected by many people who believe that they
have a right to cheap air fares  so this has unfortunately become an electoral issue.
Anselm Grres, Green Budget Germany Chairman, moderator: With reference to Guy Turner's comment
on the Common Agricultural Policy, Green Budget Germany supported a research study on subsidies in Germany and many of these subsidies rest on European law. We do not neglect the issue.
Secondly, as to the issue of the double dividend. The German pension system costs  200 billion annually 
and before ecotaxes, that was subsidised by  50 billion from the government  and rightly so, because a lot
of what the pension system costs have nothing to do with the insurance equivalence principle but are a result
of a political obligation, partly as a result of German unity. We have always said that we can support it as
long as this is used to compensate for things that have nothing to do with subsidising pensions but are used
to cover these social obligations. We have helped through ecotax to increase government subsidies to the
pension fund from about  60 to  76 billion. Now what we have is a situation where every third Euro paid out
as a pension is funded by ecological taxation and we believe that this is enough and fear justified criticism if
we argue in favour of putting yet more money into the government budget.
Reinhard Loske, Vice-Chairman of the Green Group in the German Parliament, panel: Another problem
of the ecotax was our message management. In the years 1999, 2000 and 2001 our message was absolutely clear  we said that we would increase ecotaxes and reduce pension fund contributions. In the year
2002, due to a lack of reform in the pension fund system, ecotaxes increased and ancillary wage costs remained constant. In 2003, ecotaxes were raised but pension contributions increased as well  and although
we pointed out that it would have increased even more if it wasn't for the ecotax, the clear message of killing
two birds with one stone was lost.
Franz-Martin Dbel, Managing Director of the Institute for Market Creation for Alternative Fuels and
former Ford Manager, panel: May I add something to the taxation of fuel discussed earlier. Vehicle engine
development takes about eight years  it is always a medium-term exercise to change anything on a vehicle.
In Germany we have a differentiated taxation system, where engines are taxed for power, displacement and
fuel. To make this taxation economically correct, it would seem much better to find a medium-range strategy
to harmonise the taxation of fuels in the EU. This would encourage OEMs to develop their strategies in the
right direction, towards engine and vehicle development. At the end of the day, this would pay economically.
Christos Liolios, European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union, panel: Just one clarification
concerning the CO2 tax - this tax is history, since the Commission officially withdrew this proposal in 2001 fol-
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 76
lowing the 1996 failure to pass it through the Council. At the time, the Council wished to follow a different approach, to introduce minimum rates. Thus, we do not discuss fuel tax harmonisation any more, but the harmonisation of tax bases. We make minimum levels of taxation obligatory for all, but not maximum.
Ray Cunningham, Anglo-German Foundation: I can see the rationale, or at least the attraction of earmarking the revenue from the ecotax to go into the pensions fund system. It meets the goal of revenue neutrality, it makes the tax easier to sell to business and to the electorate. But it seems to me these first two
goals could have been met in various other ways, not least by reductions in corporation tax, assuming that
you can find any companies that pay corporation tax in Germany. It has always seemed to me to leave a major suspicion that this double dividend has been used to sell the tax to the electorate  and that carries major
political costs and possibly rising costs in the future, in the sense that it looks like a transparent means to sell
the tax to the electorate. If you have an ecological tax, it makes much more sense to pursue consistent goals
with that and to dedicate the revenues to ecological purposes. To me, it does not seem to be "killing two
birds with one stone", but rather, "buying a bird and getting a pig free". It feels like a trick. I wonder in retrospect if you would be tempted now to decouple that link and to dedicate the revenues from ecotaxes to more
obviously ecological policy objectives.
Helmut Jansen, German Finance Ministry: There has recently been a shift in policy from financing street
use with charges rather than taxation, for example, the congestion charge in London and the HGV policies of
the EU. What does the panel think about this shift from taxation to road tolls and charges?
Christos Liolios, European Commission, DG Taxation and Customs Union, panel: What charge means
is a charge for a service rendered whereas when a tax is imposed, you are not obliged to use the revenue for
the service taxed. For instance, we have been discussing a tax on aviation fuel, or alternatively, an aviation
charge, levied when planes pass over a particular air space.
In my Directorate General we are competent for taxes, but not for charges, because they are proportional to
a service rendered by a national authority and are a national issue, managed locally. This is the general approach at the EU. A charge has to be proportional to the service rendered, taxes finance whatever we decide.
Franz-Martin Dbel, Managing Director of the Institute for Market Creation for Alternative Fuels and
former Ford Manager, panel: The congestion charge is a very good example of how OEMs respond to policy. At Ford, we developed LPG cars and vans for London in response to the congestion charge, but the
public response was to transfer to public transport rather than purchase new clean vehicles. Ford spent several million pounds which could have been better used to invest in the development of CNG vehicles in Germany and other European countries. This underpins once more how necessary it is to have an EU-wide
strategy. When national governments act, they effect companies  and this can be problematic if it does not
coincide with other European governments.
Sue Doughty MP, Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister of the Environment, panel: Anything that looks
like European taxation in the UK will be deeply unpopular bearing in mind that 20% of the electorate voted
effectively to leave the EU in the recent European election. I suspect it would be very difficult for the national
government, for Tony Blair, to stand by a European tax that applies in the UK.
I have a great deal of sympathy with the development
of a congestion charge. One of the most difficult issues is the South East of London  and the South
East of England  is that in fact one of our problems
is not only the pollution from congestion but quite
literally the congestion itself and gridlock. Even the
Confederation of British Industry was beginning to
argue in favour of more public transport. It would not
be easy to introduce the congestion charge in my
home constituency of Guildford, for example, without
providing a cost-effective public transport alternative.
In smaller towns and cities, the economics of a
charge are much less viable than in London. It is not
easy to make any congestion charging system costneutral to the traveller.
Sue Doughty MP and Kai Schlegelmilch
Reinhard Loske, Vice-Chairman of the Green Group in the German Parliament, panel: There have always been two schools of thought as regards ecological tax reform, as well as two factions in the Green
party and in the German public as well. The first school, led by Professor Binswanger, argues in favour of
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 77
combining the ideas of job creation and environmental protection  reducing the tax burden on labour while
increasing the tax burden on energy or resource consumption, which is quite an appropriate model for a redgreen coalition  jobs and the environment.
The second school argues in favour of increasing tax on energy and resource consumption and using the
revenues raised for environmental purposes. This is also acceptable and more attractive to the public. My
argument has always been, as long as there is so much money in the public budget used for environmentally
harmful things  coal subsidies, etc.  it makes more sense to put this money to good environmental use. If
we were more successful in reducing environmentally harmful subsidies we would be able to say we invest
part of the revenue in environmental purposes  we will see. Our concept will be submitted in autumn.
One problem with the former school is that reducing ancillary wage costs on a relevant scale costs a lot of
money. The tax burden on energy and resources would need to be increased enormously. If you use ecotax
revenue for environmental investments, you simply need less. Moreover, 70 or 80 percent of the public are
opposed to the notion of job creation and environmental taxation. Nevertheless, it remains an open question.
There have always been these two schools of thought.
Guy Turner, Enviros Consulting, panel: With reference to Helmut Jansen's question concerning the congestion charge, I would resort to basic economic principles to answer it  first address the objective and then
design an instrument to achieve that objective. If the objective is a general reduction in C02 emissions from
vehicles, then a C02 tax, or fuel tax or duty on fuel is applicable. If it is congestion that is the problem, i.e. occupation of road space at peak times, then a congestion charge is more appropriate. The efficiency of the instrument is the issue.
I did some work for the European Commission about ten years ago on this under the fifth environmental action program. One of the main points that came out was that the bluntness and broadness of instruments is
very significant: the best outcome is clarity  if you want to address a particular issue, design the instrument
to address that issue. Congestion is a very different thing to bad things in general about road transport, such
as noise, take-up of agricultural land, C02 emissions, particulate emissions, etc.
With regard to revenue recycling and the double dividend  we have three examples of ecological taxes in
the UK. Firstly, the fuel duty on petrol, which goes to the treasury. Secondly, the climate change levy, which
was specifically directed towards reductions in national insurance contributions in a very similar way to the
ecological tax reform in Germany. More interestingly, we also have an example of hypothecation back to environmental objectives from the UK landfill tax, where a tax was imposed on waste to landfill and virtually all
of it was recycled through a credit scheme, originally to help communities around landfill sites. It has now
been reformulated to help recycling and address the problem that the tax was designed to hit in the first
place.
Anselm Grres, Green Budget Germany Chairman, moderator: The last two questions provide me with
the opportunity to point out two real innovations in our new Green Budget Germany policy program.
Firstly, with reference to vehicle fuel tax. In Germany, cars and HGVs are two separate issues. German
trucks suffer much more than in the UK because it is not difficult to drive over the border to obtain cheaper
fuels if diesel is heavily taxed in Germany. The international European market dictates a limiting factor on the
taxation of fuels for HGVs  for competitiveness reasons, we cannot raise taxes much beyond those of our
neighbours. So, if we want to make HGV traffic more expensive, then the best instrument is to introduce an
HGV toll  which we have, although it is still not operational. Road tolls for cars, on the other hand, are unnecessary, as we can maintain a certain distance to our outer borders, and although it is a problem at Germany's borders, it is not a major competitive problem.
The question of the double dividend has been the subject of a great deal of debate within the green movement. In our new programme, we have made a concession to the saleability of the ecological tax reform to
the public by conceding that 10 percent of receipts from the ecotax go into green projects. But a proportion of
the ecotax should continue to go into the pensions system, not more than before. We think that the benefit of
green taxation is in its existence, because people change their behaviour.
In a democracy, parliament should have ultimate authority over the budget  it's not our job to dictate this 
as earmarking is not progressive in the long run.
Conference Report: Ecotaxes in Germany and the United Kingdom  A Business View
Page 78
K AI SCHLEGELMILCH, GREEN BUDGET GERM ANY VICE CHAIRM AN, CONCLUDING REM ARKS
Summarising such an enriching and fantastic conference is
impossible. But perhaps I can highlight some of the lessons
learned:
First of all, my working thesis, my motivation for initiating this
conference, has partly been confirmed, although the
underlying features are more complex: UK industry faces a
net burden due to the climate change levy whereas German
industry benefits from net tax relief overall. However, the latter
communicate differently and give the impression that
production is at risk of being relocated abroad, for which no
indication or even evidence is available. On the other hand,
the challenge facing UK industry due to the climate change
levy is hardly known to the general public. And here in the
UK, it is only business which pays, while in almost all other
countries, the major burden is on transport and private
households. Hence, in Germany there is room for manoeuvre
to strengthen incentives for industry, while in the UK there is a
large potential to promote more insulation and energy
efficiency in housing  probably ideally by means of grants,
low-interest loans and levies.
What are the other options we heard about today? I would like to draw your attention to kerosene taxation, a
potential area for harmonisation in the EU in future. The new EU energy tax Directive has given EU member
states the opportunity to levy kerosene tax on domestic flights and flights between two member states. Then
we have seen that diesel is taxed at the same rate as petrol in the UK and Switzerland  a policy Germany
should learn from. We can also learn from the Fuel Duty Escalator in the UK, which operates in addition to
inflation  the automatic indexation of fuel taxation in Germany certainly merits discussion, as it would mean
that politicians would not have to increase taxes every year at their discretion, but that taxes could increase
in the background with inflation without political discussion. To put it more diplomatically, the incentive effect
of these taxes could thus be kept intact.
During the conference we have seen the interplay of a broad range of economic instruments, emissions trading and ecotaxes. I would say that not only do prices matter, but prices and awareness matter  and a combination of the two really pushes towards reducing energy consumption  and that is what we are aiming for.
BP policy adviser Charles Nicholson pointed out that it is critical to get the process started, and I think that's
what we have succeeded in doing in the UK and Germany. We would like to encourage other countries to
come on board  there is some interest in this issue, but implementation is mostly slow.
We should remember as well that expected costs are always higher than real costs in the end  and for this
reason, raising awareness is very important. Energy management systems might have an important part to
play in triggering additional energy savings. Despite the good reception of the climate change agreements in
the UK, we should also keep in mind the negative experiences we've had in Germany with the so-called voluntary agreements: In the year 2000, industry made environmental commitments (they are hardly really voluntary) to reduce CO2 emissions, commitments which they revoked when the environment minister tried to
nail their own targets down for Germanys national allocation plan for the EU emissions trading scheme. This
does call into question the extent to which we can rely on and trust in that particular instrument. My conclusion is that an effective sanctioning mechanism is required.
The reduction of perverse subsidies is very difficult but we have some hopes for the new proposals Reinhard
Loske outlined, his "three basket approach". But the incomprehensibly high subsidisation of the German hard
coal sector makes me extremely sceptical in this regard.
What we are hoping for is better EU coordination in the future  but I'm afraid we will only get the next round
when we have the next accession phase. Regrettably, the UK has just succeeded in inserting into the Energy Chapter of the EU treaty that there should always be unanimity voting on fiscal matters which are explicitly energy-related issues. Here, we would have wished the UK had followed the attitude of the German
government to favour qualified majority voting on all fiscal matters, or at least on energy taxation. My last
hopes rest on article 96 of the current EU Treaty, which allows for qualified majority voting in certain circumstances.

The good news is, we only have to tax until we have reached backstop technology, or the solar age  we do
not have to tax forever, but only until we have transferred to sustainable technologies. This is very important
and this is of course the aim of the ecotax  in this sense, there is a limit to ecological tax reform. If the UK
keeps this in mind, perhaps it could be more relaxed when it comes to the hot issue of qualified majority voting. But Germany has to do its homework this year as well and use the chance to further develop the Ecological Tax Reform in Germany. In addition, current approaches to initiate the exchange of information, e.g.
with the Czech Republic and Poland, should be extended to increase understanding and attract more countries to follow our example.
We hope that we can build on the constructive discussions we had today in the future  Green Budget Germany is extremely interested in dialogue with companies and politicians, at conferences or elsewhere. Conferences such as this provide us with insights into how ecotaxes can be better implemented, and we hope
that our productive exchange of information and experiences today will help us to improve both our ecotax
systems in the future. You as speakers and discussants, as host, organisers and funding bodies, as participants and not at least interpreters, made this great success possible  thank you very much!
Perhaps there will be a follow up to this encouraging and inspiring conference and we will meet again,
maybe in London in 2005?

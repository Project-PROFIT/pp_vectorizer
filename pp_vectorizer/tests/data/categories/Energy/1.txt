FOREWORD
A decade and more has elapsed since 1989, before energy policy makers in central and
eastern Europe (CEE) initiated the process of restructuring the district heating (DH) and
combined heat and power (CHP) industries. The reason: these industries were intimately
integrated with electricity generation; their reform had to await the reform of the electric
power industry.
By 2000-2002, the unbundling of both sectors began. It revealed the true extent of the
difficulties of the DH/CHP industries:
enormous losses in generation, transmission, distribution and end-use
lack of cost effectiveness and profitability
irregular service to customers
inadequacy of institutional structures.
It also revealed the extraordinary importance of central heat supplies in CEE: the region leads
the world in central heat supply infrastructure and heat compares with electricity and gas in
terms of supplies. The actual and potential benefits for urban populations are only too evident.
It was with these deficiencies and benefits in mind, that the WEC Group of central and eastern
Europe decided at its meeting in Buenos-Aires on 19 October 2001 to organise a
Workshop on the restructuring and privatisation
of district heating and combined heat and power production
in central and eastern Europe: towards local energy systems.
Its focus was to be on the institutional aspects of reforms, rather than the technical ones.
Thanks to the kind invitation of the Romanian Member Committee of the WEC, the
Workshop was held in Neptun (Romania) on 10 June 2002, discussed a number of papers and
adopted a Declaration, for transmission to the Governments of the region.
This volume brings together these documents. It is my hope that they will contribute to the
emergence of sustainable local energy systems in central and eastern Europe. The papers,
however, are the responsibility of the individual authors and do not represent an official WEC
position on this subject.
As Chairman of the Group it remains for me to thank all those who have contributed to the
Workshop and report: Prof. A. Leca, as Chairman of the Romanian Member Committee of the
WEC and Chairman of the Workshop, Witold Cherubin, the General Rapporteur of the
Workshop, Dr. Klaus Brendow, the WEC Co-ordinator for central and eastern Europe, for his
persistence in obtaining and assembling the documents and his excellent editing work, the
authors of papers and the WEC London Office for its support.

that district heating and co-generation plants absorb 39 % of primary energy supplies3,

I. GOVERNMENTS
A. with regard to DH/CHP policies generally
recognize district heating (DH) and combined heat and power (CHP) systems
- as important for the well-being of the population
- as important components of the national energy economy, comparable to gas and
electricity
- as a means to reduce pollution and attain CO2 reduction targets
- as a means to absorb unemployment and enhance skills
encourage access to capital markets by initiating or accelerating the process of
restructuring, price liberalization, decentralization and, possibly, privatization of DH and
CHP companies, bearing in mind that several ownership and management models can
apply;
encourage pilot projects, pending the implementation of systemic and nation-wide
DH/CHP policies; such pilot or island projects would address isolated local systems in
their entirety or parts of systems (small-scale generation, pipeline rehabilitation, end-use
efficiency, metering, );
increase the role of local authorities in the development of local energy systems
B. with regard to financing
encourage foreign investments in granting national or most-favored nation status, without
exception, and secure a predictable legislative and regulatory framework;
encourage third-party financing of DH/CHP investments (performance contracting), joint
implementation and emission trading;
eliminate old debt, thus enabling a fresh start of the DH/CHP industries;
compensate for foregone revenues of DH/CHP companies as a result of applying special
heat tariffs for the poor;
recognize the social and economic implications of heat supply and, were necessary, grant
well targeted and transparent subsidies for a limited period of time, financed from public
budgets;
C. with regard to regulation
establish an independent regulatory body for, inter alia, granting licenses, determining
heat supply tariffs for captive customers, access to grids, and metering and billing
procedures; this regulatory body should cover all grid-based energies so as to secure a
common competitive framework;
divest these functions to the extent possible to the local authorities;
eliminate preferential pricing, taxation and regulatory regimes for competing fuels
choose the type of access to grids according to local circumstances (third party access,
single buyer principle, economic merit order );
eliminate progressively cross-subsidies between households and industrial consumers,
and between categories of industrial customers
promote
= fair rules for the allocation of costs and benefits from co-generation to electricity and heat
prices respectively, if markets for electricity and heat operate under different regulatory
regimes
= the transparency of tariffs
= improved services to customers (installation of meters, insulation, use-related billing)
= building codes, energy auditing
= EU/IEA-compatible statistics on heat generation, transmission and use
II. MUNICIPALITIES
develop economic, long-term plans, based on community needs, considering DH/CHP as
integrated part of local energy systems using gas, coal, refuse or renewables and
promoting insulation, the rational use of heat, co-generation and, where appropriate small,
decentralized plants;
encourage effective multi-fuel competition on the local energy market and the
liberalization of energy prices generally;
arbitrate the long-term development of grid-based energies (heat, gas, electricity) on the
basis of life cycle cost;
abstain from operational activities, rather entrust the ownership or management of
DH/CHP companies to the private sector, in particular energy service or multi-fuel
companies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2
DH/CHP  an important energy service
A heritage of central planning, district heating (DH) and combined heat and power generation
(CHP) are an important component of the energy economies in central and eastern Europe, comparable to gas and electricity. On average, they provide some 60 % of buildings with heat
and warm water, - a world record. Not surprisingly, they absorb an important share of primary
energy: 39 %. This is mostly gas (54 %), followed by coal (36 %), fuel oil (9 %) and nuclear
and renewables/waste with 1 % each. The share of CHP in total heat supply ranges from 37 %
(Russia) to 96 % (Slovakia).
II. The issue  revitalising an ailing industry

hence: lack of capital for repairs, meters
3. poses governance problems
while a local service, the sector is (still) determined by national policy (licensing, tariffs, fuel use)
at presently prevailing losses, CHP may not be rational in terms of energy use in comparison with direct use
of gas or electricity
in CHP, the competitiveness of heat versus electricity output is biased (allocation of overheads, cross
subsidies) in countries where electricity and heat markets are under different regulatory regimes
gas/electricity industry restructuring models cannot be replicated; access to grids must be structured and
regulated according to local circumstances (Third Party Access, Single Buyer, economic merit order )
4. and in not economically sustainable
insufficient investments/incentives to enhance efficiency
no full cost accounting and allocation
no optimisation of local energy systems (= multi-fuel competition on the basis of life cycle cost)
In several countries, the rise of tariffs and the distortion of gas and electricity prices for
households resulted in a tendency to disconnect from DH systems and to prefer individual
prepared by Dr. K. Brendow, Geneva, KBrendow@compuserve.com
heating based on natural gas and electricity. In the same way, CHP growth was affected by
distorted gas prices.
III.
Measures taken or contemplated
The DH/CHP industries in central and eastern Europe had to await progress in the reform of
the electric power industry (to which they were and are closely linked), before they saw their
problems addressed by policy makers. Restructuring policies follow five lines of action:
1. from centralised public systems to a range of decentralized ownership and
management models
such as municipal agencies, limited liability companies, joint stock companies, public/private
partnerships, ESCOs, industrial self-producers
privatisation is heralded as a means to access the capital market and expertise,
but impeded by old debt, receivables and political interference in tarification and investments
2. from vertical integration to unbundling and competition
towards separation of generators and distributors even though this may complicate system
operation
third party access to heat distribution grids is not practiced
competition from gas
3. from subsidized, lump-sum tariffs to full-cost, metered tariffs
despite substantial increases of heat prices, full cost coverage and elimination of producer
subsidies has been attained only in the Baltic States
implications of tariff rises: social hardships, payment arrears, surge of self-production, surge of
peak demand for electricity and disconnection from DH systems
cross-subsidization still prevails between industrial and residential, and small and big industrial
customers
4. from ad hoc decisions to internationally compatible legislation
everywhere laws have now been enacted on energy, environment and efficiency
in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania exist specific DH/CHP laws
everywhere regulatory authorities exist (national, provincial or municipal) to deal with DH/CHP
o licensing
o tariffs
o development planning
o incentives for renewables, co-generation and efficiency improvement (audit,
building codes)
policies aim at approximation to EU policies and standards
the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty on non-discrimination of foreign investors (land
ownership, concessions, licenses, dispute settlement) are applied except in Bulgaria
assistance through Phare, USAID, IBRD, EBRD
5. from DH-specific policies to local energy systems
Poland and Romania oblige municipalities to develop policies for local energy system
These policies are driven by the assessment that efficient district heating systems are the most
environmentally friendly and convenient solution for the urban community compared with
other options. Therefore, Governments support district heating and CHP. At the same time,
the liberalisation of energy markets, biased price relations and competition from gas require
DH/CHP operators to re-design systems, reduce losses and costs and improve customer
service and image. The quest for fresh capital and expertise through privatisation has proved
difficult as long as restructuring had not been completed. Not all operators will survive this
process without government subsidies, with mergers offering some relief. These dilemmas
point to the need for long-term planning of local energy systems offering an equal level
playing field for all sources of energy and energy efficiency measures based not so much on
volatile price relations but on life-cycle cost.
CASE STUDIES
These are the general issues and conclusions emanating from case studies for Belarus,
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Romania,
Russia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and from a foreign investor.
Some national features may be highlighted to complement the general messages:
in Belarus, DH/CHP remains operated centrally; households cover only 10 % of costs
in Bulgaria, producer subsidies will have been withdrawn by about 2005; dual tariffs (for capacity and
use) are advocated to improve payment discipline
in the Czech Republic, heat supply is decentralized, but suffers from cross subsidies in favour of gas
and electricity for small consumers; a cost-effectiveness audit is required for new or rehabilitated CHP
projects
in Estonia, there are no subsidies for heat suppliers, but well for low-income customers
In Hungary, the District Heating Law stipulates that household customers can only cancel a heat supply
contract if all flat users (owners) concur; full metering should be attained by 2005, with estimated
savings of 15  25 %
in Latvia, most DH facilities are owned by municipalities; privatisation is hampered by receivables, old
debt and insolvency
in Lithuania, a first effort at privatising Kaunas CHP on the basis of a lease agreement failed for lack
of compliance of bidders with the terms of the tender; in 2001 another tender was launched by way of
selling assets
in Macedonia, the privatisation of the DH company serving Skopje was successfully launched on the
basis of a workers-buy out, with shares now traded on the stock market
in Poland, about 3000 companies supply heat to customers; the major issue is the setting of prices
below cost thereby impeding competition and market entry of private investors
in Romania, losses exceed 50 %; DH and CHP plants have been decentralized as part of a restructuring
strategy aimed at reducing the number of operators, attracting private capital and forming public-private
partnerships; old debt has been eliminated or postponed; three agencies regulate the grid-based energies
in Russia, CHP saves 15 mill. t of oil equivalent per year; small wood- or peat-based cogeneration units
of 0.3  6 MW capacity are now available to serve small, remote cities
in Slovakia 1200 heat suppliers operate, with a tendency towards mergers; heat supply subsidies for
households would in principle cover the difference between costs and tariffs if they were actually and
regularly paid
in Slovenia, CHP is expected to contribute, by 2010, to the major part of a doubling of electricity
production from plants with high efficiency or utilising waste or renewable sources
a German investor holds, among other things, that a full acquisition of DH/CHP assets should be at the
conclusion of a long-term partnership with municipalities on tariffs and payment arrears, not the
beginning.
Whatever the difficulties and particularities mentioned: everywhere, a reliable, transparent
and predictable regulatory framework is heralded as the main avenue to guide the DH/CHP
industry in central and eastern Europe through restructuring and decentralization towards
business-like operation and integration into competitive local energy markets. Developing
such a framework is an issue in itself. It is therefore not surprising that the WEC Group
Central and Eastern Europe has, therefore, established a Task Force on DH/CHP Regulations
to identify problems and suggest solutions.
General Report
PRESENT SITUATION AND CURRENT TRENDS
IN RESTRUCTURING THE DISTRICT HEATING SECTOR
IN POLAND AND OTHER CEE COUNTRIES
by Witold Cherubin MSc. Mech. Eng 3
SUMMARY
The report describes the present situation of the DH/CHP sector in Poland and nine other CEE countries
(Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Slovakia) resulting from
the transformation process (changes of economic system, ownership, pricing etc). The paper reviews existing
legislation, energy policy and pricing problems, energy market liberalization and trends in DH sector
restructuring. It concludes with recommendations to governments and municipalities.
1. INTRODUCTION
Heat supply is an important sector of the energy economy in Poland and other CEE countries.
In Poland approximately 50% of primary energy is used for heating purposes in all heat
consuming sectors, and approximately 80% of energy consumption in the buildings is
constituted by central heating and domestic warm water. The share of the DH sector in the
heat market in the 10 CEE countries is shown in Table 1:

Russia
Slovakia
It is necessary to stress, that DH systems are in fact heat carrier distribution systems, because
heat can be produced with different technologies and fuels. Hard coal is the main fuel for CHP
and DH plants in Poland, but for small heat production more and more gas and oil is used. In
other CEE countries, the structure of primary energy is different, the main fuels are usually
natural gas and heavy oil and, in some countries, lignite, wood and peat are used in CHP and
DH plants. Therefore, DH systems are strongly connected with other energy sectors (power,
gas, coal, oil) as well as local energy resources (geothermal, industrial waste heat, refuse,
wood etc.). The scope of DH systems is local, but they play an important role in the national
economy. They suffer from a number of failures of the centrally planned economy, leading to
inefficiencies and waste of energy. In the past, the DH sector in Poland was composed of 51
vertically integrated state-owned monopolies operating in a whole province (or parts of it) or in
a large city.
The past investment and energy policy in Poland resulted in relatively low efficiency of heat
production and distribution, much higher heat losses in buildings than in Western countries, a
lack of correlation between prices and costs, and subsidies from the state budget. The situation
was similar in other CEE countries.

2. PRESENT SITUATION IN THE DH SECTOR
After the victory of the Solidarity movement in Poland, fundamental changes started in the
entire national economy, including the energy sector and DH systems. In 1990, the Parliament
issued important acts, which created a legal base for ownership changes in the DH sector,
shifting the responsibility for heat supply to local authorities. Unfortunately, till 1997, energy
sector activity remained regulated by old legislation, issued in the past economic system and
inadequate in the new social and economic situation. This was a serious obstacle for energy
sector transformation Nevertheless; the transfer of ownership and changes in the organization
of heat supply began in the majority of cities. Organizational and legal forms in the DH sector
differ:
communal budgetary unit and enterprise not transformed into a Commercial Code-based
company,
limited liability company owned by the municipality, jointly with private entities or
companies,
joint stock company owned by municipalities, together with private entities or companies
(some of them privatized by the issuing of communal bonds or sale of shares on the stock
exchange),
private company owned by private entities (some operate DH plants and networks leased
from municipalities, but few private firms own DH assets).
Companies usually operate DH system in a single city (or part of it), but there are also
companies, which operate several DH plants and networks in different cities situated in one or
a number of provinces.
This process is not finished yet and organizational forms are still changing. The most
important of which is the ongoing privatization of CHP and DH companies, usually through
the sale of shares, or through tenders intended to sell small DH systems as a whole. It is worth
stressing, that today not only foreign, but also Polish investors participate in the privatization
of DH systems.
The organization and ownership of DH systems in the nine other CEE countries differ. In
some countries, DH system ownership is decentralized (owned mainly by municipalities) and
this process deepens, while in others centralized large heat suppliers owned by the State (socalled concerns etc.) still exist. A short description of the organization and ownership of DH
systems in Poland and nine other CEE countries is given in Table 2.
It has to be underlined that changes in ownership and organization are only the beginning of
DH sector restructurization. This process also includes economic transformation, related
technical activities aiming at energy use effectiveness, decrease of environmental pollution,
increase of quality and reliability of heat supply, customer services etc. A crucial parameter
for the economic transformation is pricing, because in the past heat prices were extremely low.
Consumers covered only a small portion of heat production and transmission costs; thus, the
DH sector was subsidized. The change of the economic system (including reduction of
subsidies) caused a rapid increase of heat prices and an economic shock to heat consumers,
especially households (in 1990 alone: 10-times increase from 970 to 9 700 PLZ/GJ). Then
standard (maximum) heat prices for households (see table 3) and heat price increases for other
consumers were limited by the Ministry of Finance (or Council of Ministries) until end 1998.
Heat prices rose often several times a year.
Customer payments for heat delivery were calculated in the past not on a basis of measured
heat consumption, but as a lump sum (per m2, per person etc.). During the last three years a
great effort (financial and organizational) has been made to equip thousands of substations
with heat meters in all Polish DH systems. A similar situation exists in other CEE countries,
in some of them heat supply measurements will be implemented in the nearest future.

In 1995 7% VAT has been included into the price, in 1996 = 12 %, in 1997 = 17 % and since 1998 = 22 %.
The rise of heat prices and the measuring of heat supply led to a significant decrease in heat
demand. Simultaneously, a decrease of heat consumption resulted from the reduction of
industrial activity. Some consumers (industrial and residential) disconnected their installations
from the DH network and build their own heat sources to avoid high heat supply costs. The
main competitors for DH systems in Poland and other CEE countries are separate gas heating,
local oil and gas fired boilers and in some countries electricity: However, it is necessary to
stress, that generally in CEE countries, there is no true competition in heat supply, because in
these countries artificially low prices of gas, electricity and oil still exist. On top of that,
increasing costs of heat and the low real income of the population weaken the tenants ability
to pay for heating and warm water; these costs add as much as 60% to accommodation-related
payments. The situation is serious in Bulgaria, where poor people reduce the number of
heated rooms by eliminating radiators in their flats; they depend on heat penetrating from
other flats. During cold days, they switch to electric heaters. In Poland that kind of tenants
activity stopped several years ago after the Supreme Court ruled that a radiator installed in a
flat belongs to the building owner (or all flat owners), and that the owner of the flat had no
right to remove a radiator without permission of the building owner. All these factors caused a
reduction of heat consumption, but in some CEE countries (e.g. Hungary) this process
concerns industrial consumers only and even an increase in CHP production is observed.
3. ENERGY POLICY AND LEGISLATION CONCERNING THE DH SECTOR
During the last ten years, the DH sector has been experiencing fundamental changes
introduced, both in Poland and other CEE countries, in response to national and international
developments.
In Poland, the most important national determinants include three policy documents: Strategy
for Poland, Industrial policy and Policy of housing development adopted by the
Parliament. In 1995, Parliament adopted two basic documents determining the framework for
restructuring specific energy sectors: Guidelines for the energy policy till 2010 and
Guidelines for the state policy regarding the rationalization of energy utilization in the living
and communal sector. In some other CEE countries (e.g. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia),
similar policy documents determining the main directions of energy sector development were
also issued.
But there were also a number of international obligations. The most important ones include
the European Energy Charter, European Treaty on Polish Association with the European
Communities and their Member States, and the European Energy Charter Treaty, as well as
bilateral agreements with different countries regarding the purchase and transmission of
energy carriers, implementation of joint energy investments etc. Additionally, for candidate
countries for EU membership, conformity of legislation with EU standards is required.
Simultaneously, due to the fact that particular elements of DH systems are owned by different
entities and that heat is produced from different heat sources, the restructuring of the DH
sector is quite a complex process. Thus, the implementation of this process needed a principal
change of the old legislation in favor of a market oriented economic framework.
In Poland, the transformation was initiated by the Energy Law of 1997 (EL), which deals
with security of national energy supplies, efficient and rational use of energy and fuels,
utilization of renewable energy, promotion of competition, protection of consumer interests
and minimization of costs. It has to be underlined, however, that the implementation of this
law was possible only after several dozen ordinances had been issued. These ordinances
entered into force in the years 1998-1999. They determined detailed rules for energy company
operations in a market-oriented economy, conditions for connection to networks, transmission
service rules (including TPA) as well as principles of tariff setting, settlements with customers
etc.
The EL with its secondary legislation has determined a new quality of operational rules for
DH companies acting in the market economy. The heat network is, however, a natural
monopoly and monopolistic structures of heat production and distribution need to be adapted
to the requirements of customers and price and cost regulations determined by the market. It
means that if energy (including heat) is supplied from a network, market forces are not
functioning and should be replaced by an independent authority, balancing interests of
suppliers and customers. Thus the EL defines limits for production, transformation, storage,
transmission and distribution as well as energy and fuels turnover, for which a license is
required. According to the EL, the Energy Regulatory Authority (ERA) has been established
in Poland as a central state administration regulating activities of the energy sector. The tasks
of ERA include among others: licensing, approving and controlling energy prices, arbitration
of specified disputes between suppliers and consumers etc. Special consideration should be
given to the fact, that the EL regulates problems of development planning of transmission and
distribution companies and of local municipalities. According to the EL, supervision of the
development planning of power and gas networks is performed by ERA, while heat supply
planning is coordinated by territorial self-government and voivodes, since heat supply
planning is the task of the municipalities. The EL imposes an obligation on municipalities to
determine guidelines for the local supply of energy (heat, power and gas). Since 1997, the EL
has been changed several times, either to improve a specific provision or to adjust a provision
to some modified economic or organizational conditions. The last amendment in 2000
required several ordinances to be replaced by new ones and an ordinance to be issued
regulating principles of obligatory electricity and heat purchase from non-conventional and
renewable sources, and electricity produced in cogeneration with heat.
At the moment, there is no dedicated program or action plan referring to energy efficiency,
but the mechanisms of rational energy conversion and utilization are included in the Energy
Policy Guidelines until 2020 as an important issue of energy policy. The promotion of energy
efficient technologies and equipment is listed as an important instrument for implementing
this strategy. The Government will perform this policy through direct measures (regulations),
economic and fiscal instruments (low interest loans, grants, taxes etc.) as well as through
supporting instruments (information, education, R&D). The Guidelines also make the
integrated management of energy and environment a strategic direction for the country. The
integrated strategy will be executed on the base of co-operation between the Ministry of
Economy and the Ministry of Environment. The States environment goals are formulated in
the Ecological Policy of Poland. The Ministry of Environment, responsible for environment
protection will co-operate with the Ministry of Economy in the area of matters referring to the
energy sector. Environmental protection problems and energy sector activities are treated
jointly by several Acts concerning protection and forming of natural environment (1980),
physical planning (1994), building (1994), geology and mining (1994) and the EL (1997).
There is a policy of supporting renewable energies and other investments connected with
environmental protection (including reduction of emissions from heat sources). In addition,
the Act on Support for Thermo-Modernization Investment of 1998 creates the basis for energy
saving projects in housing (all forms of ownership) and public buildings owned by
municipalities. These investments concern heating plants up to 11.6 MWth , DH networks and
buildings connected to these networks. An expert institution must positively evaluate the
project. Commercial credit with maximum 7 years pay-back period from savings resulting
from the project is the basis of investment financing. Energy audit, completion of the project
on time and repayment of 75% of the credit are the conditions for obtaining the remaining
25% of the credit as an incentive premium. The promotion of modern, highly effective
equipment and technologies will form an important element of the energy efficiency
improvement strategy. According to the EL, energy labeling of selected groups of household
appliances is regulated by the Ministry of Economy (labels must comply with EU
regulations).
While describing energy policy and legislation in Poland it is necessary to stress that there is
no universal rule solving all energy problems in different countries. Every country tries to find
its specific solution for assuring energy security and economic development, as well as
environmental protection. Although there is no universal energy policy for CEE countries,
there are some common features and similar systemic and legislative solutions. A short
description of the energy policy and legislation in nine CEE countries is given below:
3.1 Belarus
In Belarus, energy policy consists of a number of energy saving programs, which are
coordinated and promoted by the Committee for Energy Conservation (CEC). There is a
regulation coordinating the relationship between producers, suppliers and consumers of
district heating. Unfortunately, other specific legislation or regulations concerning DH and
CHP are still to come. All investments aiming at modernization and all energy saving
programs are financed from different sources: the innovation funds of the concern
Belenergo and other enterprises, the energy savings fund of CEC, and national and local
budgets. There are two large heat producers in Belarus: concern Belenergo which owns 22
CHP plants, and 30 large (over 100 MWth) heating only boilers (HOB) and the Ministry of
Housing and Communal Services (MHCS) which owns 1 520 HOB plants and DH networks.
The activities of the CEC and MHCS are concentrated mainly on technical improvement of
DH systems and implementation of the energy conservation and modernization programs.
3.2 Bulgaria
In Bulgaria, energy policy priorities are to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy
consumption in energy-consuming industries, heat supply and the whole national economy.
In the strategy for the DH sector, priority is given to promote cogeneration, transfer DH
systems ownership from the State to communes, continue state control over DH companies by
a regulatory body and to finance important measures of DH systems development. The main
tasks are: arresting the declining share of industrial consumers, connecting new clients
(mainly to existing DH networks) and improving social support for poor families together
with the reduction of direct subsidies for heat suppliers. Reduction of huge heat losses in
panel buildings is also a serious task, and its optimal solution has been recently under
consideration. The Law for Energy and Energy Efficiency of 1999 deals with conditions for
the development and security of national energy supplies, efficient use of energy and energy
resources, development of a competitive energy market and energy sector privatization. The
aims of the Law are: integration with European energy systems and markets and creation of
conditions for rational coverage of energy demands (electricity, heat, gas and other fuels). The
Council of Ministers recently established the State Agency of Energy Efficiency, which
coordinates and promotes efficient use of energy and energy resources.
3.3 Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, energy policy is concentrated on more efficient utilization of primary
energy and environmental protection, including increased use of renewable fuels. The
Government takes also into account the social aspects and impact of energy prices on citizens
economic situation. Energy price deregulation was to be completed by 2002. However, there
are concerns that the deregulation of electricity and gas prices will not proceed as foreseen;
that energy savings will suffer from this decision; and that reforms will continue only slowly.
The Energy Management Act (EMA) of 2000 specifies rights and obligations in connection
with energy production, transmission and consumption and deals with more efficient energy
use, environment protection, reliable energy supply stimulation, promotion of competition and
sustainable development. The main principle followed by the new legislation is an obligation
to consider utilization of domestic fuels in new equipment.
The EMA introduced an obligation to conduct energy audits of all existing CHP plants and
organizations above a specified volume. Public sector organizations are obliged to implement
the audit results. The private sector is expected to cover the costs of both: the audit and its
implementation. For new CHP projects and rehabilitation of an existing source producing heat
or electricity alone (without cogeneration) a cost-effectiveness audit is obligatory. The CHP
scheme can be applied when the result of audit is positive and the long-term purchase of
power and heat is secured. These laws are in compliance with existing EU legislation and the
Energy Charter. There is an urgent need to create, on the basis of the EMA, longer-term
objectives for the energy sector requiring the best solution for energy supplies on the regional
level.
The Clean Air Act of 1991 sets different air pollution charges for sources of emission
depending on their size. Small plants (up to 50 kWth) operated by private persons (non
contractors) are not penalized. The Act on Environmental Impact Assessment of 1992 is
concerned with new plants and technologies, and the undertaking of an evaluation is a
prerequisite for granting permission to build a plant. For existing plants the Decree issued in
1997 by the Minister of the Environment specifies a list of air pollutants, emission limits and
other conditions for stationary sources of pollution and for protection of the environment, as
well as requirements for monitoring air pollutant emissions and the quality of fuels. The State
Fund of the Environmental promotes, by different means (including direct subsidies),
conversion of individual heat sources from solid fuels to natural gas.
3.4 Estonia
Estonia aims to bring its energy policy into line with EU requirements by emphasizing
abundant and low priced energy sources on an environmentally sustainable basis, as well as
securing domestic energy reserves (mainly oil shale). The energy policy will promote
decentralized production, including CHP. International cooperation should influence and
assist the achievement of these overall targets. The new Governments energy strategy
introduced in 1997 aims to meet prospective international environmental agreements. The
main target of the "Long-term National Development Plan for the Fuel and Energy Sector" of
1998 is "to provide stable and high quality energy supply to consumers with such a
development of the fuel and energy sector that GDP could be increased to the level necessary
for the accession to the EU". The Energy Act (EA) of 1997 regulates tasks of network
operators for power, heat, gas and liquid fuels. The EA distinguishes between fuel and energy
(heat and power) traders dominating the market and others.
According to the EA, energy companies must keep separate accounts for the production,
transmission, distribution and trade of fuel and energy. The third party access (TPA) principle
is "regulated", i.e. everybody can use the network after payment of a fixed rate, except for
negotiated rates for gas networks.
In 1998, the Energy Market Inspectorate (EMI) was created as a government agency within
the framework of the Ministry of Economy. Its main aims are the promotion of competition in
the energy market and the monitoring of its development. The tasks of EMI include licensing
and evaluation of tariffs (including scrutiny of rates for transmission and distribution).
Depending on the extent of the obligation to purchase energy from renewable sources, a
distribution network operator may apply to EMI for a reduction in the transmission or
transport rate applied by a transmission-network operator. EMI can also survey the financial
solidity of market actors, and intervene against predatory behavior, especially in the
monopolistic parts of the sector. The existing legislation is subject to change, as some items of
the act are still unclear, amongst others conditions for third party access to the energy market.
3.5 Hungary
In Hungary, energy policy in the DH sector is based on the District Heating Law (DHL) of
1998. According to the DHL, operation of DH systems supplying residential houses is
compulsory for municipalities, which may issue licenses to private companies to operate the
system or to keep the majority of shares of the DH company. Since 2001, favorable official
prices have been introduced for mandatory purchase of electricity generated by small powerplants (less than 20 MW). A new Electricity Law focusing on market liberalization and the
promotion of cogeneration has been discussed by the Parliament. Till July 2003, measurement
of heat supply will be a base for settlements with all consumers. It is agreed that the
maximum heat price should reflect the benefits offered by CHP in terms of energy savings
and environmental protection through cogeneration. Apart from that, the DHL states that
withdrawal from a heat supply contract in the residential sector is only allowed when all flat
users (owners) agree that replacing a heating system is not less effective than district heating.
There is no special legislation for energy conservation, but at the beginning of 2001 the
Government launched a national economy development program guided by the Ministry of
Economy. The program includes a wide range of energy conservation measures.
3.6 Latvia
In Latvia, energy policy is based on The Government's Policy in Energy Sector" of 1996,
which sets out the basic principles for the regulation in the energy sector and supports
privatization as a tool of efficiency and competitiveness improvement together with a
reduction of state interference. High priority is given to cogeneration, restructuring of DH
systems into joint stock firms with private participation. This is considered to be an important
measure for improving management and quality of services. The document also stresses the
importance of environmental issues.
The general policy in the DH sector is governed by the law on "State and Municipal Heating
Policy" of 1997, which states that efficient DH systems are considered to be the most
environmentally friendly and convenient solution for the community in comparison to other
options. Therefore, DH is a responsibility of the local government in each locality and is
strongly supported officially. The document stresses in particular the importance of
commercializing the DH systems - introduction of market principles with certain restrictions
if and when public interests are affected. There are incentives for municipalities to give up
direct economic activities related to heat generation, maintaining only control over
management as well as long term planning functions in the DH sector. In order to promote
this policy, it is envisaged to ensure stability of the legislative framework, stable tariffs,
improved discipline of payments, licensing and conditions for attracting capital.
Most DH systems are municipally owned with a very few exceptions. In many cases the
municipalities would be willing to discuss privatization, but the major problem is the financial
attractiveness of the companies (receivables, old debts, etc.). Municipally owned DH systems
are treated as the municipality itself and can not receive any loans without a guarantee from
the local government. Thus, even if the DH company is performing well, its ability to attract
financing may be limited by other municipal investment projects (e.g. water and sewage,
municipal waste). If such rules are in force, some advanced financing schemes (e.g. ESCO
type) may be developed. Commercial banks are very active within the energy sector and
leasing companies are becoming increasingly involved in financing of e.g. substations and
boilers. Energy efficiency investments are strongly supported and there are no obstacles for
the development of direct lending schemes or application of ESCO concepts. The Law on
Regulation of Business Activities in Energy Industries of 1995 determines certain powers and
duties of energy companies (including DH companies) in order to secure a continuous and
undisturbed supply of energy to consumers, encourage business in this field and ensure that
the energy supply complies with the national energy policy. The Law stipulates procedures
for energy sector regulation and for the energy companies of a specified size, which have to
obtain a license. The Energy Department in the Ministry of Economy (MoE) works out the
energy sector development concepts, manages and analyses the energy resource balance,
prepares draft internal agreements on energy issues, co-ordinates efficient use of energy
resources, analyses investment projects in energy and participates in the regulatory activities
concerning energy enterprises. The Energy Supply Regulation Board (ESRB) is a part of the
government administration operating under the supervision of the MoE. Its main tasks are
licensing, review and approval of tariffs calculated by energy enterprises, consumers
protection, promotion of competition in the energy sector, and development of the necessary
regulatory framework for the sector in general. The ESRB decisions are binding for all energy
supply enterprises. According to the Law, the ESRB may delegate some of its functions to
municipalities (by special authorization). Recently regulation of the heat supply was
effectively transferred to the municipalities, whereas the Board still retains its powers to
license DH companies and settle all disputes emerging with regard to district heating. Any
disputes arising in connection with district heating prices etc. between the municipality,
consumers and the DH company, are settled by the ESRB in the first instance.
3.7 Lithuania
In Lithuania, energy policy is based on the National Energy Strategy of 1999, whose main
goal is reliable and safe energy supply at least possible cost. The document advocates several
priorities including the increase of energy efficiency, improvement of management and
implementation of market principles in the energy sector, reduction of the negative impact
upon the environment, assurance of nuclear safety requirements, integration with energy
systems of the EU, as well as regional cooperation and collaboration. The strategy does not
contain any significant targets, but outlines broad policy objectives. It will supposedly remain
in place for the next 20 years, and be updated every 5 years. An Action Plan, which is
presently under discussion, will supplement it.
The Energy Law (EL) of 1995 was renewed and accepted by the Parliament in 2000. The EL
aims at achieving conformity with EU legislation and the requirements for EU accession.
There is an established framework, made more explicit in the respective laws on electricity,
gas and heat. The EL is very general in terms and gives broad guidelines, thus so far the only
existing legal basis for TPA is the ratification of the Energy Charter. However, TPA is
applied in practice because Russia sells electricity to the Kaliningrad enclave through the
Lithuanian grid.
The laws on heat and gas date from 2001. Liberalization of the gas market is provided for in
the gas law in accordance with EU requirements. Power sector restructuring and privatization
has not been easy, and the government wants to keep control over companies considered to be
of strategic importance. One of the serious problems is the future of the Ignalina nuclear
power plant, which the EU wants to have shut down. The conventional thermal power plants
are based on different kinds of fuel (gas, heavy oil etc.) and do not depend on a single source.
The final choice for the replacement of the first unit of Ignalina will depend on further least
costs analysis and feasibility studies including other economic, financial and environmental
aspects.
There is no specific legislation for cogeneration. When it comes to the power sector, at
present the Lithuanian Energy Company (LEC) should remain in majority state ownership,
but it is envisaged to carry out a separation of sale and distribution operations and to establish
independent distribution companies. In the long term, LEC will become the transmission
system operator.
The Ministry of Economy is responsible for the energy sector, but responsibility for DH
sector restructurization has almost totally devolved to other entities. The Ministry is relying
on the Lithuanian Energy Agency, which was brought into existence to help prepare new
legislation and to gather information on the energy sector in general. Until the end of 1996,
any rulings on tariff policy have been subject to direct approval by the central government,
but since the State Control Commission of Prices for Energy Resources and Energy Activities
was established, that body regulates the tariff policy.
3.8 Russia
In Russia, energy policy is based on two main documents: the Energy Strategy of Russia of
1994 and the Main directions of the energy policy of the period till 2010 of 1995, which
state that energy is an important factor of both economic development and improved quality
of life. The main goals of energy policy are to determine the optimal conditions for efficient
energy production and consumption together with significant reduction of their negative
impact upon the environment, as well as to preserve and strengthen energy independence.
Energy conservation is estimated to enable a 15-20% reduction in harmful atmospheric
pollution. Energy systems will be used as the most important means of integration of the
different regions of Russia and the CIS member countries.
The goal of energy strategy is also a radical reduction in the use of materials, labor and
natural resources to satisfy the needs of society with regard to energy. Saved energy resources
should ensure increased energy exports. The Federal Law on Energy Saving of 1996 creates
economic and organizational conditions for an effective use of energy resources including
energy efficiency standards, equipment certification and metering as well as the State
promotion of energy efficiency by means of economic and financial measures of energy
savings and education and training in the efficient use of energy resources. In 1998, the
Federal program Energy Conservation of Russia was approved, whose main objective is
the implementation of tasks laid out in the Main directions of 1995. It should bring savings
of fuels and energy resources up to 365-435 Mtoe till 2005 and decrease energy intensity of
GDP by 13.5%, as well as reduce budgetary subsidies for fuels and energy supply by reducing
the prices and tariffs for energy carriers. The programs concerning energy efficiency in
general rely on external financing, thus modernization of several DH installations will be
financed by World Bank loans.
The energy policy is an attempt to replace the centralized structures of the Soviet Union with
more flexible ones, but direct state intervention is still a dominating factor in the energy
sector. A more stable energy market by creation of a more independent energy regulatory
body is considered together with differentiated tariffs for gas and electricity implementation,
development of more friendly conditions for investors and privatization of the pipeline
monopoly for oil transport (Transneft) and the large holding company Unified Power System
of Russia (UPSR).
The holding UPSR founded in 1992, is the main actor in the power sector, generating and
transmitting by far the largest share of electricity. The UPSR operates a number of CHP
plants, whereas HOB plants and DH distribution networks are managed and operated locally,
by communes. As the UPSRs main responsibility is electricity production in large
condensing power plants it is not particularly concerned with the role of CHP production.
While major DH/CHP systems are owned by power utilities within UPSR, the DH
distribution networks connected to the transmission networks supplied from the CHP plants
are mostly owned by the municipalities, which complicates the organizational conditions for
technologically integrated DH/CHP systems. How to define the ownership related to DH/CHP
systems is currently under discussion. Also some industrial CHP are owned and operated by
different factories, but their share in heat and power generation is rather small (3-5% of
electricity and 7-9% of district heat).
Centralization is still the dominating style of management in the DH sector with few
possibilities of co-ordination between the DH networks and CHP producers in long term
development planning. At the same time, responsibility for heat supply was relegated from the
central government to the regional and local authorities. The Federal Authorities have
withdrawn from direct responsibilities, especially investments, and are now preoccupied with
establishing of a legal framework for the energy sector.
The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is responsible for elaboration of an energy policy draft and
simultaneously for implementation of this policy in the oil, gas, coal and non-nuclear power
sector as well as energy efficiency and renewables. The nuclear power generation remains the
responsibility of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, which also covers military aspects of nuclear
energy. Moreover the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Science and Technology and
Russian Energy Efficiency Union, Center for Energy Efficiency and other institutions linked
with the Ministry of Fuel and Energy are active in the area of DH sector and energy
efficiency. Environmental matters are regulated by the Federal Law on environmental
protection of 1993, Regulations on the environmental impact assessment of 1994, Federal
law on ecological examination of 1995 and other legislation which incorporate environmental
requirements for designing, constructing, locating and commissioning of industrial
enterprises, including heat sources.
3.9 Slovakia
Slovakia has set policy objectives for energy efficiency and conservation, which include
reduction of energy demand for space heating in the residential sector, promotion and
reinforcement of use of renewable energy sources, adjustment of energy prices so as to reflect
real costs as well as modernization and application of modern technologies. The Energy
Management Act (EMA) defines the rights and duties of various actors as well as terms and
conditions for economic activity in the power, gas and heat supply sectors, including
efficiency. The aim of the EMA is to guide the energy sector into a market oriented system in
line with EU standards. The EMA sets restrictive measures for crisis situations, and measures
for preventing critical situations in the energy industries, including terms of state intervention
as well as defining terms for supervision of the energy market.
For the heat supply sector, the EMA defines fundamental terms and conditions for regulation
of heat supply, heat purchase and measurement, including principles of dealing with illegal
heat use.
The Ministry of Economy, and especially its Energy Policy Department and Department of
Power and Heat Supply are responsible for enforcement of energy conservation measures.
However, operative responsibilities are under the specialized agencies. The Slovak Energy
Inspectorate (SEI) acts as a regulatory body on technical matters, while the Slovak Energy
Agency (SEA) acts as a research, consulting and commercial auditing agency. Besides the
energy efficiency programmes administered by SEA, the Ministry of Economy administers
also two energy efficiency programmes. The EMA established a clear division of tasks
between these two bodies. In 2001, the Act on the Efficient Utilization of Energy (AEUE) was
accomplished. The AEUE aims at the realization of the substantial scope for energy saving in
the domestic and industrial sectors. It provides for energy audits and introduces an obligation
for big energy consumers to have an energy manager. Moreover, the AEUE foresees the
creation of an Energy Revolving Fund, aimed at financing energy efficiency and renewable
energy projects. The effective implementation of the new energy legislation remains however
hindered by lack of secondary legislation, specifying implementation procedures for the
newly adopted EMA and AEUE Acts.
Environmental matters are regulated by defining emission standards for SO2, NOx, CO and
dust for existing plants, as well as requirements for new emission sources commissioned after
1998. There are roughly 3,100 heat sources, of which approximately 1,300 CHP or HOB
plants are connected to the DH networks. These heat sources are operated by approx. 1,200
DH utilities. The remaining 1,800 heat sources are block boilers in buildings. Heat sources
and DH network are owned by Slovenske Elektrarne (join-stock company owned by the
State), Western Slovakia Distribution Company and Central Slovakia Distribution Company
(both are state-owned enterprises), by mostly municipal and district companies as well as
private companies, building management associations etc.. Since 1992, the role of
municipalities has become much more important in the heat supply sector. They frequently
own heat sources and heat networks, however they do not undertake economic activities
themselves. In most cases, municipalities sign contracts (like Energy Performance
Contracting) with private companies.
4. PRICING AND TAXATION IN ENERGY SECTOR
In the past, heat prices in Poland were determined with customers on a contractual basis, or as
official standard prices in relation to households (including one-family houses). Till the end of
1997, the price level did not depend on local conditions and heat supply costs, because the
Ministry of Finance determined the official heat prices for the housing sector as a standard
price for the whole country. At the same time, till the end of 1998, different forms of state
limitations on contracted prices existed, which meant that these prices were also under the
control of the Ministry of Finance or Council of Ministries. For that time, the development
and modernization of DH systems could be financed only by net profit and depreciation
allowances, which was not sufficient to finance the necessary investments. As a result,
investments in the DH sector have been financed mainly by the State and local budgets
including subsidies for DH companies (later for housing co-operatives). It has to be
underlined that pricing and investment financing in the DH sector had a direct influence on
the technical and economic condition of the companies. In particular, their technical,
economic and organizational restructuring was impeded.
A similar situation prevailed in other energy sectors, because the State fixed low prices of
coal, electricity and gas and subsidized energy enterprises or whole branches of industry (e.g.
coal). From 1989/90, prices of heat and other energy carriers were systematically increased.
In the years 1995-1997, assets were re-evaluated, but this did not lead to prices which covered
costs. According to the Energy Law of 1997, the principles of electricity, gas and heat price
calculation changed completely. Recently it has become possible to include into a price not
only the running costs, but also justified costs connected with the financing of development,
modernization and environmental protection. Unfortunately, however, major obstacles for the
rapid implementation of that principle are the low purchasing power of the population and the
necessity of adapting fuels and energy prices to the general economic conditions of the
country. It should be stressed that the significantly low revenues of Polish families have to be
taken into consideration in pricing policy, because the share of energy costs in household
budgets is much more higher than in EU countries (about 11 % in Poland against average
approx. 4 % in EU).
In Poland, prices of energy carriers are approaching a rational (ie. cost-reflective) level.
However, this process together with the growth of different fuels and energy prices has to be
adjusted to the social, political and economic situation of the country so as not to cause costly
social tension or an excessive increase in costs of production and services. Different paths of
price increase and regulation have been adopted for the coal, oil, power, gas and heat. Today,
market forces regulate only oil prices. In coal mining, a special program of restructuring is
being implemented and coal prices are getting closer to cost-reflective prices. However, this
process is connected with many economic, social and even political problems, since coal was
in the past the Polish gold and was characterized by high costs of mining and low price both
for domestic use and export. Electricity, heat (since 1999) and gas (from 2000) prices are
regulated by ERA. Accordingly the secondary legislation to the Energy Law initial tariffs for
gas and electricity protected consumers against high prices. Charges for gas could not
increase by more than 12.5%, and similarly, the increase of electricity prices was limited to
13% for households. It was also limited for industrial customers; here, the high diversity of
energy consumption resulted in very diverse increases for specific customers.
In the DH sector, in theory, market prices have been introduced, but for the initial tariff, the
increase of the heat price was limited to 15% (excluding companies with apparent losses on
heat sales). Currently the existing pricing system in the energy sector does not encourage real
competition, because for social and political reasons, the levels of gas, power and heat prices
are administratively restricted. According to the Energy policy guidelines to 2020, a transition
period will permit an evolutionary process towards appropriate relative prices in the energy
sector. Therefore, in relation to those groups of customers, who benefit from crosssubsidization (at the cost of other customers), it is possible, for a few years, to increase prices
to a level only a few percents higher than inflation. At the same time, there is a social fund
supporting poor households (including for heating). In 2000, some changes in the provisions
concerning pricing and customer settlement rules were adopted. The changes are mainly
aimed at increasing the impact of tariffs on the rational use of heat; in the past, fixed charges
determined as much as 70% of total customer charges. Thus, consumers had no economic
incentive for rational energy use. According to the last amendments of the Energy Law, fixed
charges for heat and transmission services may constitute only 30% of total services charges.
Recently, the problem of heat price increase affected the activities of foreign investors.. In
several places these investors offered the rehabilitation of municipal DH systems as an ESCO
company. Usually oil or gas fired boilers were fitted, which sometimes caused a quick rise in
heat prices (even doubling). Conflicts arose between municipalities and consumers who were
not able to pay. Sometimes investors interrupted heat supply and quarrels have to be
adjudicated by ERA or civil courts.
Based on Polish experience, it can be stated, that the problem of energy pricing, especially
in the DH sector, is probably the most sensitive element (in its economic and socio-political
aspects) in the process of transition from centrally planned to market oriented economy.
This problem is solved in the various CEE countries in different ways, as briefly described in
Table 4.

A description of the tariffs setting and subsidising system in nine CEE countries is given
below:
4.1 Belarus
Belarus is a country, where the Government regulates fuel prices and energy tariffs. Recent
heat prices of households reflect only around 10% of actual production costs. To compensate
unprofitable heat supply to the residential sector, heat prices for industry are cost-reflective
and include some profit. Thus, DH is not attractive for industrial consumers who in some
cases build their own HOB plant to reduce costs of heat supply. DH companies are operating
with very low profit or even losses. Additionally, the average payment collection rate in 1999
was about 87% of the amount billed. An additional problem is connected with the
methodology of cost distribution in CHP between heat and power production. At present, all
benefits of co-generation are allocated to the electricity side, so electricity is very cheap while
heat is as expensive as that produced in HOB plants. There are no special energy taxes but
energy producers pay a tax for harmful gas emissions and a 20% value added tax (VAT).
Fines are also imposed if the emission of harmful gases exceeds certain limits.
4.2 Bulgaria
Bulgaria established at the end of 1999 the State Commission of Energy Regulation (SCER),
whose activities comprise licensing, quality control and safety production, transmission and
supply of electricity, heat and natural gas, as well as the regulation of electricity, heat and
natural gas prices as calculated by the producers, transmission and distribution companies,
including DH enterprises. Prices of heat supplied to households from DH systems are still
subsidized by the state budget, in contrast to heat prices for industrial consumers, which are
cost-reflective and include a 20% profit margin. The heat price for households was kept
constant from October 1999 to mid 2001 and then increased, according to the agreement with
the International Monetary Fund.
4.3 Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, heat prices are regulated by the State. The economic situation of heat
producers is difficult because costs increase resulting from requirements of environmental
protection, while income from heat supplies is limited. Simultaneously, gas and electricity
both enjoy cross subsidy by way of higher industrial prices and low prices for the population
at large. Under these circumstances, competition of DH companies on the heat market is
difficult. It is expected that before accession to the EU, prices in the energy sector will be
reasonably cost-reflective with respect to consumer segments. Recently, electricity and gas
prices include 22% and heat prices 5% VAT.
4.4 Estonia
Estonia has different mechanisms of energy price formation in each specific field. There are
no direct subsidies for fuel, electricity or heat. For petroleum products, a free market exists
since several years. In the natural gas sector (the only supplier is Russia), prices for small
customers (households, non-industrial use) are regulated by the Energy Market Inspectorate
(EMI). Large gas users have to negotiate their prices with the Estonian Gas Company.
In the DH sector, municipalities determine prices, and those are differentiated. Crosssubsidization still exists in some cases, between industry and households, but this is quickly
changing. The housing cost subsidy system exists in Estonia to support low-income families
and to cover housing costs, including for space heating and fuel for cooking. This subsidy is
based on "normal costs" and is paid to families with housing costs exceeding 30% of their
monthly income. Also a 0% VAT was applied for households, as an exemption to the VAT
Act which introduced 5% VAT in 2000, with planned increase to 18% in the following years.
There are no special energy taxes in Estonia. An additional fiscal tax is applied to liquid fuels.
4.5 Hungary
Hungary also has different mechanisms for energy pricing in gas, power and heat sectors.
Cross-financing elements of the official energy price system are disadvantageous for district
heating. The actual gas price system includes social elements by cross-subsidizing small
consumers at the detriment of the big ones. Price-wise, electricity is preferred to heat from
CHP and up to the end of 2000 high voltage power production was promoted against the low
voltage. In 2001, favorable official prices have been introduced for mandatory purchase of
electricity from small power plants (below 20 MW). The new Electricity law discussed in
2001 by the Parliament should give a better chance for cogeneration. Also in the DH sector,
there exists cross subsidizing between small and big industrial consumers. Unfortunately
today heat prices are relatively high in comparison to individual gas heating, but this is
compensated for by better comfort of district heating. The social status of the DH consumers
is rather weak with poor solvency, compared with other groups of the population. The energy
expenses of the household amount up to 10-20% of family income, and to 50% or more for
retired people who live alone.
4.6 Latvia
Latvia has different patterns of energy pricing. In general, the Energy Regulation Board
regulates energy prices, but owing to a special authorization, regulation of heat prices is the
responsibility of municipalities. The existing law states that energy prices (including heat)
should reflect actual costs of energy supply and that neither subsidies nor a completely free
market would ensure efficient operation of DH systems. The law states that transparency of
the tariff is crucial for ensuring public acceptance of DH. The Government will not support
subsidies to energy producers or consumers, but aims at a pricing policy that ensures
sustainable energy development; social problems must be solved via social programs, not
energy subsidies. The law stipulates that excess electricity from CHP plants should be
purchased at higher rates. Although a transparent system for pricing of CHP electricity does
not yet exist, in principle it is based on the price of imported electricity plus a premium
covering the transmission losses from the border. In general, there are no subsidies for district
heating companies, which are operated and regulated at the municipal level. As municipal
budgets are constrained, financial assistance to the DH companies is rare. At present, energy
prices in most cases correspond to the actual costs of energy. Consumer groups - industry and
households - have already demonstrated their motivation to improve energy efficiency. In
areas with natural gas infrastructure, district heating is facing extreme pressure from the
public as more and more consumers switch to local gas fired heating. This way, individual
consumers avoid paying for the inefficiencies of the district heating systems. The inefficiency
of networks leads to environmental problems and strengthens the monopoly position of gas
companies. This trend is discussed publicly and it is likely that more and more municipalities
within their localities will separate natural gas and district heating zones.
4.7 Lithuania
Lithuania has established a State Control Commission, which regulates tariffs in the energy
sector. Until the end of 1996, all rulings on tariff policy were subject to direct approval by
central government, but since 1997, the Commission has been given (at least theoretically) a
higher degree of autonomy. Tariffs are revised twice a year, following a costs plus formula.
The development of the tariff policy has been generally successful, with the government
respecting its commitment to ensure that tariffs cover costs, in line with conditions attached to
World Bank funding. There is a mechanism securing subsidies for the lowest income renters.
The energy prices include 18% VAT for businesses and 9% for households.
4.8 Russia
Russia has a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Regional Energy
Regulatory Commissions (RERCs), but prices are not based on a market mechanism. Despite
the presence of the Federal Electricity Wholesale Market, consumers are captive and
producers do not compete. Industrial customers, the army and other federal institutions do not
pay for consumed electricity; the latter do not pay for fuels and so on. Wholesale tariffs for
electricity are established by FERC, and wholesale prices for gas by RERCs. Tariffs for
electricity produced in units using renewable energy resources are established at a level giving
an opportunity to recover capital investments according to terms to be discussed with the
RERC.
FERC and RERCs establish tariffs for heat and power in their regions for the wholesale and
retail markets. The Energy Strategy  2020 establishes a set of measures in the field of price
policy. It provides for the elimination of in kind payments for fuel and energy and seeks to
limit state funding of the various links in the energy chain. It is supposed to keep the State
regulation of tariffs, and aims at increasing the level of prices to cover all operational
expenses of supply companies and, in the nearest future, also an increasing share of
investment costs. Finally cross-subsiding should be withdrawn after the planned housing
sector reform in 2003. The role of district heating in expanding CHP production is not
recognized in legislation, regulations or other documents. Nor are there any programs in place
to support the development of CHP.
The main issue of price policy in the energy field is to contain the increase of domestic prices
for fuel and energy while rendering national manufacturers competitive under financially
stable conditions and attracting investment for the Russian fuel and energy companies. The
next step will be to eliminate disproportionate differences between prices of different fuels.
Established in 1999, relations between the coal, natural gas and oil prices have favoured
natural gas as the cheapest and best fuel, coal was number two and oil was the most
expensive. It is planned to use a part of the profits of gas companies to support some
categories of customers and for FERC infrastructure development. There will be different
prices in different regions due to transportation costs. For 2015  2020, it is envisaged that
domestic prices will reach international level except for transportation costs. The new price
policy has to be accompanied by direct subsidies to the poorest groups of people.
Taxation in the DH sector does not differ from taxation of other types of activities. No
incentives are provided for DH/CHP sector development. All types of fuel, heat and power are
subject to a 20% value added tax (VAT). The VAT is however reimbursed to the energy
industry. Electricity prices and the heat costs of DH companies include payments for the
impact of energy production on water and atmosphere. The amount depends upon the adverse
ecological impact, as well as on energy source location. There are no special benefits to
efficient production, such as DH/CHP, in terms of reduction of energy taxes.
4.9 Slovakia
Slovakia has currently two types of the prices. On the one hand, there are maximum prices,
which are officially set as a price limit for all types of fuel and energy used in households. On
the other, there are cost-reflective regulated prices, which include in the price economically
justified cost items (e.g. purchase of fuel, salaries, system maintenance and a reasonable
profit). The Ministry of Finance sets the maximum heat price for final consumers. In future,
the heat price development should solve the unsustainable situation of state subsidies and
distorted heat prices. The trend is to increasing the maximum heat price and decreasing
subsidies paid to the final consumers. Besides the maximum price, the real price will remain
cost-limited.
There is not any additional consumer energy tax. A 10% VAT concerns the sale of all goods
including primary fuels and energy services such as steam and hot water production,
transmission and distribution of electricity, gaseous fuels etc.
5. LIBERALIZATION OF THE HEAT MARKET
The first step towards liberalization of the heat market is the transition of ownership. The
progress in this process differs from one CEE country to another. Competition between
different heat supply systems (like DH, gas or electric heating etc.) is a crucial precondition
for heat market liberalization. Cross-subsidization within particular energy systems (small and
big consumers) still exists in the majority of CEE countries. A regulated energy pricing
system makes DH systems less competitive especially in comparison with gas prices. In some
countries Local Energy Planning is considered to be the best basis for choosing an optimal
heat supply system and avoiding the high costs of competing DH and gas infrastructure. As in
these countries municipalities are responsible for heat supply, the division of the city area
between natural gas and DH zones is left to their discretion. In some countries there is a
conviction that the heat market is competitive, but not liberalized. Under the transition to a
market economy, the heat supply is influenced by a gradual liberalization of both energy and
fuel prices as well as by the privatization of heat sources and DH networks. The problem of
third party access (TPA) in DH systems is a matter of tough discussion in Poland, but
enthusiasts of this solution do not take into account that TPA has not been implemented
anywhere else,. A much better solution would be an automatic control of heat supply network
(variable flow) and division of load between heat sources connected to the network according
to the offered heat prices (so called Economic Load Division).
6. TRENDS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND PROFITABILITY OF THE DH
SECTOR
Despite the different economic and organizational status of the DH sector in the various CEE
countries, there are similar trends in restructuring this sector. The main objectives are to
improve the efficiency and profitability of DH schemes, to change the structure of fuels used
in DH/CHP plants (increased share of gas, local renewables and refuse etc.) and to develop
CHP generation (especially small plants) etc. One important issue is the optimization of
energy supply both on a national and local scale. In many CEE countries, local authorities
own DH systems and are responsible for heat supply, but lack experience in local energy
strategy and planning. An extension of services to support municipalities in the development
of local energy markets and selection of reasonable solutions is therefore necessary (financial
and consulting institutions).
All CEE countries seek to modernize existing DH systems through the thermomodernization of buildings. This will result in reduction of heat losses and a better quality of
services as well as a decrease in average heat demand in buildings. Depending on the country,
either a moderate decrease of heat demand (e.g. Poland), or a stable share of the DH market
(e.g. Estonia) or the growth of heat consumption (e.g. Bulgaria) can be foreseen.
In order to improve the profitability of DH companies, apart from reduction of running costs
(owing to technical modernization), organizational changes are introduced in some countries,
like the creation of multi-utility energy companies (e.g. Poland) or companies providing
energy services (e.g. Lithuania). It is expected that a larger scope of activity will generate an
increase of income and improve the companys profitability and quality of services. The most
important problem connected with the profitability of DH companies is the existing pricing
system. There are still cross-subsidies and heat prices are not reflecting the costs.
Simultaneously, revenues of the population are low and the share of energy costs in household
budgets is very high. In several countries it is planned that heat prices will be gradually raised
and adjusted to actual production, transmission and distribution costs, together with the
elimination of cross-subsidies (especially direct state subsidies). In some countries (e.g. Czech
Republic) it is suggested to include in future environmental costs into the heat prices
(introduction of environmental taxes), in others it is planned that rise in heat prices will be
based on the estimated increase in fuel prices (e.g. Estonia).
Another problem affecting the profitability and competitiveness of DH companies is the
quality of heat supply control and consumers ability to regulate their heat consumption. This
problem is connected with the measurement of heat supply/consumption as well as with tariffs
and billing systems. In several countries, implementation of automatic control of heat supply
is planned, accompanied by metering and new tariffs and billing systems. These measures are
expected to stimulate the modernization process both on the supply and demand sides of the
DH systems.
A specific problem, which, in the authors view, is common both for CEE and EU countries,
is the setting of clear pricing principles for CHP (heat and electricity prices) and of
establishing rational electricity purchase procedures for these plants. This has a crucial
importance for the profitability of heat production in CHP plants and will influence the
development of DH systems (heat transmission/distribution).
7. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Bearing in mind that the reform of the DH systems in CEE towards more market is a
process, the following suggestions are made
7.1 to governments:
= to accord high priority to DH and CHP systems as important components of the
national economy; while DH and CHP are local supply sources, their modernization,
extension and role are issues of national importance
= to secure fair inter-fuel competition by eliminating preferential pricing and tarification
for competing fuels
= to encourage the process of restructuring, price liberalization, privatization and
decentralization of DH and CHP companies, bearing in mind that several ownership
models apply
= to avoid approaches which discriminate against the DH/CHP sector in comparison
with other energy industries (in taxation, regulatory regimes, emissions etc.)
= to eliminate financial charges and restrictions that had their origin in central planning,
thus enabling a fresh start of the DH/CHP industries
= to have the State budget compensate for foregone revenues of DH/CHP companies as
a result of applying social heat tariffs
= to establish an independent regulatory body for determining heat supply tariffs, third
party access (TPA) to gas and power grids, metering and billing procedures, unless
this function is divested to municipalities; to secure fair competition, this regulatory
body should cover all grid-based energies to clearly state, that TPA concerns only gas
networks and power grids (according to the EU directives) and is not possible in DH
(local) systems (networks) 1
= to enunciate guidelines with a view to:
= eliminating cross-subsidies between households and industrial consumers
establishing fair rules for the allocation of the benefits from co-generation to
electricity and heat prices respectively
= enhancing the transparency of tariffs
= improving services to customers (efficiency of heat use, fair billing methods)
= establishing energy auditing
to favor an increased role of local authorities and to assist them in the development of local
energy systems
for the time being, to avoid charging the DH/CHP (and other energy) industries with
additional externalities (environmental cost), given the unfavorable social and other
implications of such an increase, and the uncertainties surrounding the concept of
internalization of external costs and benefits
to implement a methodology  compatible with EU standards  for tariff setting and statistics
purposes in CHP production
7.2 to municipalities
= to increasingly view and determine the development of DH/CHP as part of local energy
systems using gas, coal, refuse or renewables and promoting insulation, rational use of
energy, and small, decentralized plants
= to arbitrate competition between grid-based energies (heat, gas, electricity) on the basis of
life cycle cost
= to abstain from operational activities, but entrust the management of DH/CHP companies
to the private sector, in particular energy service or multi-fuel companies
= to encourage effective multi-fuel competition on the local energy market and the
liberalization of energy prices generally.
Comments:
In DH systems for economic reasons (high investment costs and long pay-back period) almost every unit of
heat source and component of network is designed for identified consumers (single - like hospital, industry
etc., or groups - like housing estates etc.).
The operator of the DH networks is dispatching a heat source load according to the atmospheric conditions
(outside temperature) as well as well to defined parameters and flow of heat carrier in the networks. The main
principle of load dispatching is to utilize the cheapest heat source as a 'basic source' and step by step order
heat delivery from more expensive "peak sources" according to the increase of heat demands/load (so-called
"economic division of heat sources load").
If any part of the cheapest "basic" heat source capacity will be ordered by one consumer (and heat
transmitted on the basis of the TPA principle), this capacity will be used during a shorter time in comparison
with the utilization of that capacity for needs of all consumers connected to the network.
Thus, a reduced capacity and heat production has to be supplied for the other consumers from another heat
source with higher heat price. It causes cross-subsidizing that one consumer, buying the cheapest heat directly
in cheapest heat source, to the detriment of another consumer connected to the network; this violates one of
the most important laws about equal treatment of all similar consumers connected to the network
(antimonopoly law).
This is also the opinion of colleagues of the author from Denmark and Finland, who are well known experts
in DH not only in their countries but also in the world beyond.

PROCESS AND EXPERIENCE
by Dimitar Hadi-Miev , PhD ME 4
1. COMPANY PROFILE
Toplifikacija AD is the largest heat producer in the country, and at the same time, constitutes
an important segment of the energy system of the Republic of Macedonia.
The primary activity of Toplifikacija AD Skopje is the production and distribution of heat. In
the near future, Toplifikacija AD will expand its activity into the production of electricity and
distribution of gas.
The operation of the company started in 1965. Since its establishment and until 1999, the
company went through several organizational forms, conforming to the laws that were in
force in various periods. In 1999, to conform with the Law on Transformation of Enterprises
with Social Capital, a transformation of the company took place to comply with the Law on
Trade Companies.
Today, Toplifikacija AD is a modern, professionally organized company, characterized by a
high level of automation of the production process, the metering of heat consumed, and a
development strategy both with regard to future organization and technological development
in operations.
The company has already prepared an investment program for expanding its business into
other branches of the energy system, such as the production of electricity and distribution of
gas, in order to achieve higher profits from operations.
Toplifikacija AD provides heat for houses and business premises per user category, as
follows:
Housing premises

Toplifikacija AD provides heat to 30% of the city of Skopje, or to 10% of the Republic of
Macedonia, and thus constitutes a significant segment of the energy system in the Republic of
Macedonia.
2. PRIVATIZATION
To conform with the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital, Toplifikacija
AD Skopje was transformed into a mixed ownership company, with a basic stock of 450,000
shares with a nominal value per share of DM 100, i.e. DM 45,000,000.
Toplificacija AD, Skopje, email h.misev@toplif.com.mk
In line with the Act of Privatization and the Model of Workers Buy-Out, Toplifikacija AD
Skopje has been privatized to the extent of 68.35%. In accordance with an Agreement with
the Privatization Agency of the Republic of Macedonia, the company has taken on the
obligation to purchase within 2000-2004 a further 10% of the basic stock, i.e. 45,000 shares.
With the payment of the first installment in 2000, the company was privatized to the extent of
70.39%, i.e. 316,765 ordinary shares are in private ownership.
The remaining 35,949 shares are owned by the Privatization Agency of the Republic of
Macedonia for the next four years. As prescribed by the Law and the Agreement; they are
treated as priority shares, but without voting privilege. Once purchased, these shares are
transformed into ordinary shares, with voting privilege. In addition, the Privatization Agency
owns 75,943 ordinary shares, or 16.88% of the basic stock, as residual.
In accordance with the Law, the enterprises that are transformed into private ownership
transfer to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, free of charge, an amount of 15% of the
remaining social capital, which in the case of Toplifikacija AD Skopje amounts to 21,343
shares, or 4.74% of the basic stock. These are priority shares, which once purchased become
ordinary shares, with the same privileges as the other ordinary shares.
Toplifikacija AD was founded in 1965 as the Board for Central Heating for the City with the
status of a legal entity, based on a Decision taken by the Assembly of the City of Skopje. In
1973, and based on a Decision by the Assembly of Workers, the Board for Central Heating
for the City of Skopje established itself as an Organization of Associated Labor (OAL), with
special social interest, under the name "Central Heating of the City of Skopje", in short
"Toplifikacija". OAL was to execute the program and projects for central heating for the city
of Skopje as an investor, as well as to undertake studies, research and projects, exploit the
heating transmission system in the City, manage several existing facilities for central heating,
and terminate the construction of already started facilities.
Following the changes in ownership imposed by the implementation of the Law on Social
Capital, the company passed a Decision in 1991 to transform itself into a shareholding
company, whereby it changed from an enterprise with social ownership into an enterprise
with mixed ownership, under the name Toplifikacija AD - Skopje c.o. Privatization began in
1991. However, the Law on Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital (1993),
excluded Toplifikacija from the process of completing the privatization. The procedure
resumed in 1999. After a public announcement, an Agreement was concluded with the
Privatization Agency for the sale of the social capital of Toplifikacija AD. When this
procedure was concluded, Toplifikacija AD became a shareholding company with mixed
ownership.
The subject of privatization was the heat sources (heat plants). The distribution network
remained state-owned. Toplifikacija AD leases the distribution network according to an
agreement. According to this agreement, Toplifikacija AD is to secure the maintenance of the
distribution network and to expand it each year at an expense equal to the yearly depreciation
of the distribution network. In addition, Toplifikacija AD pays to the State a certain rent per
year.
Toplifikacija AD is obliged to buy thermal energy from any supplier if this thermal energy is
available at an appropriate point of the distribution network and if the price is equal or less
than production price of Toplifikacija AD.
3. FINANCE FOR DISTRICT HEATING SYSTEM
During the process of ownership transformation of AD Toplifikacija, the official financial
organs have kept under review the structure of the existing capital of the company from its
foundation until today. The basic conclusion of that analysis was that there is no state-owned
capital in this company. There is social capital (capital which is the result of the functioning
of the company until today) and private capital, which was created through the transformation
(purchase) of part of the social capital of the company by the employees in the company in
accordance with the laws valid in Macedonia.
The conclusion that there is no state-owned capital in the company is a consequence of the
fact that the district heating system can be enjoyed only by a limited number of citizens in the
city and country. In the case of Skopje and Macedonia, at present this amounts to
approximately 30% of the citizens of Skopje or 10% of the citizens of Macedonia. The
consumers of heat from the district heating system pay up to two times less for their heating
than the consumers with any other heating systems. It is also a fact that when they are heated
by district heating the consumers have an exceptionally high comfort level and almost no
obligations in connection with the heating.
Having in mind these benefits of district heating, as well as the fact that it is available only for
a limited number of users, it is obvious that it is absolutely unacceptable for the State to invest
its own funds in this business. This would mean that exceptionally favorable conditions would
be created with State capital for only a limited number of persons, and the rest would never be
able to achieve such comfort, as district heating systems are economically viable only if
constructed for parts of the city with a certain density of heat consumption. Having in mind
these facts, it is clear that the production and distribution of heat is intended for customers
who have the possibility and wish to use the services of the district heating system.
It is the States obligation to regulate the relations between the customers and the suppliers in
this field, and to care for the correct implementation of the contracted obligations between
them. These are the premises upon which the district heating system of Skopje, operated by
AD Toplifikacija, has been constructed and developed. The State has never invested its
resources in this system.
Toplifikacija has operated and functioned in the past with commercial credits from
commercial banks, from connecting taxes billed to future consumers and from the
results of its work. This is why Macedonia decided to include the district heating system
of AD Toplifikacija in the first phase of privatization, registering Toplifikacija as a
share-holding company and not as a public company/utility.
The first sources of funds for the construction of the district heating system were commercial
credits from commercial banks as well as funds for the development of the economy. These
sources were the only ones in the first 8 to 10 years of development of the system. When the
credits became expensive, a connection charge was introduced, and its proceeds were used for
its development. This charge was only paid by those that wished to be connected to the
system and to become consumers of its heat. The proceeds were supposed to cover the costs
of construction of the secondary hot-water pipelines of the system.
At that moment, the development of the heating plants and the main pipelines was financed
from the current revenues of the system, with the possible use of commercial credits. After a
period of 8 to 9 years, this manner of financing became insufficient. A second charge for
connecting to district heating was then introduced. This manner of financing of the
development continued until the end of 1998. In the beginning of 1999, a new Methodology
of Forming of Prices of all Types of Energy came into force, for the first time, applied to the
entire energy sector and the district heating systems. Now, the price takes into account a
planned profit of up to 8% of the value of the fixed assets and the working capital invested in
the energy enterprise. With pricing of heat in accordance with the Methodology of Prices,
there is no more a necessity for a connection charge. The share-holding company will now
be able to carry out the development and expansion of its system with a part of the
realized profit.
Certain conditions must be met in order to attract investment capital in the form of shares in
the energy sector as a whole, and thus also in the district heating sector. The first and most
important condition is for the State to strictly define the operating conditions, by law. All
energy systems, and the DH systems specifically, have certain monopolistic characteristics
and not all general market rules will apply completely. These companies may also not be put
under total State control, because the only source of financing in that case would be the State
itself and its budget sources, which already have a problem in meeting all basic State
expenditures. It is also impossible for others to invest capital in these companies, while the
State still takes the main decisions. Because of the characteristics of the type of business, it is
most favorable if the State precisely defines the operating rules beforehand. The future users
of the systems as well as the potential investors would, in this manner, know exactly what
awaits them. In such conditions, the expected profits made possible by these rules are
somewhat smaller, yet this is a long-term business with a secure market and low risk of not
being able to realize the expected profits.
4. LEGISLATION
In Macedonia, the main legislative acts for district heating are:
= Energy Law, adopted by Parliament
= The General Conditions of Delivery of Heat, adopted by the Municipality
= The Methodology for the Forming of Prices of all Types of Energy, adopted by
Government
= The Special Conditions for Delivery of Heat, adopted by the Municipality
= The Tariff System for the Delivery of Heat, adopted by Government
= License and License agreement signed between the Municipality and Toplifikacija AD
These documents set the legal framework for the production and distribution of heat.
Of essential importance for attracting capital to this segment of the energy sector is the
Methodology of Prices. This Act guarantees that the State cannot pass political decisions in
the field of energy prices. According to this Act, the price is based on normalized costs, which
have been accepted during the functioning of the system in the past, and contains a certain
recognized profit. This means that if the system is more efficient than the previous one, profits
will increase, and vice-versa, if the system is operated inefficiently, it will create losses.
5. ELIMINATION OF MONOPOLY
The main condition for privatization in the infrastructure business is the elimination of any
monopoly. In our case, this elimination is realized through:
a) Obligatory tender process for each new district heating system
b) Obligatory methodology of pricing
c) Obligation to buy thermal energy, if available at an appropriate point of the
distribution network and if offered at a price equal or less than the production price
of Toplifikacija AD.
6. CONSUMER PROTECTION
The first condition for consumer protection is the elimination of the monopoly; the second is a
licence. According to this licence, Toplifikacija AD is obliged to secure normal supply with
thermal energy throughout the heating season. The third condition is a contract with
customers for heat delivery.
7. LICENSE
According to the Energy Law, business in the energy sector is possible if the company is a
public enterprise or if it has a licence from the authority responsible for certain energy
activities.
For district heating, the responsible authority is the municipality. The licence is valid for one
or several city areas. For each licence, the municipality announces a tender. The winner of the
tender process signs the licence agreement with the municipality. If the licence holder does
not fulfill the agreement, the municipality has the right to cancel it.
8. EXPERIENCE
Toplifikacija AD has operated as a private company for almost three years. During this
period, its shares were traded on the stock market. Since 1999, the price of shares increased
slowly from 15 DEM to 50 DEM per one share. Share prices peaked at two occasions: when
Toplifikacija AD started with its official quotation on the stock market, and when
shareholders received an offer from a strategic investor for buying the majority. Shares
peaked at around 65 DEM. New shareholders currently hold more than 10% of the shares.
During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the dividend stood at 5.5% of the nominal value of the share.
The dividend for 1999 and 2000 has already been paid to shareholders. The dividend for 2001
is being paid between June and December 2002.
The level of dividend at 5.5% of the nominal value of the share explains why the price of
shares is about 50% of the nominal value. The expected level of dividend for invested money
in Macedonia is between 10 and 12% for this type of business.
In this period, Toplifikacija AD implemented several new investments. First was the new
district heating system called Skopje North in a separate part of Skopje. Capacity of this
system is 50 MW. At present, 25 MW of demand is connected. Investments amounted to 7
million DEM. The sole investor was Toplifikacija AD.
Secondly, in the city of Bitola, Toplifikacija AD began activities in 2000 with several small
district heating systems which, however, are not presently operating. In this moment, 15 MW
are connected. For this business, Toplifikacija AD established a new company called
Toplifikacija Bitola.
Third, the shareholders of Toplifikacija AD created a new company called Toplifikacija
Maintenance AD that is a service company to Toplifikacija AD. The main activities of this
company are civil works and transportation of fuel oil.
9. NEW PLANS
Building new district heating systems in several cities in Macedonia is the first priority.
Toplifikacija AD worked for several years work on building a CHP plant in Skopje. The
electric capacity will be around 200 MW, and heat capacity 150 MW. In the past, we had
several potential partners for this project. Now, we are working with the Public Power
Corporation of Macedonia (ESM).
Toplifikacija AD is ready to invest in distribution of natural gas to householders. Since 1997,
Toplifikacija AD has used natural gas as an alternative fuel, but distribution of natural gas to
householders has not yet started. We expect that the distribution of natural gas to households
will start in a very near future, and we are ready to invest in this business.

HEAT SUPPLY SYSTEMS IN LATVIA

1. INTRODUCTION
District heating in Latvia forms the backbone of the heat market. Approximately 70% of
households are connected to a district-heating grid, and district heating accounts for 39% of
primary energy consumption.
A decisive factor in Latvian energy policy is dependence on imports of energy. Roughly 80%
of primary energy sources are being imported, mainly from Russia. Between 40-50% of
electricity consumption is being imported. This dependence creates strong political support
for energy saving techniques such as district heating and cogeneration, though realisation of
these goals is hampered by shortage of funds for investment in the energy sector.
Latvia has good potential for CHP, since it needs to import most of its electricity and the
country lacks indigenous resources. Against this background, it is not surprising that there is a
framework supporting co-generation and renewables. In practice the Governments attitude
towards co-generation is somewhat ambiguous, however, as the conditions for CHP producers
worsened in the last years.
The way ahead entails deregulation and competition, but many challenges must be confronted
in this context. In general, there are no subsidies for district heating companies. Being
operated and regulated at the municipal level, district-heating companies may, in principle,
receive financial assistance from the respective municipalities. As municipal budgets are very
constrained, however, this happens very rarely.
District heating tariffs vary widely  from 18 ECU/MWh at the low end to 47 ECU/MWh at
the high end. At present, energy prices in most cases correspond to the actual costs of energy.
Consumer groups  industry and households - have already demonstrated their motivation to
improve energy efficiency.
In areas with a natural gas infrastructure, district heating is facing extreme pressure from the
public as more and more consumers switch to local gas fired heating. In this way, consumers
avoid paying for the inefficiencies of the district heating systems. The inefficiency of district
heating networks tends to cause environmental problems and strengthens the gas companys
monopoly. This trend is being publicly discussed and it is likely that more and more
municipalities within their localities will separate natural gas and district heating zones.
2. STRATEGIES AND FRAMEWORK FOR THE ENERGY SECTOR
Responsibility for economic activities in the energy field is divided among several structures.
The Ministry of Transport is in charge of transport and production of oil. The Ministry of
Finance is responsible for trade of oil products and the Ministry of Economics for all other
for contact: zeltinsh@edi.lv
economic activities in the field of energy. Operating under the legislative authority of the
Saeima (parliament) and the executive authority of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of
Economy is the central government energy office. It develops and implements the national
economic policy. The Energy Department of the Ministry of Economy works out the energy
sector development concepts, manages and analyses the energy resource balance
development, prepares draft internal agreements in energy, co-ordinates efficient use of
energy resources, analyses investment projects in energy and participates in the regulatory
activities of energy utilities.
The Energy Supply Regulation Board is the government administrative body operating under
the supervision of the Ministry of Economy. Its main tasks are:
= To issue licences to energy utilities engaged in entrepreneurial activities.
= To review and approve of tariffs calculated by energy utilities.
= To issue licences (the Licensing Office is its executive institution).
The Energy Department of the Latvian Development Agency works out draft concepts for
energy development, analyses development in the energy sector, and engages in activities for
increasing energy efficiency and other activities in the field of energy.
After the abolition of the planned economy and with a view to representing their interests and
unifying their activities, energy utilities, companies etc. have established:
= The Association for District Heating, whose members produce 80% of district heat in
Latvia, as well as selling and installing heating equipment.
= The Association of Energy Resources Suppliers, whose members sell fuel (mainly
liquid).
= The Energy Development Centre, dealing with the implementation of cogeneration,
wind energy etc.
= The Association Bio-energy, developing bio fuels.
Presently the main law in the energy sector that also deals with district heating is the "Law on
Regulation of Business Activities in Energy Industries" passed by Parliament on 6 September
1995. This law sets certain powers and duties of entrepreneurs in the energy supply sector in
order to ensure continuous and undisturbed energy supply to consumers, to protect the
interests of energy consumers, to encourage business in this field and ensure that energy
supply complies with the national energy policy. Basically, it sets the procedures for energy
sector regulation and licensing of energy supply companies.
According to the law, a licence is required if:
= Heat is produced in equipment with a total installed capacity exceeding 1 MW;
= Heat is transported or distributed via pipelines with diameters exceeding 200 mm;
= Sales of heat to any consumers exceed 20 000 MWh per year.
According to the law, an Energy Regulation Board  a multifunctional Public Services
Regulation Board - was set up performing among others the following main functions:
= Regulating: energy; telecommunications, post; railway tariffs:
= Licensing of energy supply enterprises;
= Approving tariffs calculated by energy supply enterprises;
= Developing a methodology for calculation of tariffs;
= Defining the procedure for approval of tariffs;
= Protecting energy consumers,
= Reviewing disputes between energy consumers and suppliers and taking decisions that
are binding for both parties and that can be appealed against before the Court,
following a procedure set by the Law;
= Developing regulations on energy production and supply;
= Promoting competition in energy supply.
The Energy Regulatory Board:
= Requests any information from energy supply enterprises necessary for carrying out
its duties;
= Sets norms regulating energy supply within the limits of its competence;
= Develops explanations of the norms regulating energy supply.
The Board decisions are binding for all energy supply enterprises. According to the law, the
Board may, by a special authorisation, delegate some of its functions to municipalities.
Regulation of heat supply has actually been transferred to the municipalities, whereas the
Board still retains its powers to licence district-heating companies and settle any disputes
emerging with regard to district heating.
To reinforce the development of efficient cogeneration systems, Article 27.9 of the law
stipulates that the excess electricity from cogeneration plants with installed capacity should be
purchased at higher rates. There have been long disputes concerning the application of this
article, though at present each such case is treated separately and the prices are set by a
Cabinet of Minister's decision. In 1998, the prices have been in the range of 0,023 - 0,027
Ls./kWh, which is well below the formerly applicable double average sales price.
Although a transparent system for pricing of CHP-generated electricity does not yet exist, the
basic principle is based on the price of imported electricity plus a premium covering the
transmission losses from the border.
The next relevant policy document is "the Government Policy in the Energy Sector" accepted
by the Cabinet of Ministers on May 7, 1996 which sets the basic principles for the regulation
in the energy sector. It states that the Government will not support subsidies to energy
producers or consumers, but will aim at a pricing policy that ensures sustainable energy
development. The prices (including district heating) should reflect actual costs of energy
supply. Regarding social issues, the document states that social problems should be dealt with
through social programs not energy subsidies.
The energy policy supports privatisation as a tool to improve efficiency and competitiveness
while Government interference should be reduced. Cogeneration is given a high priority.
Restructuring of district heating companies into joint stock firms with private participation is
considered an important measure to improve administration and quality of services. The
document stresses the importance of environmental issues, which in reality would bring
substitution of HFO by natural gas, wider utilisation of cogeneration and renewable energy
(biomass). Energy efficiency issues are addressed separately with a promise to support the
improvements by any available means.
General policy in the district heating sector is set by a document called "State and Municipal
Heating Policy" accepted in principle by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 2, 1997. The
document states that efficient district heating systems are considered the most
environmentally friendly and convenient solution for the community comparing with other
options. Therefore, district heating is strongly supported from the official side. Transparency
of tariff systems is considered crucial for ensuring that the public accepts district heating. It is
also stated that neither subsidised nor a completely free market would ensure efficient
operation of DH systems.
The main tasks in the long term are:
= Local governments shall select a reasonable general heating strategy in compliance
with the National Energy Program;
= Existing heat suppliers shall improve technical conditions and efficiency of presently
operational heating networks and shall introduce energy saving technologies;
= Heat consumers shall select technically and economically reasonable and
environmentally friendly types of heating and reduce heat losses.
The document particularly stresses the importance of commercialising the district heating
systems  i. e. of the introduction of market principles with certain restrictions when public
interests are affected. Promotion of this objective entails ensuring that:
= A favourable environment for commercialisation of central heating through promotion
of competition, support to consumers right to chose, etc.,
= Stability of the legislative framework, stable tariffs, improved payments discipline,
licensing, a friendly climate for attraction of capital;
= Motivation of both the producers and the consumers to carry out technical
reconstruction;
= Incentives for local governments urging them to give up direct entrepreneurial
activities related to heat generation and restricting them to control and management, as
well as long term planning functions in the sector.
Summarising the policy as set by the above documents, the following important points should
be stressed:
= District heating is a responsibility of the local government in each locality;
= Any disputes arising in connection with district heating prices etc. between the
municipality, consumers and the DHC are settled by the Energy Regulation Board as a
first instance;
= Although a transparent system for pricing CHP-generated electricity has not yet been
introduced, this is not an obstacle to the development of independent power projects;
certain informal rules are applied;
= Energy efficiency investments are strongly supported. In this regard, there are no
obstacles to development of direct lending schemes or to application of ESCO
concepts.
3. MARKET ORGANISATION
In Latvia, most of the district heating systems are municipally owned with a very few
exceptions. Rigas Siltums is a joint stock company with some minor private participation as
well as the presently insolvent district heating companies in Liepaja, Jelgava and Talsi. There
are no legal obstacles in further restructuring the district-heating sector where the companies
are municipally owned. In many cases, the municipalities would be willing to discuss the
privatisation with a serious investor. The major problem, however, is connected with the
financial attractiveness of the companies (accounts receivables, old debts, etc.).
The municipalities are strictly regulated with regard to the loans and guarantees they may
issue. The Cabinet Ministers Regulations on Municipal Loans and Guarantees not only limit
the total amount of loans for all Latvian municipalities but also relate the loans taken by
individual municipalities to their annual budgets6. In addition, a special Commission on
Supervision and Control of Municipal Loans and Guarantees is set up that approves all and
any loans drawn or and guarantees issued by a municipality. It is, thereby, illegal for the
municipality to take any loans or issue guarantees without having the approval of this
Commission. Recently the system for municipal lending has been supplemented by an option
to take loans from the State Treasury after having obtained the permission of the Commission
on Supervision and Control of Municipal Loans and Guarantees. In early 2000, the rate was at
11-13%.
In this respect, a municipally owned DH company is treated as the municipality itself 
without a guarantee from the local government it cannot receive any loans. Thus, even if the
DHS is performing well, its ability to attract financing may be limited by other municipal
investment projects (e.g. water and sewage, municipal waste). In fact, presently, these
regulations are limiting co-generation projects that require very substantial investments. If
such rules will continue to exist, the Clearinghouse may have to exploit advanced financing
schemes (e.g. ESCO type).
Commercial banks are very active within the energy sector. Apart from providing short term
financing for fuel purchases they are increasingly being involved in financing medium term
projects (up to 5 years). On some occasions commercial banks have offered better terms than
e.g. EEF. Any municipality or DH company maintains very good relations with at least one
bank. This enables the client to sign a loan contract with that bank within less than 2 weeks
(provided it has approval from the Municipal Credit Commission). Effective interest rates
very from 9% to 13% per year.
Finally, leasing companies are becoming increasingly involved in financing e.g. installation of
substations and boilers. In many cases due to accounting regulations, leasing provides a very
attractive option at rates in the range of 11-14% per year.
4. ENERGY CAPACITY AND DISTRICT HEATING/CHP
Latvias main indigenous energy resources are limited to hydro, biomass (wood, etc.) and
peat. The hydro potential is already well utilised with the main reserves in small hydro
installations. Effective regulations entitle the small hydro owners to sell their power at double
the average electricity sales price (at 0,06 EUR/kWh). This has largely expedited construction
of small hydro power plants (SHPP) and subsequently around 30 SHPPs are added each year.
It is unlikely that access to more attractive financing schemes could greatly facilitate the
process since even at present such projects demonstrate excellent returns.
Forests that provide a valuable resource for Latvias main export industry cover around 42%
of the countrys area. With the exception of a few localities woodworking industry is
omnipresent and generates considerable volumes of wood residues that are increasingly
- principal and loan payments in 1999 could not exceed 30% of their annual budget
utilised in local district heating systems (DHS). Consequently, by 1998 wood fuel
consumption had doubled compared to 1996 and covered 26% of the primary energy
consumption. A major part of it, however, relates to consumption of wood logs used in very
small DHS (>3 MW) and local boiler plants. Most of the recent rehabilitation projects
anticipate conversion of log boiler plants to combine wood chip/sawdust installations. These
projects will however not yield substantial savings in greenhouse gas emissions. The limiting
factor in deploying larger wood chip installations is the fuel supply infrastructure, that takes
time to develop, as well as resource limitations. The process however develops quite rapidly.
In 2000  2002 export volumes of wood chips, sawdust and firewood waste have risen
dramatically, and Latvia is anticipating a lack of wood fuel for DH boiler houses!
Over the recent years, peat consumption in Latvia has been negligible with the bulk relating to
the Riga CHP-1 and Struzani peat factorys CHP. Reportedly even this consumption serves
as a social support to an otherwise declining industry and is not at all cost-efficient. Provincial
towns in Latvia located close to production sites mostly have a maximum heat load of below
20 MW, which cannot justify application of modern peat combustion technologies (e.g.
fluidised bed), especially when wood resources are abundant.
Although in 1998 oil products covered 37% of the total primary energy consumption, the
energy sector accounted for less than half of that. Due to its high price, LFO applications are
negligible while high sulphur content HFO installations were widely used for medium to large
DHS. This sector, with a total annual energy consumption of around 500 000 toe, represents a
major area for reduction of greenhouse gases. Even though most of this consumption relates
to dual (gas/HFO) plants and is based on the competitive HFO price, there are a few systems
outside the gas supply area that could possibly be converted to biomass.
Natural gas plays an important role in Latvias energy sector and in early 2000 was the second
cheapest fuel option after wood. In 2001, the natural gas share in DH fuel resources had risen
to 56% due to high mazut prices! Most of the systems utilising gas indicate relatively good
efficiency and may not be considered as the main area for emission reduction. Especially due
to their inherent potential for conversion to combined heat and power, these systems deserve
special attention in the context of energy efficiency measures.
Consumption of coal in Latvia in 1998 decreased to some 40% of its 1996 level and amounted
to just some 81 000 toe. This trend is expected to continue as the old coal boilers reach the
end of their technical lifetime and are replaced by biomass or gas installations. Households
and a number of local boiler plants are the main consumers of coal.
Since the present power generation structure will have a detrimental effect on the baseline
emission level, it should be mentioned that domestic production presently only covers 50-75%
of consumption, while the remainder is being imported from neighbouring countries.
Generation facilities include large hydro scheme on Daugava and two natural gas based CHPs
in Riga supplemented by a number of independent CHPs and SHPPs.
5. LATVIA ON THE WAY TO EU  GOOD COGENERATION POTENTIAL AND
DH PROBLEMS
Out of Latvias total gross primary energy consumption of 159,145 TJ (2000), 111,908 TJ
were imported (70%), that means, Latvia is heavily depending on fossil fuel imports from
Russia. Furthermore, out of 127,518 TJ of final energy consumption (2000), more than 40,656
TJ were used for heating. Considering that Latvia has well developed district heating
networks (up to 60% of households are connected to district heating), there is a large potential
for energy efficiency  both in heat energy from cogeneration, and from energy savings at the
end-user side. Enhanced efficiency would reduce emissions, particularly GH gasses.
The share of cogeneration in the Latvian DH systems (DHS) amounts approximately to 33%
as regards the whole country, and to 66 % in the metropolitan area of Riga. That means, that
outside Riga the share of cogeneration is less than 5%.
Combined heat and power (CHP) is a key concept for saving both primary energy resources
and decreasing DH system emissions. The EU Commission shares this viewpoint: a
Cogeneration Directive is under discussion in the Commission.
Therefore, small and medium-sized cogeneration must be developed in Latvia for heat
production. This means that energy planning at the national and municipal level is urgently
needed to optimize energy utilization both for the benefit of the customers and for the
environment.
Another problem in the energy field in Latvia is regulation. Since 2001, according to Latvian
legislation (based on World Bank recommendations), a multi-branch Regulator is regulating
the electricity and natural gas sectors, while heat produced in cogeneration (8852 MWh) is
under State control. Considering that the regulation of the heat energy sector is arbitrarily
separated from the other energy sectors, the question arises: how to regulate the heat energy
sector, when heat supply in Latvia is decentralized and under municipal responsibility, and
only half of the DHS fuel share is regulated by the State Regulator? Wood covers 14-15% of
total DHS fuel use; the share of waste is nearly zero  in contrast to the White Paper on
Renewable Energy.
There are other non-solved issues:
there is no State Energy Policy;
there is no Energy Efficiency Strategy;
there is no support for cogeneration through State Energy Policy.
The basic problem in Latvia is lack of financial resources for investments in sustainable
primary energy
6. VARIOUS PROJECTS AND STUDIES
In principle, a few main project types can be distinguished:
DH generation  fuel conversion. As described above, Latvia is no longer a very lucrative
area in respect to HFO or coal to biomass conversion projects. However, for the time being
there still are a few sites that can host this kind of a project. So far in local circumstances,
these projects yield a payback time of 3-4 years with an estimated interest rate of around 8%
per year and can be relatively easily financed from presently accessible financial sources.
DH generation  co-generation. Even though this area for the time being is the largest area
for project implementation, it is not exactly clear whether and on which terms such projects
could be initiated under the greenhouse gas emission trading schemes. Regulations governing
installations of below 4 MWe are in place and should yield a payback time of 4-5 years with
an estimated interest rate of around 8% per year.
DH distribution  network rehabilitation. Such projects require major investments
characterised as a rule by returning marginal savings with payback times of over 10 years at
an estimated interest rate of below 8% per year. It should however be noted that the network
lifetime is very considerable and may extend to 40-50 years or more. However, this advantage
is unlikely to offset the modest savings of energy and subsequent emissions.
Industrial processes can include various types of projects, although:
= in Latvia there are very few energy intensive industries
= major businesses cannot qualify for even small energy projects (> 50.000 EUR)
= new technology dominates the key sectors
= in future, many expansion projects will be required to meet rising production volumes
= the sector is less than tolerant to institutional burdens (e.g. tendering, reporting, etc.)
and does not believe in outside assistance and
= the sector has established good relationships with partner banks which provide
immediate financing. It should however be possible for the Chains scheme to
penetrate this market if it manages not only to offer very competitive financing terms
but actively markets its services as well.
Housing energy efficiency improvements are rather investment-intensive and usually yield
payback times of over 15 years. The most energy efficient measures (e.g. installation of
substations, new boiler, insulation of windows or even attic) require negligible investment and
have very fast payback times of less than 2 years. Complex projects will be implemented as
life standards increase while emission reduction mechanisms could speed up the process. Can
be considered on standalone basis if the emission reduction gains (revenues) are very
substantial.
Electricity production from renewables (wind, hydro, etc.): projects in Latvia could be
treated similarly to co-generation projects.
Consequently, in Latvias circumstances it is suggested that initial analysis of the Chains
scheme focuses on fuel conversion and industrial projects. Co-generation should also be
considered as it has the largest project potential. In that case possible projects will either be
hosted by a municipal DH company or a business.
6. EXISTING INSTRUMENTS FOR FINANCING
The Public Investment Program (PIP), available to municipalities and operated by the State,
provides some funding for energy projects in the form of subsidies. The relevant ministries in
the government each deal with the PIP according to their competence. Thus, the Ministry of
Education deals with schools while the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development
deals with housing projects. The Energy Department of the Ministry of Economy deals with
energy production and transmission issues. Applications to PIP are sent in two stages. The
project lifecycle starts 2 years before the actual financing is made available. First, by
November the municipality submits a short concept description and, then if the Ministry
supports it, a detailed project description in February. If after the final analysis, the project is
accepted, it is included into the PIP for the next year. The structure of financing depends on
the total national budget and changes each year. PIP for the year 2000 would require 20%
financing from the municipality, a 35%-40% state subsidy and a 40% long term loan. In 2000,
the total value of projects to be financed within PIP is 30 million EUR with a state subsidy of
3 million EUR.
The Municipal Development Fund (MDF) under the Ministry of Economy has been
established to service the World Banks loan provided to the government and disbursed to
municipalities. Although presently it has exhausted its resources, MDF financed municipal
infrastructure projects at around 8.6% interest with loans extending to 10 years. Reportedly
the World Bank is considering opening a new tranche for such projects. MDF applies World
Banks procurement procedure.
The Environment Investment Fund (EIF) under the Ministry of Environment and Regional
Development has been established to service a mix of EU Phare and state budget funds to
finance environmentally friendly energy systems. The projects can be submitted by private as
well as municipal entities. Since the most important criterion for the Fund is environmental
impact, it mainly supports fuel conversion as well as renewable energy projects (SHPP, wind
power). EIF provides long-term (10 year) loans at 6-8% interest. EIF applies Phare
procurement regulations and has suffered from lengthy and complex procedures.
The Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF) under the Ministry of Economy has been established to
service a mix of EU Phare and local commercial funding to disburse lower-than-market
interest rate loans to energy efficiency projects. EEF system might be very relevant in
designing the Clearinghouse model since it employs local banks for securing the payback; it
undertakes as well a certain project validation procedures in respect to energy efficiency.
Presently EEF can provide loans at below 8% per year for up to 10 years. Recently the Funds
focus has shifted towards industrial projects. It should be noted that EEF initially was not as
smooth as it might appear and the experience gained is invaluable for designing any future
financing schemes. EEF applies Phare procurement procedures.
The overview of existing instruments for financing given above indicates that the constantly
developing financial market in Latvia has reached a stage where access to funds does not
actually limit project implementation. Experience indicates that on some occasions there has
been competition even between such semi-public institutions as MDF, EEF and EIF.
Competition between banks and/or leasing companies is very intense, though guarantees still
play the decisive role.
7. ENERGY PRICE REGULATION
The Energy Law respects the requirements of the European Union directives  90/377/EEC 
On the Community procedures for the improvement of transparency of electricity and gas
prices for industrial end users. The Energy Supply Regulator Board takes the necessary
measures. Electricity, natural gas and heat tariffs in 1998 were determined according to the
cost recovery method combined (for natural gas) with the marginal price method with
generation, transmission, distribution and sales costs treated separately. When tariffs are
approved it is assumed that user payments should cover:
the actual cost of energy generation, transmission, distribution and sales (purchase of
energy operation costs, wages, administrative cost);
the needed profit to pay taxes, interest rates and dividends;
capital contributions for the development of the company approved by Board.
In tariff setting methodologies, economic incentives must be incorporated for a company to
work more efficiently. The Board in 1999 has approved a new economic cost-based
methodology of tariff calculation for a three-year cycle.
In terms of protection of consumer interests, one of the most topical issues is the development
of regulations, which would comprise energy quality parameters and energy supply standards
and a penalty for low quality energy supply.
The Energy Supply Regulation Board approves tariffs for electrical energy, heat energy and
gas. At the end of 1997, the Board approved the average sales tariff of electricity of SJSC
Latvenergo and ten differentiated sales tariffs for groups of users. Differences in heat
energy tariffs exist for those users who have built local heat sources and have switched off
from the centralised heating system. The price for natural gas is fixed for residents and
transport. JSC Latvijas gze in supply contracts sets the specific price to each industrial
consumer within the framework of the maximal tariff approved by the Board. The Board
approved the maximum tariff for liquefied gas in 1998. The supplier within the maximum
limits of the tariff establishes sales prices of the liquefied gas. There are no essential
differences in prices for energy resources set by the free market.
8. THERMAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The share of district heat in final energy consumption in 1995 reached 38% and twice
exceeded that of electricity. In addition, a substantial share of the remaining final energy
consumption relates to conversion of primary energy resources into thermal energy at
decentralised systems (another 15%). Therefore, the thermal energy sector is a major area for
energy efficiency improvements.
The structure of achievable energy efficiency potential consists from 3 parts:
47% - in consumption;
31% - in transmission;
22% - in generation.
Implementation of the respective efficiency improvements would require investments of
approximately 2 billion LVL while aggregate efficiency in thermal energy systems would
improve by 65%.
Efficiency of thermal energy production. Energy efficiency measures for various groups of
boiler plants are evaluated and prioritised by experts. They calculate heat savings in different
projects or proposals of energy conservation measures as well as respective investments for
these improvements. This is shown in Table 1 below. There is a wide range of uncertainty
regarding the evaluation by different experts groups and for the realisation of similar projects.
These have been taken into account.

The efficiency of thermal energy transmission. Heat losses in networks are on average
between 25  30%, though in summer when only hot water is supplied they may exceed 50%.
Besides, heat losses are also influenced pipeline diameters, which do not correspond to those,
required by consumer loads. In case of network reconstruction heat losses in pre-insulated
pipelines that have appropriate diameters depend on network length and configuration and
range between 7% and 15%. Investments in network reconstruction depend on pipeline
diameters and they vary between 30 to 700 thousand LVL per kilometre (in 1995 prices).
There exists an Excel software for works in rock-wool isolating materials traded by the
company Paroc Latvia. This programme deals with isolation layers for heating pipes. It
calculates annual energy savings after isolation of various heat supply pipes by different
isolating materials layers as well as the payback period.
The efficiency of thermal energy consumption. Buildings are the major thermal energy
consumers. It is estimated that building space heating consumes some 65% of the total
delivered heat. The use of thermal insulation for the building envelope and the improvement
of the heating and ventilation systems offer an enormous potential for energy savings. One of
most important task is increasing the thermal resistance for various building constructions.
On 12 September 1991, the Ministry of Architecture and Construction issued Regulation
No.68 The improvement of thermal resistance values of building constructions. The annex
of this document established minimum thermal resistance values for buildings that are under
construction or will be reconstructed.
The Physical Energetics Institute contributed to the development of an Excel program Audit
for residential buildings. It calculates heat energy savings in houses in the case of fitting a
thermal isolation layer on the outside walls. This program calculates saved heat energy per
year and the payback period of expenses for isolation materials and work. With the help of
this programme it is possible to recommend a sequence of energy efficiency measures. The
costs of individual measures and their approximate payback periods are summarised below.

The biggest district heating system in Latvia is the one covering Riga (the capital of Latvia). It
supplies with heat about 600 000 inhabitants. In 1998, the Municipality of Riga accepted the
Concept of Riga featuring energy conservation measures (installation of heat meters and hot
and cold water meters, reconstruction of central heating junctions and others measures). This
Concept provides also for the modernisation of the main district heating company Rigas
Siltums and includes measures for decreasing the demand for heat energy in Riga. In 1998,
experts worked out the Reconstruction Project of Rigas District Heating (DH). The proposed
project aims at increasing the share of CHP from 47% to 81% and at closing inefficient boiler
plants. The implementation of this Reconstruction Project will lower the present level of dust,
CO2, SO2, NOx and others emissions. Reduction of CO2 emissions due to this project
corresponds to 10% of the total CO2 emissions of Latvia (or 2.5% of the total CO2 emissions
of the three Baltic countries).
The criterion for foreign partners is maximal profitability of the project. For example,
Municipality of Riga planned in 1998 to accept a credit from Denmark (company Danfoss)
amounting to 2 million LVL over 10 years with an interest rate 6  7% per year and with
some privileges.
Inflation was characteristic for the beginning of the transition period as was the inability of
inhabitants and industrial customers to pay for energy. This led to large debts by household
and industry sectors. The Municipality of Riga has addressed this problem and partly solved it
in 1996. The Municipality itself has not debts for heating. The debts of inhabitants are
addressed in the Guidelines of providing assistance to indigent inhabitants.
Investments in energy sector efficiency. Efficiency improvements in heating systems are
closely connected with investments in generation, networks and improvements of building
efficiency. Forecast of investments take into account that funds consumed by the thermal
energy sector will be taken away from other sectors and GDP growth would decrease. The
permissible amount of investments in energy projects, which would not decrease GDP
growth, is 5% of all investments. Analysis shows that during 1997  2020, the thermal energy
sector may afford aggregate investments of some 826 mill LVL or 971 mill LVL according to
different scenarios. This would improve the total efficiency by respectively 28% and 39%
compared with 1997.
9. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHP
The energy framework conditions in Latvia are defined by the Energy Policy in the Power
Sector, as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 11 September 2001. This document
provides general principles for the development of the electricity production, of which the
following are of major importance from the point of view of CHP development:
The Government has stated that supply from power plants under the jurisdiction of Latvia
shall cover 80-90% of the total national electricity consumption until 2008;
Since CHP is one of the most efficient power production technologies, and since the
development of CHP significantly contributes to the defined objective, the Government has
also stated that CHP plants shall receive support in the form of guaranteed purchase of
produced electricity at a price approved by the Regulator of Public Utilities.
The main document of the energy sector  the Energy Law  also provides support for CHP
plants. Article 41 stipulates that the Cabinet of Ministers shall establish common requirements
for CHP plants, common procedures for fixing the price for the produced electricity, and a
procedure of purchasing this electricity. The Cabinet of Ministers adopted Regulation No 9
Requirements for CHP plants and the procedure for fixing the price when purchasing surplus
of the produced electricity on 8 January 2002 according to the abovementioned Article 41.
Basic provisions include:
1. Requirements for the efficiency, regimes, and safety of CHP plants. These define the
criteria, which the CHP plant shall comply with in order to qualify for the support provided by
the legislation. These criteria are as follows:
= Total efficiency of CHP plant shall not be below 80%;
= At least 75% of the heat produced by the CHP plant
= shall be delivered to the district heating system.
2. According to the Regulation, the fixed purchase price applies only for the surplus of
electricity i.e. the amount after self-consumption of the plant has been deducted;
3. Principles of fixing the electricity purchase price are based on three criteria:
= Fuel used in the plant (fossil or renewable);
= Electric capacity of the CHP plant;
= Operating regime of the CHP plant. The Regulation states that the plant can work in
CHP or condensation regime or both simultaneously. Purchase price mechanisms
provided in the Regulation apply only in the case of electricity produced in CHP
regime. Therefore the CHP and condensation regimes shall be separated for the
purpose of fixing the price. Electricity produced in condensation regime can be sold
for the price agreed by the parties. Price fixing mechanisms are described in more
detail in the next Chapter.
It must be noted that the mentioned Regulation does not refer to the CHP plants that have
received their licences before 1 June 2001 and have started operation in the time period stated
in the licence. Until the licence or the approved price has expired, electricity produced by
these plants shall be purchased according to the provisions in force before 1 June 2001.
10. ELECTRICITY AND HEAT PURCHASE PRICES
The purchase price for electricity in some specific CHP cases is strictly fixed in the Cabinet of
Ministers Regulation No 9 Requirements for CHP plants and the procedure for fixing the
price when purchasing surplus of the produced electricity of 8 January 2002. In other cases,
the Regulator determines the purchase price. The Regulator, according to the Law on the
Regulators of Public Utilities, always determines the price of the heat produced in CHP
plants. An overview is given in the following Table where:
C  purchase price;
Tav  average electricity sales tariff in the licence area of the system operator that
purchases the electricity produced in the CHP plant.

As the Table shows, the economic possibilities of CHP plants depend to a large extent on the
price fixing principles that are to be defined by the Regulator, as the Law on Regulators of
Public Utilities states that the Regulator shall fix the prices according to its own methodology.
The Regulator is still working on the price fixing methodology for electricity and heat
produced in CHP plants. It was planned to approve the methodology by June 2002.
The basic principles of the methodology are as follows:
1. Generally, the CHP plant must avoid or substitute electricity and heat production costs,
which occur when these energy types are produced separately in the most efficient alternative
way. Thus any CHP plant has a price ceiling for the two products, electricity and heat. This
means that the products produced in the CHP plant can only be sold for the price lower or
equal to the determined price ceiling.
2. The price ceiling for electricity produced in CHP plants with installed electric capacity not
exceeding 4,0 MW is determined according to the Cabinet of Ministers Regulation No 9
Requirements for CHP plants and the procedure for fixing the price when purchasing surplus
of the produced electricity of 8 January 2002. For other CHP plants, the price ceiling is equal
to long-term marginal costs of electricity in condensation power plant of maximum efficiency.
Depending on the planned or used fuel of the CHP plant, the long-term marginal costs are
calculated either for gas or coal condensation plants. The Regulator provides assumptions and
entry data needed for the calculations.
3. The operation of a CHP plant avoids heat production costs of a quite specific boiler plant as
opposed to the electricity production where the assumed condensation plant is rather generally
defined. Therefore there are a larger number of options provided for the heat produced in
CHP plants. These options cover possible cases in the actual conditions of Latvia. As to heat,
the price ceiling to be applied shall be found by evaluating the possible CHP cases from two
aspects:
= What fuel is planned to be used in the CHP plant and what fuel is used in the boiler
plant the costs of which will be avoided by the respective CHP plant?
= What items of heat costs will be avoided by the respective CHP plant?
4. Thus, when determining the price ceiling for heat, marginal costs can be calculated in
several ways. The basic principle for selecting the method is that the CHP plant shall prevent
the best alternative heat production option. For the calculation of costs in the alternative boiler
plant, in most cases the utilisation of natural gas will be assumed. As to cost items to be
avoided, the following options are possible:
= the CHP plant will avoid long-term marginal costs of a boiler plant of appropriate
capacity. This will be applied in cases when the construction of a CHP plant will allow
closing down of inefficient and old boiler plant, or it is planned to build the CHP in a
place with no existing heat production capacities;
= the CHP plant substitutes for inefficient or old boiler plant capacities or prevent the
need to increase the capacity of the existing boiler plant. In this case the calculation of
long-term marginal costs will include only the investments for the part of the capacity
to be replaced;
= the construction of a CHP plant is not substituting for capacities of an existing boiler
plant but is decreasing the load and hours of operation of the existing capacities. In
this case, CHP plant is not avoiding capacity costs but only the energy item of heat
production costs. The price ceiling for heat is the energy item of heat price;
= the CHP plant is constructed by installing a steam turbine in an existing steam boiler
plant. From the point of view of heat supply, neither capacity nor energy costs are
avoided. Therefore, the price ceiling for heat of such a CHP plant is the heat price
calculated for this CHP plant as for a boiler plant without the turbine according to the
heat tariff calculation methodology in force.
The described principles of fixing the electricity and heat purchase price are essential for the
potential owner of a CHP plant: the project will only be economically viable
= if the owner can cover all operating costs of the plant,
= pays back the loans according to their contracted terms,
= and secures a return of investments in an acceptable time period while selling both
products at a price equal or below the price ceiling fixed according to the approved
methodology.

III. What solutions are being put into practice?
Predominantly country- and sector-specific solutions,
with an evolutionary and international touch
1. from centralization to decentralization
= at present, in PL 3000, in SK 1200 heat suppliers
= by contrast, centralization prevails in BY and partly BG
2. from State- or municipality-owned systems to a range of ownership and
management models
= such as municipal agencies, limited liability companies, joint stock companies,
public/private partnerships, ESCOs, industrial self-producers
= privatisation: promoted by easier access to capital market and expertise but
impeded by old debt, receivables, political interference in tarification and
investments
3. from vertical integration to unbundling
= towards separation of generators and distribution grids (may complicate system
operation)
= third party access to heat distribution grids not practiced
4. from subsidized, lump-sum tariffs to full-cost, metered tariffs
= so far substantial increases of heat prices
= full cost coverage, no subsidies only in EE, LV, LT; BG intends to phase-out
subsidies before 2004
= implications: social hardships, payment arrears, surge of self-production, surge
of peak demand for electricity
= H: law stipulates full metering by 2003 (expected savings: 15  25 %)
= cross-subsidization still prevails between industrial and residential, and small
and big industrial customers
5. from ad hoc decisions to internationally harmonized legislation
= everywhere laws on energy, environment and efficiency
= in H, LV, LT specific DH/CHP laws
= everywhere regulatory authorities (national, provincial or municipal) to deal
with DH/CHP
o licensing
o tariffs
o development planning
o incentives for renewables, co-generation and efficiency improvement
(audit, building codes)
= approximation to EU policies and standards
= application of Energy Charter Treaty provisions on non-discrimination of
foreign investors (land ownership, concessions, licenses, dispute settlement),
but still exceptions
= assistance through Phare, USAID, IBRD, EBRD
6. from DH-specific policies to local energy systems
= PL, RO oblige municipalities to develop policies for local energy system
IV. What remains to be done?
Implement intentions, prepare for the long-term!
by policy makers:
implement intentions !
= generally, secure fair competition by eliminating preferential pricing, taxation and
regulatory regimes for competing fuels
= pursue declared DH/CHP policies (secondary legislation)
= encourage ownership change, price deregulation and competition in the DH/CHP
market
= secure non-discrimination of foreign investors
= encourage privatisation by eliminating old debts inherited from central planning and
compensate for foregone revenues as a result of social policy (receivables)
= eliminate subsidies and cross-subsidies; finance social benefits from the State budget
= establish a regulator with competence for all grid-based energies
= develop alternatives to TPA to heat distribution networks
= abstain from operating, or politically interfering in, the DH/CHP business
prepare for the long-term !
= encourage the development of local energy systems on the basis of life cycle cost
= for the time being, avoid internalisation of external costs into heat tariffs, seen its
unfavourable social implications and the uncertainties surrounding the concept
RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZING
DISTRICT HEATING/CHP INDUSTRIES IN CEE:
THE EXPERIENCE GAINED BY MVV ENERGIE AG
by Dr. Jrg Matthies and Christophe Thielemans, MVV, Brussels
1. THE ROLE OF A PRIVATE INVESTOR  MVV - IN DH SYSTEMS
MVV Consultants and Engineers is a subsidiary of MVV Energie AG specialized in providing
consulting and engineering services to public and private clients at the international level. The
company has a world-wide experience in almost in 100 countries, with a focus on Central and
Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union. The know-how of the Group in the utility sector
includes district heating and cogeneration. Our competitive edge is the combination of handson utility operational experience with top consulting/engineering know-how. MVV offers
commercial and technical solutions for utility operations, for example through management
contracts, loss reduction programmes, improvement of billing and collection. MVV also
provide technical assistance and advice on sector and utility restructuring, regulations, private
sector participation and institutional reforms, including training and capacity building.
Clients comprise the World Bank, EBRD, EIB, European Commission, United Nations,
energy companies, national ministries, regional and local authorities.
Amongst recently completed and new assignments are the following: Restructuring of District
Heating (Uzbekistan), Kievenergo Institutional Study (Ukraine), Urban Heating Restructuring
(Russia), Assistance to the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (Turkey), Management
Contract for the Energy Sector (Kosovo), Restructuring of Energy Sector (Georgia).
2. MVVS POLICY CONCLUSIONS
MVVs experience as an investor in central and eastern Europe has prompted it to
advocate a number of policy recommendations:
Regarding the sequence of reforms: a well established regulatory framework is
essential for successful privatization
Heat tariffs must ensure cost recovery and are not to be used as social policy
instrument to subsidize services for low-income customers
Payment discipline and cash collection must be on track. Very low income levels
are detrimental to immediate privatization
A long-term joint commitment for partnership with municipalities helps
substantially overcome barriers such as tariffs and payments. Consequently, full
takeover of assets is not always desirable
Investments must generate a sufficient rate of return depending on country risk
shortened version of the presentation given by Mr. Thielemans, MVV Consultants and Engineers, Brussels, 9,
av. Jules Csar ; the full version can be obtained by contacting the author at: c.thielemans@consultants.mvv.de
Involvement of merchant banks and guarantee schemes (e.g. through GEF) are
helpful to attract borrowed money and not just only equity
IFI loans are desirable but terms and conditions are central elements for
attractiveness
Other forms of public-private participation are helpful to gradually approach
privatization such as service and management contracts to upgrade the operational
efficiency of the system and thus the value of assets.
CofLITHUANIA: REORGANIZATION OF KAUNAS ENERGY
AND PREPARATION OF THE PRIVATIZATION OF KAUNAS CHP
by Rimantas Bakas 10
1. INTRODUCTION
On August 15, 1997, after the reorganization of JSC Lithuania Energy, a special joint stock
company Kaunas Energy was established comprising the former branches of JSC Lithuania
Energy, i. e. Kaunas Power Plant and Kaunas District Heating Network. A shareholders
meeting, a supervisory board, a management board and the management direct the company.
The Municipality of Kaunas is the main shareholder (85,21% shares).
Kaunas Energy is active in
-heat and electricity production;
-heat transmission;
-heat distribution;
-non-core activities
production of pre-insulated pipes
peat mining.
The company operates as the main heat and steam supplier to the city of Kaunas (the second
largest town in Lithuania) and the districts of Kaunas and Jurbarkas.
The prices of fuel and energy resources rise constantly in Lithuania, but at the same time, there
are no strategic investments to modernize the district-heating sector. Costs of heat production,
supply and distribution also constantly rise as environmental requirements increase. The
technological basis of the energy economy is not renewed sufficiently fast due to the lack of
financial resources.
2. NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY FOR LITHUANIA
On October 5, 1999, the Lithuanian Parliament approved a new National Energy Strategy for
Lithuania, which sets out broad principles for the development and management of the
Lithuanian energy sector for the next twenty years. The National Energy Strategy, which is
revised every five years, includes measures designed to prepare the energy sector for future
integration into the EU. It calls for the reorganisation and eventual privatisation of the
electricity sector, as well as greater efficiency and market liberalisation. The National Energy
Strategy sets out the following objectives for the development of the energy sector in
Lithuania:
Reliable and safe energy supply at least cost;
Enhancement of energy efficiency;
Improvement of energy sector management and implementation of market economy
principles;
Reduction of the negative impact on the environment, nuclear safety;
Integration into the energy systems of the EU; and
Regional co-operation and collaboration.
Project Manager, Kaunas Energy Company; contact: rimasb@ke.balt.net
Currently a new Heat Law is being drafted, which will set out in more detail the market
structure and regulatory framework for the sector.
On 20 July 2000, an Electricity Law was passed, which set out the main principles of the
future electricity market. Pursuant to an amendment passed on 26 June 2001, the new
Electricity Law came into force on 1 January 2002. The Ministry of Economy and the
National Control Commission for Prices and Energy have issued the requisite secondary
legislation mandated by the new Electricity Law.
3. PREPARATION OF A LEASING TENDER FOR THE KAUNAS DISTRICT
HEATING SECTOR
In 1996, Kaunas Energy and Kaunas City, together with the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), analyzed the possibility of attracting investors into
Kaunas Energy. The decision was to invite interested participants through an international
tender to bid for the conclusion of a Lease Agreement that would allow the leaser to manage
and operate heat production and distribution in Kaunas while providing the necessary
investments.
The preparation of the leasing project took place during 19962000. The main goal of the
project was to improve the efficiency of the Kaunas district heating system and the quality of
life and of the environment in Kaunas City. This would be achieved through more effective
management, cost control, billing and a broad investment plan. It was foreseen to finance the
investment plan with funds from the EBRD, European Social Development Bank (CEB), the
strategic investor and income of the Company. The intention was to preserve the current
centralized heat supply system and heat market, enhance combined production of electricity
and heat (CHP), and increase sales of heat to the maximum possible level in Kaunas.
The international tender was published. In 1999, the Tender Commission received
confirmation from the following companies to participate in the Tender:
Vattenfall (Sweden)
Dalkia (France)
Elyo (France)
Steag (Germany)
The Tender Commission announced that the proposals from Elyo and Steag will not be
considered as they do not fulfill all the requirements of the Tender. The main inadequacy was
the non-payment of the required deposit. The Commission decided to evaluate only the
proposals from Dalkia and Vattenfall as qualified Tender participants.
The Kaunas City Council, in the general shareholders meeting, declared Vattenfall AB as
Tender winner for the project.
Next, the Commission of Investment Projects of the Ministry of Economy considered the
project. A positive decision of this Commission is the first necessary step for receiving the
State Guarantee for the loans, respectively, of 128 million LTL (32 million USD) from the
EBRD and 40 million LTL (10 million USD) from the European Development Council Bank
(CEB) on behalf of the State. The Commission gave in principle a positive answer on the
condition that the investment plan would be specified and further explained, and that specified
data for the current period would be submitted.
In March 2000, the authorized representatives of both, Kaunas Energy and Vattenfall AB,
initialed the Lease Agreement with signatures on every page.
On May 31, 2000, the President of Vattenfall AB sent a letter indicating the withdrawal of
Vattenfall AB from the project. The Company wished to concentrate on Vattenfall projects
already under implementation in Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic. The withdrawal
from the Kaunas project was primarily caused by a certain shift in Vattenfalls European
growth strategy.
Subsequently, the mayor of Kaunas sent a letter to the second winner informing it that
Vattenfall AB had withdrawn from the project and inviting it to negotiate as second qualified
Tender participant. Negotiations began in accordance with the Tender requirements regarding
the conclusion of the Lease Agreement, after the question of the proposed deposit had been
solved.
The winner of second place in the Tender, during two months,
= did not submit a specific proposal and did not pay the deposit;
= did not specify the possible heating tariff in its letters (only a few numbers
between 10.44 and 13 ctLTL/kW were mentioned);
= changed its mind regarding the duration of the lease term (from 15 to 25 years);
= did not submit the investment plan.
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the official consultant to the Kaunas side in the preparations of the
Lease Agreement since July, 1999) recommended keeping the Tender conditions.
Subsequently, in August 2000, the Kaunas Municipality drew the following conclusions:
- it was impossible to negotiate along the lines of the initial Tender conditions;
- in order to continue the search for ways to implement the project, it was necessary to
change some important conditions of the initial Tender; the only legally proper way to
change the framework of the initial conditions of the Tender was to cancel the Tender.
Taking into consideration these conclusions, Kaunas Municipality decided to cancel the
leasing project. This decision was consistent with the aims of both, the Municipality and the
Bank, to ensure full transparency of the implementation of the Tender as well as consistency
with the legal norms and current international practice. The most important conclusion was
that this decision opened opportunities to search for other ways of the modernization the
heating sector, differing from the framework of the initial, unsuccessful Tender.
4. NEW STRATEGY IN KAUNAS ENERGY
In 2000, Kaunas Energy adopted a new management structure and developed a new
strategy:
= A stronger customer orientation;
= Stimulating the companys internal resources;
= Reducing energy cost;
= New approaches to attract financial recourses;
= Implementation of advanced know how and good practice;
= Study of new technologies and unconventional fuels;
= Energy market planning and development of new alternatives.
This new strategy resulted in the financial stabilization financial of the company.

At present, Kaunas Energy is a vertically integrated heat and electricity generation and heat
distribution company that provides premises with water heating services to residents and
businesses in Kaunas and Kaunas region. The Company consists of the headquarters and 5
branches: Kaunas District Heating Network, Kauno Elektrine, Jurbarkas District Heating
Network, Kaunas Energy Services and Naujasodzio Energija. The Companys generation
capacity includes thermal power plants in Kaunas (Kaunas CHP and Petrasiunu CHP, the
latter with a total installed electricity and heat generation capacity of 8 MW and 379 MW
respectively), four district boiler-houses in Kaunas and 14 regional boiler-houses. The total
installed capacity of the Companys generating units is 2,727 MW, consisting of 178 MW of
electricity generation and 2,549 MW of heat generation. All electricity produced by Kauno
Elektrine as a by-product of heat generation is sold to Lithuanian Power Company (LPC). The
parties agree upon quantities and price for electricity on an annual basis. According to the
Electricity Law, effective from 1 January 2002, electricity could be sold to the other public or
private electricity suppliers.

6. PRIVATISATION OF KAUNAS CHP
In 2001, the Municipality of Kaunas started the process of privatising Kaunas CHP by way of
asset sale to a strategic investor involved in the same or similar business.
The objectives of Kaunas Energy for selling Kaunas CHP are as follows:
= To attract a reliable investor/partner for the future.
= To ensure tariff (price) stability for heat energy consumers.
= To reduce the financial burden on Kaunas Energy.
= To allow Kaunas Energy to concentrate on further development of heat transmission
and distribution.
= To meet the goals of the National Energy Strategy.
By selecting an investor, the Company will seek to achieve as many as possible of the above
objectives.
In turn, an investment in Kaunas CHP is considered to be attractive to investors for at least the
following reasons:
= A new market and regulatory structure is being created in Lithuania in accordance
with EU principles;
= Lithuania is among the fastest growing countries in central and eastern Europe;
= Lithuania welcomes foreign investment and has successfully completed a number of
high profile privatisations to major international companies;
= Kaunas city is one of the two largest cities in Lithuania and Kaunas CHP is the
countrys second largest combined heat and power plant;
= Lithuanias commitment to close the first reactor of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant
(currently providing 70% of the countrys electricity needs) in 2005 and to decide
upon the closure of the second reactor in the same year, is expected to provide an
opportunity to beneficially utilize electricity generating capacities of Kaunas CHP;
= Kaunas Energy is ready to provide the investor with concrete assurances as to the
quantities of heat to be supplied by Kaunas CHP to Kaunas Energy; and
= Highly experienced and qualified personnel work at Kaunas CHP.
As of November 2001, Kaunas Energy and Kaunas Municipality started preparing the new
project. Kaunas Energy intends to attract an investor for Kaunas CHP by way of selling its
assets. For this purpose, the Company has set out a transparent and competitive tender
process.
During the first phase, applicants (Investors) wishing to participate in the tender were
required to submit information in accordance with the instructions. In particular, investors
were required to provide evidence that they meet the minimum qualification criteria. If
investors did not comply with those, they were allowed to form a consortium with other
investors complying with the minimum qualification criteria.
Qualified investors or consortia (name of leader) that met the minimum qualification criteria
are set out below:

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CO-GENERATION IN SLOVENIA
by Hinko Solinc
The Government of Slovenia has stated in its Resolution on the Strategy of Energy Use and
Supply of Slovenia, adopted by the National Assembly (Parliament) in January 1996, that it
wishes to promote and support further development of co-generation in Slovenia. In the
document it is recognised that with co-generation energy can be saved, the environment can
be improved, costs can be cut and new, competitive actors can be introduced into the energy
market. In quantitative terms the Resolution sets a target to double the volume of qualified
power production (electric power production attaining very high efficiency or utilising waste
or renewable sources in an economically and environmentally acceptable manner) by 2010.
To this volume, co-generation is to contribute the main part.
At the end of the 1999, the Slovenian Parliament adopted a new Energy law (Energetski
zakon, Official. Gazette RS, No. 79/1999, 78/2000). The Law fundamentally changed the
energy sector in Slovenia. The main choices made in the Energy law of 1999 are
= electricity market opening,
= regulated TPA with no single-buyer entity,
= market supervision by an independent regulator; the Agency for Energy.
The Agency for Energy will also set prices for network access. Eligible customers are all
final consumers with a connecting capacity of over 41 kW, and all distribution companies.
The distribution companies, under a public service regime, will service the remaining captive
customers, mainly households. The market will be open for imports as of January 1st 2003
under a reciprocity clause. The gas market will be liberalised at a slower pace. All electricity
producers, including autoproducers, will be eligible consumers for natural gas from January
1st 2003. Gas network access will be negotiable with providers of the transmission and
distribution public services.
No provision exists for the introduction of an energy tax. Such policy instrument, if different
in design or earmarking from other taxes (e.g. excise tax), would need an additional legal
basis. The CO2 tax (briefly commented later) is based on the Environment Protection Act
(1993).
The energy policy, through appropriate measures, shall give priority to the use of renewable
types of energy and energy resources who pollute the environment less. The energy policy
shall be focused on eliminating the consequences and replacing environmentally unfavourable
technologies of using energy resources, whose combustion products accelerate the greenhouse
effect (CO2) and emit nitric oxide (NO) into the atmosphere. On the national level, the energy
policy shall encourage the use of alternative resources and, on the local level, of smaller units.

STRATEGY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF DISCTRICT HEATING IN BULGARIA FOR 2000-2005
by Mrs. Lubka Georgieva
SUMMARY
The rehabilitation of district heating is a proven, effective and ecological solution for
heating and hot water supply to high-density urban areas. Alternative heating systems
result in considerably higher cost to the customers and require larger amount of
investments.
The technical and technological preconditions are available, which enable residential and
public consumers to regulate and reduce their consumption through installation of modern
substations and allocators of the consumed energy.
The operational and heat transmission costs can be considerably reduced through
reasonable investments in rehabilitation and modernization of the heat supply systems.
The implementation of many well prepared investment programs create a real opportunity
to phase out subsidies after 4-5 years.
The payment system can be improved through:
Contracting of the heat supply with legal representatives of the apartment owners;
Introduction of a dual-tariff for heat payment;
Adequate change of the legislation.
The social assistance for households with low income can be improved through
redirection of the subsidies from the producers to the consumers; this will have a
favourable impact on demand and on heat suppliers.
The joint effect of the above key measures results in affordable heating cost and the
conversion of the Bulgarian heat supply companies into modern, flexible and viable
heating systems; these allow heat supply to correspond to the individual needs and
requirements of the consumer.
CURRENT STATUS
Heat supply systems aim at providing a public service to building floor property owners
through the generation, transmission and distribution of heat. This determines the public
nature of heat supply, as compared to individual heating.
District heating is an activity of regional importance, related to the infrastructure. It provides a
key communal/residential service to the population, the public organizations and companies
in the respective living areas.
Technical characteristics of district heating in Bulgaria
Currently there are 22 operating heat supply companies in the country operating in 21 cities
(there are 2 in Plovdiv). About 570,000 homes with 1,650 thousand occupants are heated
Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources, Sofia; contact: lubka@doe.bg
centrally, which is about 18 percent of the countrys population. The public buildings with
central heat supply service 243 thousand apartments.
The DH company of Sofia, which is larger than all other companies together, supplies about
350 thousand apartments with about 950 thousand people, as well as public buildings with a
heated volume equal to the volume of 160 thousand apartments.
Nine companies  in Sofia, Plovdiv North, Pernik, Pleven, Sliven, Shumen, Gabrovo,
Kasanlak, and Rousse, have combined heat and power generation (CHP).
The DH/CHPs generate annually about 1.8-1.9 million MWh of electricity, and about 1113,000 thousand MWh of heat. To generate this amount, they burn about 1 million t of coal,
130-160, 000 t of residual oil and about 1.4 billion cm of natural gas.
Fourteen companies are using gas as the main fuel. Twelve of them, if necessary or if
economically reasonable, have the technical possibility to use residual oil. The companies in
Kasanlak, V.Tarnovo, Samokov, and Tryavna, cannot use other fuels than fuel oil. Those in
Pernik, Sliven, Gabrovo, and Isrketz burn mainly local coal; Gabrovo has capacities to burn
fuel oil too, and Sliven  natural gas also.
Financial-economic characteristics of district heating
The DH/CHPs are selling heat to the population at prices below cost, fixed by the government
uniformly for the country as a whole. All other economic entities pay marginal prices formed
on the basis of full operating cost and some profit margin. The difference between the
production cost and the fixed prices to the population is covered by a central subsidy.
The pre-subsidy loss of the DH sector for 1997 amounted to 228,350 thousand leva, for 1998
it was 135,952 thousand leva, and for 1999  52,663 (for 1999, the fuel prices which are the
main expense item were the lowest for the reported period).
Liquid fuels are the main price-formation factor for gas. Sharp reductions in the quotations of
liquid fuels were observed on the international markets in 2000. This is the main reason for
the expected loss in 2000 of (only) about 99 million leva, which compares with significantly
higher average sale prices for gas and residual oil in the previous year. These financial results
are accompanied by the following negative trends:
= Shrinkage of the heat market resulting in the disconnection from district heating of large
groups of customers, mainly residential (the disconnected volume corresponded to over
30 percent of the total heated volume);
= Decrease of the collection rate of sold heat, with the annual ratio (for 1999) of reported
receivables to accrued/billed revenues reaching (only) 50 percent;
= Change of the demand structure as a result of the sharp decline of heat supply to the
industry due to the termination or shrinkage of the activities of the industrial consumers:
this leads to a growing share of heat sold to the population at lower fixed prices.
The large amount of subsidies, especially for 2000-2001, can be explained by the significant
increase of fuel prices during the current year and the decision to freeze the fixed heat price to
the level of its social affordability. This affected the budget procedure for 2000 as follows:
Gas price  170.58 leva for 1000 cm (net of VAT). Starting from 01/01/2000 it was
increased to 190 leva, and from 06/01/2000 it reached 223.33 leva. The current price level is
more than 76 percent higher than forecast for 2000;
Residual oil price  203.74 leva/t (net of VAT). The current price is 347 leva/t (net of
VAT), or by 58.7 percent higher;
Heat prices for households  envisaged to reach 39.44 by July 1, 2000 leva/MWh by
implementing the Financial recovery programs and the Restructuring Plan and eliminating
the subsidies (net of VAT). The current price to be in place till mid-next year is by 30
percent lower.
II. APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTING THE MID-TERM STRATEGY FOR
DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRICT HEATING TILL 2005, AND ACTION PLAN.
The Strategy and the Action Plan are prepared on the basis of three main issues:
1. Investigation of the potential viability of the commercial companies on the basis of
reported and forecasted technical-economical data:
- marketing analyses on the basis of demand and supply change;
- cost-benefit analyses and capabilities of the companies concerned;
- financial analyses, including sensitivity analyses of revenues, costs and net income;
- break-even analysis of production depending on demand and supply, and heat prices.
2. Development possibilities for district heating on the basis of two approaches:
- restrictive, without additional investments over the accrued depreciation resulting in
maintaining the already established trends;
- positive, directed to re-connect part of the customers (90 percent) through reasonable
investments targeted to reduce the costs for supplier and heat bills, and phasing out
of the direct operational subsidies.
Applying this approach and with World Bank assistance, the following measures were
undertaken:
- Investment projects were developed for 8 companies to undergo major restructuring
and to receive significant investments beginning from early 2001, thus restoring their
commercial viability during the next 4 years, including debt service on loans received.
These DH/CHPs receive about 80 percent of the operating subsidies for the sector;
undertaking investments in conformity with the developed investment projects will allow
them to supply heat at least cost.
- For three small DH/CHPs, Iskretz, Bedek and Losnitza, the central government
subsidies will be withdrawn from the beginning of the next heating season due to the high
per unit cost of production.
- The potential viability of the remaining 11 companies will be assessed till end-October
and for some of them the subsidies will be withdrawn. The analyses show that currently
subsidies can be withdrawn for 5 of them till mid-2001.
- Starting of privatization and/or transfer of the companies to the municipalities, for
which subsidies will be withdrawn before 2004.
3. Key elements of the restructuring
The key elements for restructuring are:
= solving the problem of disconnection of customers through a dual tariff structure of
the prices for households (including a fixed charge for all occupants living in a
building, according to actual consumption), to be introduced from January 1, 2002
with an interim period of obligatory payment by the disconnected customers;
= allowing DH/CHPs to disconnect buildings with more than 50 percent of disconnected
customers, according to the Energy Act;
= transferring the financial burden to the municipalities in 2001 in the cities with
district heating.
III. INVESTMENT NEEDS
1. Technical/technological (system priorities)
Priority is the improvement of the efficiency of the entire system: in the heat sources, heat
transmission network, and substations.
2. Economic parameters
Investment needs are defined on the basis of economic indicators: payback period and net
present values. According to the analyses made, the most urgent priorities are the following:
Rehabilitation of the substations;
= Replacement of the old sections of the transmission network;
= Rehabilitation of low-efficient heat sources;
Upgrading with co-generation as the most efficient and economical way of energy
generation. Seen the general context of the fuel balance, the use of gas turbines with parallel
rehabilitation of the remaining heat sources of the country, will be a stabilizing factor for gas
demand in general and particularly for Bulgargaz;
Installing allocators and thermostatic valves, which allow the individual regulation of the
apartments and a billing based on actual consumption. This equipment will stimulate
disconnected customers to re-connect. The DH/CHPs cannot be direct investors to install this
equipment, as building installations upstream building substations are not property of the
companies. To the extent that such investment is beneficial to the customers and represents a
stabilizing factor of the market, it would be in the interest of the companies to support the
measures within their capabilities.
NEED OF OPERATING SUBSIDIES
The subsidies will phase out in 2004 as reasonable investments are implemented. Starting
from 2005, the companies will be able to operate self-sufficiently and in a commercially
viable manner, including servicing of debt.
The financial support for the DH/CHPs should secure the heat season 2000-2001. For this
purpose about 91,821 thousand leva are needed for 2000 (currently only 38,653 thousand leva
are provided for in the budget, and additional funds at 53,168 are needed). The needed
subsidy for 2001 will be determined till end-July, the initial forecast amounting to 80,000
thousand leva.
FINANCING OF THE INVESTMENTS
The investment financing for the first DH rehabilitation projects was discussed and
coordinated in advance with the World Bank and the EBRD. The first projects were prepared
for Sofia and Pernik; the second stage includes five cities with feasibility studies prepared in
1998-99 for Plovdiv, Pleven, Rousse, Bourgas, and Kasanlak.
The sources of financing of the various components of the heat supply systems can be defined
as follows:
= Investments for the substations, transmission network, and some improvements at the
heat sources can be financed by international financial institutions like the World
Bank and EBRD, and partially by local financial sources;
International financial institutions, government and other energy efficiency programs,
EU, private initiatives, can finance the consumer installations, thermostatic valves and
allocators;
New co-generation upgrades have to be financed mainly by third parties, private
investors, etc.; in this type of production, a binding power purchase agreement is a
precondition for attracting private interest. Well-prepared investment memoranda
should enhance this interest.
KEY ISSUES OF THE PRICING POLICY
The fixed prices should not be raised for a certain period of time, if the impact on the average
family bills is not compensated by a respective reduction in consumption due to the
installation of modern substations, thermostatic valves and allocators, as well as by direct
assistance to the consumers.
= The adjustment of the prices and cost should be achieved not later than 2004. This
goal can be achieved if the necessary investments are done.
= The dual tariff with capacity and energy charge will apply for all consumers and will
cover the costs from the heat source to the substations (including the cost of the
substation). The tariff components should reflect the actual allocation of costs between
the variable and fixed costs.
= The price has to rise according to the income level. The elaboration envisages mainly
an increase of the fixed price by 10 percent each July. Thus the average annual
increase will come to 3.33 percent, the additional burden to be felt from beginning of
the heating season 2001-02. The effect of the investment measures will start giving
benefits in 2002, and till end-2005 will be reflected in lower bills due to revenue
optimization.
= The price regulation should guarantee fair distribution of the benefits between the
companies and the consumers. To foster the investments into the heat supply systems,
the regulation should provide incentives to the companies.
= A precise cost distribution should be secured at the co-generation plants including
respective dispatch rules of the CHPs.
VII.
NECESSARY LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATION FRAMEWORK
Amendments to the Energy and Energy Efficiency Act (EEEA):
= Introduction of percent payment for supplied heat to the buildings by the disconnected
consumers;
= Contracting with the owners in multi-dwelling and commercial buildings;
= Forced disconnection of heat supply for non-payments, if the owners association has
not paid the bills (after a specified period).
Secondary legislation
The ordinances regulating the activities of the district-heating sector should have
provisions regarding:
= Disconnection of buildings in case of non-payment or partial payment;
Creation of proper price and other regulators for district heating (licenses, etc.);
Payment in equal installments of the capacity charge and monthly payment of
consumed heat;
The installation of allocators and fair cost allocation within the buildings;
Creation of a respective regulatory network to foster private investments into cogeneration capacities and demand side management;
Enforcing the provision of Art. 3 of Cabinet of Ministers Decree 147/1999
concerning the use of investments credits by companies implementing financial
recovery programs. The same Decree to be amended allowing short-term credits by
the companies for providing the necessary fuel amount;
Updating of the norms of designing new heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
installations.
VIII. SOCIAL PROTECTION
= Creation of organizational and financial/economic conditions for enforcing of
paragraph 6(3) of the Transitional and Closing Provisions of the EEEA, and possibility
for energy savings through proper programs;
= Granting of targeted assistance for heating to end-consumers  people and families
eligible under the conditions of the Rules for Application of the Social Protection Act;
= Developing an effective mechanism through which the assistance is provided via the
entity billing the end-consumer. This can be owners associations, if established, or the
DH/ CHPs;
= Increasing the number of assisted consumers with low income, subscribers of the
DH/CHPs, who due to financial reasons have fully disconnected or are heating only
one room; this enhanced assistance will support maximally the market of the DH
services;
= Re-direction of the direct operating subsidies to the consumers through proper
mechanisms;
= Assistance to the consumers with low incomes to be raised according to the reduction
of the operating subsidies of the DH/CHPs.
CONCLUSION
This Action Plan will improve the viability and efficiency of district heating through the
envisaged reasonable investments and other structural and organizational measures.
Implementation requires a related institutional support by:
= Providing the necessary subsidies and investments;
= Improving the legislative framework;
= The respective authorized state bodies assessing the terms of privatization of
DH/CHPs with a view to maximizing the benefits to the consumers through
improved and effective services
This strategy is elaborated on the basis of EU Directive 93/76/EEk concerning the reduction
of emissions of carbon dioxide through improved energy efficiency (savings).
COMBINED ELECTRICITY AND HEAT GENERATI0N
IN RUSSIA:
EFFICIENT WAY OF GREENING FOSSIL FUELS
by G. G. Olkhovsky, Dr. Sc.
Combined electricity and heat generation (cogeneration) is among the most technologically
clear, industrially mastered and commercially efficient ways of cutting down the consumption
of fossil fuels and of reducing the environmental impact involved. The experience available in
Russia in this field is reviewed.
Fossil fuels are and will long be the major source of satisfying the energy demands of
mankind. All responsible governments and the energy companies throughout the world share
the concern for an efficient use of fossil fuels and for minimizing the negative environmental
impact. We, in Russia, also share this concern and try to do our best in this area. In view of
increasing thermal efficiency of the fossil-fired power stations, natural gas is used in
combined cycles, while coal is burnt in supercritical steam units, along with the in-furnace
suppression of harmful emissions and implementation of flue gas cleaning. Also, measures
are underway in energy conservation carried out by industrial and municipal consumers, and
the electrified intercity and railway transport are in a wide use.
The power industry of Russia features a large-scale application of cogeneration power station
and centralized heat supply systems.
Russia is a cold climate country. Heat generation in it requires almost half (46%) of the total
fuel consumed. The Russian fuel balance and major heat consumers are illustrated in Tables 1
and 2 (Fig. 1 and 2).

In the USSR, cogeneration-based centralized heat supply for municipal consumers dates back
to 1925 in S.Petersburg and to 1928 in Moscow for the delivery of steam to industrial
facilities and for residential heating.
The cogeneration-based centralized heat supply systems had found in the USSR a wide
commercial application before World War II.
Since 1950, much attention had been paid to increasing cogeneration plant efficiency. The
live steam parameters had been increased to 13 MPa and 560C. In 1957, the first 50 MW
steam turbine had been manufactured with industrial (1.3 MPa) and district heating (0.25
MPa) steam extractions. In 1962 followed the 100 MW steam turbine with two-stage district
heating (DH) water heating at extraction pressures of 0.05-0.2 and 0.06-0.25 MPa with a
special tube bundle in the condenser for DH water heating. In 1970 was fabricated the
supercritical pressure (24 MPa, 540C) 250 MW steam turbine with reheat of up to 540C.
The two latter turbines were designed for covering heating loads. In parallel, the capacity was
increased of the turbines with industrial steam extractions and such turbine of 135 MW was
manufactured in 1973.
Some data of combined electricity and heat generation as for the end of last year are shown in
Table 4 (Fig. 4).

The Russian cogeneration plants mostly employ steam turbines capable of passing the main
steam flow to the condenser and carry the nominal load in the condensing mode. The turbines
have several controlled steam extractions for heat supply. The extractions are designed at
various steam pressures mostly within the range of 1.3 to 0.1 MPa. The steam flow to the
extractions is controlled by the turnable diaphragms, which partially or fully close the nozzles
arranged behind them. The condensers of some turbines employ the dedicated tube bundle for
DH water heating. In this case, the turbine operates with a poor vacuum and no condenser
heat loss to the environment.
Higher live steam parameters, reheat and upgrading the cycle circuit and design of steam
turbines had really contributed to better thermal efficiency of cogeneration plants. However,
specific heat consumption on the cogeneration units remains by about 5.5% higher as
compared to condensing turbine installations with a similar cycle and steam parameters. The
difference is really larger if one takes into account the fact that cogeneration plants employ 13
MPa/560C non-reheat turbines, whereas supercritical parameters and reheat are applied on
condensing units.
There is no doubt that accounting for heat supply changes the situation. The important index
is the ratio of electric generation and heat produced from extracted steam. Apart from
applying higher steam parameters, the ratio could be increased by increasing annual loading
of turbine extractions and decreasing the temperature of the DH water returned to the
cogeneration plant.
The heating load during the year is not uniform (Fig.5). Therefore, it is of advantage to cover
the base part of heating load in the combined cycle. The hot-water boilers, installed both at
cogeneration plants and near the consumers, cover the peak loads. When such boilers are
used, the reasonable cogeneration coefficient equal to the ratio of the maximum heat load in
the combined cycle and that of the heating system as a whole can be reduced to 0.4-0.5, with
the turbine extraction utilization hours as high as to 4-4.5 thousand h/y.
The tap water heating is an important contributor to increasing turbine extraction loading.
Generally, the tap water heaters of the heat stations located near the group of consumers are
connected in series to the main heating system heaters located upstream. In these cases, the
DH water is cooled to 30-50C and as such is returned to the cogeneration plants. In Russia,
the tap water heating load constitutes about 15% of the maximum heat load.
Fig. 5. Heating load curve:
1  Load, MW(t); 2  Calendar time, hrs; 3  Ambient temperature, C; 4  Heat produced in the
combined cycle
Now, under the transition to market conditions, some problems appeared.
The electricity and heat generated at the cogeneration plant in the combined cycle are in some
cases more expensive: electricity in comparison to large condensing power stations, and heat as compared to the consumer boiler plants firing natural gas. This is due to a domestic low
cost of the natural gas and inadequate pricing. Even if the heat is supplied from the
cogeneration plant located in the same place as the consumer, the heat price includes the
whole utility expenses along with the value-added tax, etc. Such cases do not mean combined
electricity and heat generation to be unprofitable. The technology saves annually 15 mln t in
oil equivalent (>600 1015 J/y). Heat sales ensure of up to 30% of utility income. Cogeneration
is an energy and resource saving and synergetic technology considerably reducing
environment impact.
Naturally, the technologies used in the cogeneration and centralized heat supply systems
developed 40-50 years ago could be upgraded considerably.
In applying gas turbine or combined-cycle installations at the cogeneration plants, the
electrical efficiency and specific electric generation in the combined mode can be increased
significantly. The gas-turbine technologies allow for the extending economically feasible
capacity range for combined electricity and heat generation. For example, the gas turbines can
be used in the reconstruction of the base load boiler plants (including those of small and
medium capacity) to convert them into efficient cogeneration plants.
The northern and eastern vast areas in Russia are of low-population density and are not
embraced by the electric and gas networks. In this case, small cogeneration plants can be
attractive for settlements and small towns located there. The required steam boilers and
turbines of 0.3-6 MW capacity are now available. The plants can operate on local wood fuel
or peat with minimum environmental impact.
Improved energy management, profitable partnership of the electricity and heat suppliers
municipalities and gas suppliers, as well as the governmental support (regulation) and
adequate legislation could add much to increasing commercial efficiency of cogeneration and
centralized heat supply.
With this in view, cogeneration seems to be strategically reasonable for the long-term period
and the available experience in the field deserves thorough study and distribution.

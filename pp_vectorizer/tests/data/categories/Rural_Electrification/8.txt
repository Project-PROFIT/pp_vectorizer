|Description   |In rural areas, the "Luz no Campo" national rural |
|              |electrification programme set as its goal for its |
|              |first stage (to 2002) to provide electrical power |
|              |to one million rural homes, which would benefit   |
|              |approximately five million people. This translates|
|              |into a demand for resources worth 2.7 million     |
|              |reales. In 2000, contracts with over 40           |
|              |concessionaires were signed.                      |
|              |                                                  |
|              |Meaning Light in the Countryside' the project was |
|              |launched in December 1999, by the federal         |
|              |government address to the stagnation in rural     |
|              |electrification after the restructuring of the    |
|              |power sector. Aimed at connecting nearly a million|
|              |rural households in the three-year period from    |
|              |1999-2002, Luz no Campo is the single largest     |
|              |rural electrification programme implemented in    |
|              |Brazil. Initial estimates forecasted an investment|
|              |of around 1 billion dollars, that is nearly 1000  |
|              |dollars per new consumer.                         |
|              |                                                  |
|              |As of September 2002, 480000 connections had been |
|              |made, and another 125000 were in process. A total |
|              |of 823000 new customers have signed contracts. So |
|              |far, no off-grid connections have been made under |
|              |the programme, even though this option was        |
|              |considered. This can partly be attributed to the  |
|              |relatively low cost of grid connections, averaging|
|              |970 dollars per connection.                       |
|              |                                                  |
|              |Rural consumers are typically expected to pay the |
|              |full costs of the connection, albeit spread over a|
|              |number of years. Luz-no-Campo lends 75% of the    |
|              |investment to concessionaires on easy terms a 6% |
|              |rate of interest, two-year grace period, and a    |
|              |five to ten year repayment period. Concessionaires|
|              |finance rural consumers on similar terms, but in  |
|              |some cases the State governments provide partial  |
|              |subsidies, assuming the consumer's contribution.  |
|              |                                                  |
|              |The blank in the programme is the lack of         |
|              |incentive to make low-cost grid connections or    |
|              |take on off-grid projects, except for a couple of |
|              |specific cases in Minas Gerais, Bahia, and        |
|              |Amazonas.                                         |

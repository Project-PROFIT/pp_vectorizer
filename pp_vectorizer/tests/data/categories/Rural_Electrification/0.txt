1. Background of Project
In 1995, the Government of Ghana published their
National Development Policy Framework called "Vision
2020". As part of it, the Government formulated the
National Electrification Scheme aiming to provide
electricity across the nation by 2020.
Asesewa and Yeji areas had been contributing largely
to the economic development of Ghana, since both are
important areas for food production and agriculture,
including inland fisheries in Yeji. These areas, however,
had always been without electricity. As Asesewa and Yeji
are some distance away from the electrified district
capital, it was expensive to connect these areas to the
national electricity grid.
The Government of Ghana requested grant aid from
Japan for the electrification of Asesewa and Yeji areas.
The Government of Japan assisted the electrification of
the Assewa area in the first phase of the Project, and that
of the Yeji area in the second phase.
This evaluation deals with the second phase, the
electrification of Yeji area.
2. Project Overview

system for transmission line facilities is
established.

4. Period of Evaluation
8 November 1999-15 December 1999
5. Results of Evaluation
(1) Efficiency
(4) Narrative Summary
The construction of facilities, including 86.1km of

33kV line and 95 km of low voltage network and
substations, was completed as planned. Overall project
implementation was highly efficient.
(2) Effectiveness
The project purpose was achieved, as the nine
targeted villages had been connected to the national
electricity grid. However, due to the shortage of electric
meters procured by the Ghanaian side, only 20 percent of
interviewed households were actually supplied with
electricity. The remaining 60 percent were waiting to be
connected to distribution lines, which accompanies the
installation of meters.

(3) Impact
Residents supplied with electricity were able to enjoy
an improved standard of living. For example, safety in the
area was increased by the spread of night-lighting, and
access to information was improved by listening to the
radio for longer periods of time. Food preservation and
housework also became more convenient. Regarding
business activities, the interviewed business people
answered that the supply of electricity had revitalized
business activities in the area: 35 percent had extended
their business hours by about 1.5 hours; 40 percent
improved their facilities by introducing electricallyoperated appliances; and 60 percent were planning to
extend their business operations. It is still too early to
evaluate the project impact on employment, but the
number of people who were engaged in economic
activities using electricity had increased, especially in the
area of agricultural product processing, retail sales and
small supermarkets.

enhanced which in turn increased user-ability to pay. On
the other hand, the fact that many users are still poor and
may not be in a position to pay electric bills promptly may
inhibit sustainability.
(4) Relevance
The purpose and activities of the project were highly
relevant to the needs and policies of Ghana. The project
was consistent with the Government of Ghana's National
Development Policy ("Vision 2020") aiming to supply
electricity to all, and contributed to the improvement of
standards of living of the people. At the same time, the
Project met the development assistance policies of Japan,
which target especially underdeveloped areas in the
partner countries. The project promotes good relations
between Ghana and Japan.
(5) Sustainability
Since power industries are maintained and operated
by user fees, the supply of electricity aided financial
sustainability in that industries and incomes were

While America has traditionally championed privatization and market
liberalization as the all encompassing answer to development issues
including rural electrification, it is interesting to compare how America's
rural inhabitants came to have electricity.
Contrary to the acclaim of the free market, rural electrification in
America happened as a result of social programs implemented upon the
passage of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Prior to the act,
approximately 10% of America's rural dwellers had electricity in comparison
to 90% of the urban population. Private utility companies argued that it
would be too costly to extend the grid for such a low density of demand.
In response to this unmet need, the Roosevelt Administration created the
Rural Electrification Administration (REA) in 1935. The REA made millions
of dollars in loans available for public, private, and cooperative utility
adventures. Rural cooperatives emerged as the key borrowers of REA funds,
which were private partnerships owned and controlled by the they served.
The role of rural cooperatives allowed households with a high demand access
to electricity even when private utilities denied them. The REA caused
controversy among those who felt the government was unfairly competing with
private utilities. Some argued that the public provision of electric power
was a step closer to socialism (which it essentially was), which led to
judicial hearings. Ironically, the REA did little to impede private
utilities - it actually helped electric companies by providing credit for
grid extension and increasing the customer base of the utility companies.
The arrangement proved to be successful- rural households with electricity
shot up to 25% in just four years. In fact, some countries today have used
the REA as a model for their own rural electrification programs.

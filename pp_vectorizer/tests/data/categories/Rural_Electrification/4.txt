ABSTRACT
This paper  presents  recommendations  on  public  policy  concerning  rural
electrification in South Africa, which have been developed during  a  three-
year research project The role of electricity in the  integrated  provision
of energy to rural areas. Matters that  are  dealt  with  include  national
electrification  priorities,  means  of  enhancing  the  benefits  of  rural
electrification, and the financing of rural electrification.
1. INTRODUCTION
The research project The role of electricity in  the  integrated  provision
of  energy  to  rural  areas  aimed  to  develop   policy   proposals   and
implementation guidelines for rural electrification  (using  grid  and  non-
grid technologies) in South Africa. It was jointly funded by the  Department
of Minerals and Energy (DME), Eskoms Technology Research  &  Investigations
(TRI), and the Norwegian Agency for  International  Development  Cooperation
(NORAD). The Development Bank  of  Southern  Africa  (DBSA)  also  supported
specific aspects of the work.
The purpose of this paper  is  to  present  the  recommendations  from  this
research project with respect to public policy on rural electrification.  As
such it is based on a final paper written for  the  project,  namely  Rural
electrification policy: some key recommendations [1], which  in  turn  drew
on a large number of reports prepared for the  project.  It  is  hoped  that
that this paper, and the research project as a  whole,  will  contribute  to
current debates on electrification policy in South Africa.
1. DEFINITION OF RURAL AREAS
Current definitions of urban and rural areas in South  Africa  are  both
inadequate and inconsistent. The working definition of  rural  areas  used
in  this  paper  is  based  on  the   DBSAs   definition   of   functional
urbanisation [2], which is an improvement on the  official  definition.  It
includes all areas other than towns and cities which had some form of  local
authority under the Apartheid system, as well as  the  informal  settlements
bordering on such towns and cities. This still  means,  however,  that  most
areas in the former homelands are classified as rural areas,  irrespective
of the size or  density  of  the  settlements,  in  addition  to  commercial
farming areas outside of the homelands.
2. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
The findings of the project generally support the view, broadly held in  the
electricity sector, that the government, and particularly the DME, needs  to
take overall responsibility for the national electrification programme,  and
provide a policy framework within which  utilities  and  other  players  can
operate. More specific policy recommendations are outlined in the  following
sections.
 1. NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PRIO-RITIES
The  national  electrification  programme  currently   targets   households,
clinics and  schools.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  the  potential  role  of
electricity in various  sectors    including  health,  education,  domestic
water supply, small-scale agriculture and small-business  development    in
rural areas, it is recommended  that  community  water  supply  schemes  and
small-scale agricultural projects should be included  among  the  priorities
of the programme. In both cases electrification can make a  contribution  to
the development  of  the  sector  in  the  immediate  future.  For  example,
according to Tapson [3] many small-scale agricultural projects  exist  where
the  prerequisites  for   electrification   to   impact   significantly   on
agricultural development are in place. There are cases where electricity  is
the main outstanding requirement for  larger-scale  irrigation  projects  to
proceed.
 2. LONG-TERM APPROACH TO RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
The research has shown that household electrification has  important  direct
(practical) and symbolic value to rural  people,  and  that  electrification
can make an  important  contribution  to  rural  development  by  supporting
service provision and local economic development.  It  is  therefore  highly
desirable that all people and communities in South Africa be  provided  with
electricity at some stage so that they can share in its benefits.  In  fact,
Crawford Cousins [4] argues  that  poor  rural  people  have  a  social  and
economic right to a prepayment electricity supply at a nominal energy  cost,
which would give them access to electric light and media at least.  Many  of
the benefits of electricity will probably be realised in  rural  areas  only
in the longer term (possibly after ten years), however, as  the  constraints
experienced at present  are  overcome.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that
electrification   policy   should   take   a   long-term   view   of   rural
electrification,  and  should  provide   for   the   continuation   of   the
electrification of rural areas at a  steady  pace  at  least  for  the  next
twenty years, or until all people and communities have  been  provided  with
an affordable, adequate and reliable form of electricity.
 3. ENHANCING THE BENEFITS OF RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
The research has shown that electricity can make an  important  contribution
to rural development.  What  it  has  not  done  is  to  provide  conclusive
evidence that rural electrification is  justifiable  on  the  basis  of  its
contribution to rural  development.  It  can  be  argued  that  this  is  an
impossible task, however, seeing that it is not possible  to  quantify  many
of the important impacts which are indicated by the research findings.
Another important reason, however, is the  fact  that  it  was  consistently
found that the potential benefits of electricity are not being  realised  in
rural areas. This was found in  all  the  sectors  that  were  investigated,
including the household sector. This is a crucial  finding  to  emerge  from
this research project. It has further been found that, while poverty  is  an
obstacle to realising the full benefits of electricity, there are many  ways
in which the impact of electricity on the  lives  of  rural  people  can  be
enhanced even under current conditions. This resulted in a strong  focus  in
the research project on  strategies  to  ensure  that  electricity  benefits
rural people as much as possible, the details of which cannot  be  discussed
here. The policy recommendations that have been  developed  in  this  regard
are the following:
  Many changes that seem reasonable to expect  as  a  result  of  household
   electrification, such as the replacement of candles  and  paraffin  lamps
   with electric light, and the use  of  electricity  rather  than  dry-cell
   batteries  to  power  radios,  are  occurring  to   some   degree   only.
   Electrification policy needs to ensure that, at the very least, the  most
   basic benefits of access to electricity - the use  of  electric  lighting
   and radios - are realised in as many electrified households as possible.
  An important finding of this research project is that,  contrary  to  the
   general perception, many poor rural  households  do  regard  the  use  of
   electricity  for  cooking  purposes  as  very  important  (one  of  their
   priorities), even if cooking is not done  exclusively  with  electricity.
   Electrification policy needs to facilitate as far as possible the use  of
   electricity for cooking purposes by poor households who desire this.
  Initiatives to address the problems of rural households with the  use  of
   fuels such as fuelwood, paraffin and LPG for  thermal  purposes,  and  to
   reduce  the  consumption  of  fuels  while  achieving  the  same  cooking
   objectives, should be given much greater attention in energy policy  than
   is the case  at  present.  The  newly  established  Demand  and  Non-Grid
   Electrification Directorate in the DME could be  encouraged  to  take  up
   integrated energy planning and provision [5].
  Broad guidelines regarding appropriate  electricity  supply  options  and
   tariffs should  be  included  in  electrification  policy  to  guide  the
   development of supply/tariff options by utilities.  For  example,  supply
   options with varying capacity need  to  be  provided  to  all  households
   electrified with the grid, including the poor; different levels of supply
   should be accompanied by different tariffs and connection fees, of  which
   at least some need to be affordable to poor households; and monthly flat-
   rate payments by the rural poor should be avoided [6].
  Guidelines to provide for improved community participation  practices  in
   electrification projects should be included in electrification  policy  
   for  example,  that  current  community  education   and   consultation
   practices and processes should be replaced with participatory  approaches
   [7].
  The possibility of using funds from sources outside  of  the  electricity
   sector  -  for  example,  donor  and  government  funding  for  community
   development  and  empowerment    to  support   participatory   community
   processes during electrification projects should be investigated.
 4. INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN SECTORS
A key issue which has emerged from this work is the  importance  of  greater
coordination and/or integration of the rural electrification programme  with
programmes to provide water, health and education services, and  to  develop
small-scale  agriculture  and  small  businesses,  if  the  contribution  of
electricity to these sectors is to  be  more  significant.  Inadequacies  in
current  arrangements  for  coordination   and   integration   between   the
electricity sector and the other  sectors  have  been  identified,  and  the
following preliminary recommendations have been made on  how  the  situation
can be improved:
  The national Department of  Health  needs  to  establish  a  policy  that
   clearly sets out the role of electrification in improving health in rural
   areas. This will better equip the department to drive and take  ownership
   of the current clinic building and electrification programmes [8].
  The national and provincial Departments of Education should  play  a  key
   role in formulating policy on the role of electricity in  supporting  key
   education  priorities.  Furthermore,  a  range  of  directorates  in  the
   provincial Departments  of  Education  need  to  provide  inputs  to  the
   planning of electrification services at schools [9].
  Both the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF)  and  Eskom  (or
   new utilities established in the future) should  seek  opportunities  for
   greater cooperation on  domestic  water  supply  projects.  For  example,
   opportunities exist for sharing the costs  of  grid  extension  to  rural
   communities, and for replacing diesel pumps with electrical pumps [10].
  Small-scale agricultural schemes involving collectives of  small  growers
   need to be given more attention by Eskom (or new utilities established in
   the future), and be included in  overall  electrification  planning.  For
   example, minor re-routing of Eskom lines could make it possible to  bring
   into  production  areas  of  high  agricultural   potential.   Provincial
   Departments of Agriculture need to pro-actively seek the collaboration of
   Eskom at a strategic planning level to ensure  that  these  opportunities
   and others are not missed [3].
  A much greater  degree  of  coordination  and  cooperation  is  necessary
   between Eskom (or new  utilities  established  in  the  future)  and  the
   institutions responsible for the development of  the  small,  medium  and
   micro-enterprises  (SMME)  sector  in  general    for  example,   Ntsika
   Enterprise Promotion Agency [11].
It  is  further  recommended  that  the  government  department  or   agency
responsible  for  development  in  a  particular  sector  and  the   utility
responsible for electrification should establish a  joint  policy  regarding
cooperation between their regional staff, and encourage  its  implementation
[10].   The   responsible   departments   should   pro-actively   seek   the
collaboration of the utilities at the level  of  strategic  planning    for
example, the utility could identify a  key  planning  staff  member  who  is
delegated to attend  all  development  planning  meetings  of  a  particular
department as  a  formal  committee  member  [3].  Simple  steps  should  be
introduced into the routines of regional or sub-regional planning  staff  in
the responsible departments, agencies and utilities    for  example,  half-
yearly meetings which could involve each service provider  presenting  their
plans for the next year to each other; and regular semi-formal  meetings  on
specific local plans and projects [10].
The DME could  play  an  important  role  in  encouraging  and  facilitating
cooperation of this nature  in the first place, by stating clearly  in  the
national electrification policy that the contribution of electrification  to
development in all relevant sectors is valued and will be supported; in  the
second place, by commissioning research on the reasons for  failed  attempts
at cooperation between institutions in the past, as well as the reasons  for
isolated successes; and thirdly, by raising  the  matter  and  disseminating
relevant  information  at  meetings  with  the  different  departments   and
agencies/utilities.
 5. MIX OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY OPTIONS
The  research  has   confirmed,   as   is   widely   accepted,   that   grid
electrification in rural areas is not financially viable and that  extensive
subsidies are required to cover losses. One study by Davis  [12]  quantified
the costs and the extent of subsidies as follows (assuming  that  access  to
electricity outside the main urban areas reached 50% by the  year  2000  and
67% by 2010):
  Average capital costs were found  to  be  R4740  (1995  rand  value)  per
   connection, with a clear trend towards  higher  costs  as  the  programme
   progressed. If capacity differentiated supplies were  not  used,  capital
   costs increased, on average, by 30%.
  The net present value (NPV) of the programme was highly negative at minus
   R13.8 billion, which was equivalent to minus R3500 per connection.
   If  all  financing  requirements  were  met  through  debt,  the   total
   accumulated debt in 2011 would be R38 billion, equivalent  to  R9500  per
   connection.  This debt would be more than  three  times  the  depreciated
   value of assets at this time.
  An average subsidy of 17c/kWh,  or  R32  per  customer  per  month  would
   suffice to keep debt within acceptable levels. If no debt was allowed  at
   the end of the programme, much higher subsidies were required  -  in  the
   order of R1.2 billion per annum.
The study further showed that it is capital  costs,  rather  than  operating
losses, which drive the financial impact of  the  programme.  This  suggests
that major cost saving gains are to be made in  considering  innovations  in
supply technologies rather than in operating procedures.
Van Horen  and  Thompson  [13]  analysed  a  number  of  scenarios  for  the
electrification of all homes that are currently  not  electrified  within  a
twenty-year period. A range of grid supply options and two  sizes  of  solar
home systems (SHS) were included in the analysis. Their  analysis  indicates
that a programme using only grid connections of 20A and higher would have  a
net present value of R 9.1 billion (1997 rand value) more negative than  one
using a mix of technologies.
Their analysis of the non-grid component of the programme as  a  stand-alone
operation suggests that it is not financially viable at  the  tariff  levels
used in the study (set at a similar level to 2.5A grid  connections    that
is, monthly tariffs of R15 and
R20 respectively). Subsidies would therefore be required to sustain  a  non-
grid electrification programme. In  order  to  ensure  the  viability  of  a
dedicated non-grid utility, revenues would have to be of the  order  of  R36
and R48 per system per month to cover the costs of delivery and  maintenance
of small and large solar  systems  respectively,  in  addition  to  a  R1500
capital subsidy per system. Van Horen and Thompson  [13]  argue  that  these
subsidy requirements, while large in  relation  to  the  non-grid  programme
itself, are modest in relation to the grid programme. They conclude  that  a
non-grid  programme  will  result  in  smaller  losses  being  incurred   by
utilities in many rural areas, and therefore  carries  a  lower  opportunity
cost than grid electrification.
These findings indicate that a mix of electricity supply  options  needs  to
be a key feature of the rural electrification programme.
Banks  nevertheless  argues  that,  while  financial  studies  on  household
electrification lead one to conclude that SHS should be used  in  the  South
African programme,  the  picture  is  more  complex  when  viewed  from  the
perspective of communities. Photovoltaic (PV) systems  deliver  a  far  more
restricted level of service to households and communities, and may  well  be
more expensive (from the householders perspective) than  grid  electricity.
Non-grid electrification is thus only likely to be accepted  by  communities
if it is very clear that grid electrification is  simply  not  available  to
them. He points out that, as in the case of the  schools  and  clinics  non-
grid electrification programmes, there is a real risk that two  vital  areas
may be inadequately addressed in a SHS programme: customer  acceptance,  and
longer term maintenance [14].
 6. SUBSIDISATION OF SOLAR HOME SYSTEMS
Different approaches and strategies are being and will be employed in  pilot
projects to disseminate SHS in South  Africa,  including  loan  schemes  and
payment-for-service options.  These  have  different  implications  for  the
costs to the consumer, as well as the share of  risk  between  the  supplier
and consumer. For a given subsidy level, the latter seems to  offer  greater
potential for reaching the poor, as it involves a lower initial monthly  fee
and lower  risk  than  loan  schemes  [14].  Payment-for-service  approaches
further seem to offer the best  prospect  of  ensuring  that  resources  are
available for system maintenance, although  the  counter  argument  is  that
they reduce the users incentive to manage the system properly.
Both of these approaches need to be given a fair chance,  and  be  carefully
evaluated to assess, among other things, to what extent they are  successful
in reaching the poor. The findings  will  have  important  implications  for
policy on the subsidisation of SHS.
Banks [14] points out that the affordability of SHS to the poor  depends  on
two factors: In the first place, it depends on the installation cost of  the
PV systems, which can possibly be reduced by a  capital  subsidy.  Secondly,
and even more importantly, affordability depends  on  the  extent  to  which
households will be able to continue to keep the systems operational.  Either
the users must be wealthy enough to do this, or the operational  costs  will
also have to be subsidised, with attendant implications for both  the  scale
and sustainability of any subsidy offered. For example,  even  with  capital
subsidies of the order of R1500, the  installation  costs  of  SHS  and  the
required replacement of the battery every few years  are  likely  to  render
the technology beyond the reach of the poorer 50% of households.
In  light  of   this   assessment,   Banks   [14]   argues   that   non-grid
electrification should possibly be approached as an elegant way  of  meeting
the high-quality energy needs of households who do not have access  to  grid
electricity, but can afford PV systems in the absence of subsidies. Even  if
the poorer members of communities have insufficient resources to  prioritise
or afford non-grid systems, the less poor people that  could  afford  them
constitute a very significant potential market. A programme  aimed  at  this
market would focus on removing constraints such as the lack of finance,  the
lack of awareness  and  information,  and  the  uncertainty  regarding  grid
plans.
If subsidies are introduced, on the other hand, the  question  of  equitable
distribution of resources raises its head, seeing that  the  subsidy  levels
being considered are unlikely to render the purchase  and  operation  of  PV
systems affordable  to  the  poorest  members  of  communities.  Unless  due
attention is paid to this - perhaps by allocating resources to  meeting  the
cooking  energy  requirements  of  the   poorest   households   -   non-grid
electrification will be yet another development arena in which  the  poorest
are further marginalised [14].
The  introduction  of  capital  subsidies  for  SHS  should   therefore   be
approached with great caution.
7. INTEGRATED PLANNING OF NON-GRID ELECTRIFICATION
The research has indicated that non-grid supply options, and PV  systems  in
particular,  has  the  potential  to   contribute   significantly   to   the
improvement of health, education and water supply services in  rural  areas,
while it also has a potentially important role to play  in  providing  power
to small informal agricultural projects in rural  areas.  For  example,  the
latter typically involves vegetable gardens,  small-scale  pig  and  poultry
enterprises, and water pumping for cattle watering.  The  power  consumption
of such projects, whether for pumping, cooling or heating, is  usually  less
than 1kW. This, as well as other characteristics  of  these  projects  make
them good candidates for solar power [3].
In addition, an important finding has emerged from research  on  the  clinic
and schools non-grid electrification programmes implemented in  the  Eastern
Cape [15]: In the interests of greater  equity  between  grid  and  non-grid
areas, considerable effort needs to be made  to  develop  new  services  and
improve existing services other than schools and clinics in areas not to  be
electrified with the grid. This could involve  the  provision  of  PV  water
pumping systems, and the PV electrification of a range of public  buildings.
Household PV electrification has been  identified  as  a  high  priority  by
people under these circumstances.
These  matters  cannot,  however,  be  addressed  by  a  specific   sectoral
programme. Rather, national electrification  policy  needs  to  provide  the
framework for such an approach to non-grid electrification [15].
8. FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF REDS
With regard to the restructuring of the  electricity  distribution  industry
in South Africa, an important concern from the perspective of a  rural  grid
electrification  programme  is  the  financial  viability  of  the  regional
electricity  distributors  (REDs)  that  will  be  responsible   for   rural
electrification. In the light of current fiscal policies  in  South  Africa,
and the extreme pressures on the fiscus,  it  seems  particularly  important
that rural electrification be  undertaken  by  distributors  which  will  be
financially healthy and able to  undertake  electrification  well  into  the
future.
From this perspective the boundaries of the REDs as proposed  by  ERIC  [16]
are of considerable concern, as the  two  unviable  REDs  (the  Central  and
Northern REDs) include most of the poorest and most  populated  rural  areas
in South Africa  that is, the  Eastern  Cape,  Northern  Province  and  the
North West, with the exception  only  of  KwaZulu/Natal  [13].  This  matter
should  therefore  be  considered  when  the  RED  boundaries  are   finally
established.
 9. CAPITAL SUBSIDIES FOR ELECTRI-FICATION
Another matter of great importance to  the  grid  electrification  of  rural
areas concerns capital subsidies  for  rural  electrification.  The  average
cost per connection varies considerably between the provinces. For  example,
in 1995 the average connection cost (including urban and rural  connections)
was lowest  in  the  Western  Cape  (R1500)  and  highest  in  KwaZulu-Natal
(R3900). In 1996, on the other hand, Mpumalanga and Gauteng had  the  lowest
cost per connection (R2600), and the Northern  Cape  and  KwaZulu-Natal  the
highest (R3700) [17].
Furthermore, KwaZulu-Natal had the highest cost per  connection  in  rural
areas in 1995 (R5055), and Free State in 1996 (R5859).  The  high  costs  in
KwaZulu-Natal can be attributed mainly to the scattered settlement  patterns
in the African traditional areas,  as  well  as  the  topography,  which  is
characterised by deep ravines. In the Free State it is attributed mainly  to
the need for network expansion to electrify  black  residential  areas  of
small towns (Boshoff  in  Thom  [18]).  The  cost  is  further  expected  to
increase considerably in the  Eastern  Cape  as  the  electrification  drive
starts to focus more on the former Transkei, which  has  a  limited  network
compared to other populous areas. The undeveloped nature of the  network  in
this area is attributed to the fact that, unlike most of  the  other  former
homelands, the Transkei mainly comprised one large consolidated area.  As  a
result, it has not greatly benefited from the building of electricity  lines
to commercial farms in the 1970s and 1980s. In the  Northern  Cape  the  low
average population density  and  long  distances  between  settlements  also
result in relatively high costs. The reasons  for  varying  grid  connection
costs are therefore mainly historical (particularly the racial  policies  in
the past) and geographic in nature.
If the same capital subsidy per connection were provided  to  all  provinces
or regions, this would further entrench  the  current  inequalities  between
provinces and regions. This situation will be  exacerbated  further  if  the
distributors  mainly  responsible  for   rural   electrification   are   not
financially  healthy.  While  there  is  a  place  for  non-grid   household
electrification, as well as a need to provide incentives to distributors  to
reduce the cost of grid technology, there is  also  a  need  to  enable  the
advancement of the grid in all provinces and regions, also in  rural  areas.
Capital  subsidies  should  therefore  be  applied  differentially  in   the
different provinces or regions. However, a maximum  could  be  set  for  the
capital subsidy per connection.
3. CONCLUSION
It has been argued above that electrification policy  should  take  a  long-
term view of rural electrification, and should provide for the  continuation
of the electrification of rural areas at a steady  pace  at  least  for  the
next twenty years, or until all people and communities  have  been  provided
with an affordable, adequate and reliable form of electricity.
The analysis by Van Horen and Thompson [13]  indicates  that  the  necessary
financial resources to achieve full electrification after 20 years  using  a
mix of technologies  can  be  raised  within  the  electricity  distribution
industry as a whole  for example, by raising tariffs by  5-10%  across  the
board. The crucial policy question which needs to be addressed is  thus  not
whether it is financially possible to electrify all areas  in  the  next  20
years or so, but whether achieving full rural electrification within such  a
period is a national priority, both from a political perspective,  and  from
a development perspective.
Government  seems  ready  to  address  the  fact  that  the  electrification
programme has been receiving a huge slice of public resources without  being
subject to the  fiscal  restrictions  faced  by  other  crucial  development
sectors, such as domestic water supply. This is reflected by the  fact  that
Eskom (and utilities such as REDs that will be established  in  the  future)
was recently made subject  to  the  payment  of  corporate  income  tax  and
dividends to the state. It is also evident in the growing  support  for  the
financing of  electrification  from  the  fiscus  rather  than  a  dedicated
Electrification Fund.
Subjecting  the  electrification  programme  to  a  national  prioritisation
process  seems  appropriate  in  light  of  the  extremely  limited   public
resources  available  for  development  in  the  country.  Nevertheless,  it
remains necessary to extend the grid, and electricity generally, to as  many
people as possible within the constraints of the  public  funding  available
for electrification.

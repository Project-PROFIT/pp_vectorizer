2003 Description The Rural Electrification Plan (Planes de Electrificacin
Rural) seeks to incorporate renewable sources, where economically viable,
into extended distribution lines. The first Rural Electrification Plan ran
from 1993 to 2002 and increased national coverage of electricity services
from 57% to 75%. The second and current plan aims to increase national
coverage of electricity services to 91%.
The Rural Electrification Plan funds projects relating to transmission
lines, small electricity systems and small hydroelectric plants to reach
its goal. The general framework for Perus rural electrification policy
falls under Law no. 27744, the Ley de Electrificacin Rural y de Zona
Aisladas y de Fronter (Rural and Isolated and Border Areas Electrification
Act), which was enacted in May 2002.
The Rural Electrification Plan is funded through the Rural Electrification
Fund (Fondo de Electrificacin Rural, or FER). The Fund is funded primarily
through three sources: - it obtains 2% of profits from electricity
generation, transmission and distribution companies; up to 25% of the
proceeds from private electricity companies; and transfers from the Public
Treasury and from local and regional governments. The FER is a rotating
fund, with the Direccin Ejecutiva de Proyectos (Project Implementation
Department) of the Ministry of Energy and Mines investing a minimum of
0.85% of the general budget to extending electricity services in Peru.
Rural electrification projects are chosen based on technical (current state
of the project, existing or planned electricity infrastructure, provincial
electrification ratio), economic (current net social value and per capita
investment level) and social factors (poverty index, geographical
location). Higher priority is given to projects located in regions where
electricity supply is most deficient. Policy type Capital Grants

      Barriers
      Unfortunately, for as clear and urgent of a problem as rural
      electrification is, there are numerous barriers that are preventing an
      explicit solution:
     Low income households inability to fund high costs
     Lack of marginal income
     Effective cost of energy is increased by additional cost of purchasing
      electric appliances
     Low income/rural areas have relatively low densities of energy demand
     Expanding networks to these areas is generally not viable without
      substantial subsidies
     Where no network exists, alternatives, such as mini-grids or
      generators, are costly
     Lack of education and training for energy technologies
     Flexible, small scale financing and/or credit options aren't readily
      available
     Lack of uniformity prevents facile solutions

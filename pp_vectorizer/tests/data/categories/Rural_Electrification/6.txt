|Best Practices                                                |
|Financing                                                     |
|The cases of Chile, America, Kenya, and Kiribati demonstrate  |
|the importance of access to low-cost credit with flexible     |
|options for rural households. There are numerous ways in which|
|this can occur- through the government, local creditors,      |
|foreign lenders, or through international organizations such  |
|as the World Bank. One design that has been effective in the  |
|rural setting is establishing a local member supported bank   |
|that makes small loans. The case of Kenya exemplifies how hire|
|and purchase agencies that naturally emerged as a result of   |
|the PV market allowed households that had been previously     |
|excluded entry into the market. Even though many households   |
|are willing to spend a significant portion of their income on |
|electricity, the high capital costs eliminate the possibility |
|of electrification for many households. Credit can act as the |
|bridge over the financial gap that hinders the lowest income  |
|sector.                                                       |
|Grassroots initiatives                                        |
|The definitive buzzword but nonetheless true- planning from   |
|the grassroots level is essential for sustainability.         |
|Outsiders cannot know what will work best for a community. In |
|the case of Kiribati, too much emphasis was placed on the     |
|dissemination of photovoltaic systems- how people would react |
|to them seemed to be a secondary concern. Even with what      |
|seemed to be a flawless plan, photovoltaic systems sales      |
|floundered because the people didn't accept them. This problem|
|was resolved when sales posts turned their focus from pushing |
|sales to maintenance, leading to higher levels of customer    |
|satisfaction. Planning from the bottom up will more accurately|
|reflect peoples needs. It also encourages consumer            |
|participation, which is crucial for sustainability. When a    |
|community plays an active role in an electrification project, |
|the objective will remain in touch with what the people need  |
|and the best way to incorporate it into their lives. As       |
|demonstrated with the case of rural Mali, generators are only |
|provided to villages that form an organization to finance and |
|manage the endeavor, ensuring ownership and accountability.   |
|The ultimate assessment of any rural electrification project  |
|must be: how did this affect the peoples' lives? Grassroots   |
|initiatives makes certain that this answer is as positive as  |
|possible.                                                     |
|Appropriate Technology                                        |
|Energy can come from numerous possible energy sources- grid   |
|extension, electric generators, and various forms of renewable|
|energy. If economics weren't an issue, the ideal solution     |
|would be to connect all the 2 billion without access to an    |
|electric grid using renewable energy resources to generate the|
|additional power needed, thereby at least partially leveling  |
|out the playing field for the underprivileged. Of course,     |
|economics is the issue, so choosing the appropriate technology|
|for electrification requires being "technologically neutral"  |
|and choosing the least cost option.                           |
|Grid Extension                                                |
|In the cases where grid extension is a viable option for a    |
|village, it is usually the best method due to additional      |
|benefits it provides in the community for those who can't     |
|afford electricity such as public lighting and refrigeration. |
|However, grid extension can be costly for far distances. When |
|distance or other circumstances make an off-grid technology   |
|comparatively less expensive, options include electric        |
|generators or renewable resources.                            |
|Generators                                                    |
|Generators are the traditional alternative to a grid extension|
|for populations in need of an off-grid energy source. They can|
|provide energy for lighting, cooking, water pumps, as well as |
|grinding machines, a virtual lifesaver for some women, as the |
|case of the Multi-Functional Platform machines in Mali        |
|demonstrates. Although more efficient than traditional forms  |
|of energy such as burning wood or charcoal, generators        |
|constantly require gas to run, which can be costly and present|
|problems. In some cases, this cost is enough to make a diesel |
|generator an unsustainable energy source. For Terese in       |
|Ethiouar, although her village had a diesel machine, it was   |
|not used due to the high operation costs of fuel. However,    |
|under the right circumstances and the appropriate             |
|dissemination and implementation programs such as the         |
|multifunctional platform project in rural Mali, diesel        |
|generators can have field success and are considered to be a  |
|viable option for decentralized electricity.                  |
|Renewable Energies                                            |
|Renewable energies such as hydropower, solar, wind, and       |
|biomass offer the benefit of decentralization that generators |
|offer without the high operational costs, dependence on gas,  |
|and pollution. Successful projects have most notably involved |
|wind turbines, which generate electricity from wind, and      |
|particularly photovoltaic systems, which generate electricity |
|from sunlight. As the case studies of Kenya and Kiribati      |
|demonstrate, photovoltaic systems have become a viable source |
|of off grid electricity.                                      |
|The problem that has kept photovoltaic systems (as well as    |
|other renewable energies) in a niche market is it's high      |
|capital cost: a home photovoltaic system costs around US$. The|
|problem is exacerbated by the shortage of affordable credit   |
|available to the rural population. Projects involving PV      |
|technology must almost always receive funding from            |
|international organizations, NGOs, or foreign governments.    |
|However, experts predict that vast improvements in efficiency |
|and cost will occur once the technology undergoes the         |
|"learning curve", the exponential decrease of cost associated |
|with any new technology, due to the "learning-by-doing"       |
|phenomena and economies of scale11.                           |
|An exciting future funding possibility  CDM                  |
|A promising possibility for additional investment in renewable|
|energy for rural electrification could result from the        |
|ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty   |
|for reducing CO2 emissions. Under the treaty, the "annex"     |
|(rich) countries would be required to reduce their CO2        |
|emissions by varying quantities. A of the treaty allows for   |
|these countries to partially fulfill their abatement          |
|requirements by supporting carbon abating initiatives in      |
|"non-annex" (poor) countries, called the Clean Development    |
|Mechanism (CDM).                                              |
|This would greatly increase funding for renewable energy      |
|projects for those without access to the electricity grid. In |
|turn, economists argue that such an influx of funds would     |
|lower the cost for the rural population, which in turn would  |
|increase demand, leading to increased production levels,      |
|further reducing the cost. Unfortunately, the refusal of the  |
|Bush Administration to sign the Kyoto Protocol has prevented  |
|its ratification. To date, environmentalists, experts, and    |
|activists are still fighting for its passage.                 |
|                                                              |
|Social benefits of renewable energy resources such as not     |
|degrading the environment constitute a positive externality-  |
|they are not reflected in the market cost. Government policy  |
|should therefore try to correct this market failure with laws |
|that encourage investment in renewable technologies to develop|
|these markets. (For further reading on corrective policy for  |
|renewable energies, see policy options).                      |
|Appropriate Policy                                            |
|Financing is the trickiest barrier to rural electrification   |
|for the obvious reason that it is an expensive endeavor that  |
|it's intended consumers cannot afford the cost of the         |
|infrastructure and the service. Governments of developing     |
|countries have traditionally responded to this problem by     |
|funding electrification through public utility and subsidizing|
|service, however these policies have historically led to      |
|massive problems with corruption, inefficiency and lack of    |
|accountability. These subsidies often disproportionately      |
|benefit the wealthiest households and undermine any incentive |
|to improve services or extend the grid. The challenge facing  |
|sound policy is to devise a program that helps finance        |
|electrification but allows for market mechanisms to ensure    |
|efficiency and better allocate resources. Chile's policy is   |
|exemplary in that it granted one-time subsidies (on a         |
|competitive basis) and created market mechanisms whenever     |
|appropriate. The outstanding results of the program confirm   |
|the importance of good policy that corrects market failures   |
|yet doesn't oversubsidize electricity.                        |
|The Role of the International Community                       |
|Rural electrification requires multilateral support. Starting |
|from the rural sector, there must be a desire for electricity |
|and a community willing to support a project. The government's|
|job is to implement apropos policy, guiding the process and   |
|addressing any market failures. The participation of the      |
|international community is vital as lenders, introducers of   |
|technology, foreign aid, and perhaps most importantly, as a   |
|forum for knowledge sharing. The UNDP website for Energy and  |
|Environment states:                                           |
|"The UNDP helps countries strengthen their capacity to address|
|these challenges at global, national and community levels,    |
|seeking out and sharing best practices, providing innovative  |
|policy advice and linking partners through pilot projects that|
|help poor people build sustainable livelihoods."12            |
|We must be cautious in not overstepping our boundaries from   |
|providing aid to imposing on a countries political autonomy.  |
|Unfortunately, once there are profits to be made, the         |
|objectives of international aid can shift from apolitical     |
|benevolence to a business opportunity. The actions of these   |
|agencies reflect the ideology and the interests not of the    |
|poor countries they are supposedly helping but the rich       |
|countries who decide the agenda.                              |
|For example, The United States (as well as other overly       |
|developed countries) has zealously pushed the idea of         |
|"privatization" and "market liberalization" as the answer to  |
|economic growth, which in terms of rural electrification,     |
|equates to the privatization of traditionally public          |
|utilities. This notion, refered to as the "Washington         |
|Consensus" is experienced in the most detrimental form when   |
|these ideas are turned into stipulations for receiving aid    |
|from the IMF and World Bank in the form of "Structural        |
|Adjustment Programs" (SAPs). The ideology behind these ideas  |
|is economically deterministic - complete faith in the market  |
|as the answer to development. It's supporters argue that      |
|publicly owned utilities only lead to inefficiencies and a    |
|misallocation of resources, and without competition, these    |
|industries lack incentive to decrease costs. In theory, these |
|statements are true, only it fails to address what happens    |
|when privatization and market liberalization occur before     |
|proper social programs and regulations are put into effect.   |
|Often times "privatization" does not mean competition and     |
|increased efficiency, it means foreign investors with no      |
|concern for social issues buying electric companies, thereby  |
|inheriting an effective monopoly. Corrupt government officials|
|would be rewarded heavily by the foreign company into         |
|undervaluing electric companies to be sold below their value. |
|With a monopoly, foreign firms with no regard for the social  |
|implications of their actions could then hike up prices. What |
|was once poor service would become cutthroat.                 |
|This sequence of events is not uncommon. In the Dominican     |
|Republic, for example, World Bank funded the construction of a|
|power plant, half of which Enron then acquired in 1995. Four  |
|years later, as the Dominican Republic privatized their energy|
|sector, Enron claimed a higher percentage of Dominican        |
|Republic's electricity industry. Power rates then skyrocketed,|
|followed by rolling blackouts. After citizens also discovered |
|that Enron and other foreign companies had purchased their    |
|public electric company almost $1 billion less than its real  |
|value, rioting ensued killing eight people. Riots due to      |
|Enron's practices as a buyer of a previously state owned      |
|electric company have also occurred in Panama, Columbia,      |
|Guatamala, Bolivia, India, and numerous other developing      |
|countries13. In fact, this scenario has happened so frequently|
|in developing countries that it's argued that electrification |
|projects funded by development agencies help large,           |
|multinational corporations secure business deals and expand to|
|new markets as opposed to helping developing countries.       |
|Research from the Institute of Policy Studies shows that nine |
|out of ten World Bank energy projects benefit corporations    |
|from a G-7 country (US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France,       |
|Britain, and Italy 14.                                        |
|The support of the international community is crucial for the |
|knowledge, financing, technology it can provide, as well as   |
|building capacity. However, empirical evidence suggests that  |
|local initiatives are more likely to reflect the desires of   |
|that specific population. In contrast, international          |
|development projects can often fall into the hands of people  |
|who care less about society's welfare and more about the      |
|bottom line. As members of the international community, it is |
|our responsibility to hold these agencies accountable for     |
|their actions by speaking out against injustice and fighting  |
|for those who, due to poverty, can't be heard.                |

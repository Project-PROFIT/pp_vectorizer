Rural Electrification/Telecommunications Program
The Rural Electrification and Telecommunications Program
is based on seven principles
presented in both the
Rural Telecommunicaton Policy and Guidelines and the
Rural Electrification Policy and Guidelines.
 Principles 
A. Responsiveness to the needs
of rural Yukoners
The provision of services will be in response to requests from rural
property owners.
B. Public participation
The rural property owners that may benefit or be directly impacted
will have the opportunity to participate in both the planning and
decision-making processes for the projects.
C. Democratic project
approval
The approval of the projects will be determined through a democratic
vote of a special majority of the property owners in the project area.
D. Cost-effective, prudent
planning, utility standards
Services must be planned from an area and community development
perspective consistent with applicable standards and impacts for the
systems as a whole.
E. Full cost recovery
Property owners within a project area must contribute a fair share of
the full costs for providing services to their properties.
F. Equitable and proportional
distribution of costs
Property owners who receive an equitable benefit from a rural service,
both at the time the service is provided or at a subsequent time,
should pay an equitable and proportional share of the costs of the
service.
G. Creating partnerships
The provision of services should be achieved by property owners,
service providers and the Yukon government working in a
cooperative, open partnership.

 What is the Rural Electrification/Telecommunications Program? 
The Rural Electrification and Telecommunications Program promotes
the extension of electrical and telecommunications services to rural
property owners.
The electrical service part of the program is jointly sponsored by the
Yukon Development Corporation (YDC) and the Yukon Department
of Community and Transportation Services (C&TS). The
telecommunications part of the program is sponsored by C&TS.
The program applies to a single site or to a group of properties in
larger geographic areas to help property owners with financing for
rural electrical and telecommunications projects. It also provides
support with planning, design and project management.
Who may apply?
Generally, you may apply on your own or with a group of property
owners in the same area if your property is in a rural area where the
Yukon government is the property tax authority. The program does not
apply to properties inside incorporated communities.
Who may not apply?
Developers who are constructing and servicing a subdivision are not
eligible for the program. Developers who own a minority number of
the total properties in a service area may qualify to take part in the
Verification of Support Vote and Project Approval Vote.
Who pays for the program?
Rural property owners who take part in the program may receive a
repayable loan from the Yukon government. Funding is limited to a
loan maximum of 25 per cent of the total assessed value of the land
and improvements in the project area. Property owners pay a local
improvement charge (levied under the Assessment and Taxation Act) to
repay the loan annually over a defined period, or they may pay in a lump
sum.

Climate Change & the Financial Sector:
An Agenda for Action
A publication of Allianz Group and WWF
FOREWORD
Climate change poses a major risk to the global economy: It affects the wealth
of societies, the availability of resources, the price of energy and the value of
companies.
At the same time, the need to revolutionize the way we use energy opens up a
new universe of options for economic development and social benefits.
The financial industry has a two-fold responsibility. On the one hand, it needs
to prepare itself for the negative effects that climate change may have on
its business and on its customers. On the other hand, it can significantly help
mitigate the economic risks and enter the low-carbon economy by providing
appropriate products and services.
Allianz Group and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have joined forces
to produce a report that will advance the debate in the financial community,
and to propose solutions. The report identifies risks for the sector which are
due to climate change, and develops actions that demonstrate how integrated
financial services companies, such as Allianz Group, can turn these risks
into opportunities. Implementing these actions will mean big steps forward in
developing sound business for a living planet.
WWF and Allianz Group will work together to implement the actions of this
report and to make bold steps to help solve this global problem. Allianz and
WWF strongly believe that companies that are ready to seize these new opportunities will ultimately be able to reap significant economic benefits.
This cooperation between Allianz and WWF is the first milestone towards raising
the awareness of climate change among the financial industry and towards a
broader dialogue aimed at improving the management of environmental risks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Executive Summary
1. Climate change is real
Climates have always been changing. But this
time there is one big difference: the changes are
principally man-made. The issue has become
urgent because the pace of change is accelerating.
This report identifies actions for key stakeholders: Allianz Group, its clients, co-financiers and
policymakers.
Europe is not only warming 40 percent faster
than the world as a whole, but has already sustained severe damage from climate change. Storms
in 1999 and floods in 2002 each cost 13 billion
euros, while a heat wave in 2003 cost 10 billion
euros. Although no precise estimate of all future
costs can be made, a European Commission paper
puts the future cost of all the potential cumulative
global damage at 74 trillion euros at todays value
if effective action is not taken.
Climate change will have a multitude of effects
on human society and on nature if we fail to take
clear actions to slow it down. While milder winters may seem an attractive proposition for Europeans, it is a prospect that deceives. Climate
change will lead to increased heat stress, a rise in
insect-borne diseases, and increases in rates of
skin cancer and food poisoning. Globally, climate
change already results in about 160,000 deaths a
year, and this is likely to rise sharply because of
increasing shortages of food and water.
The extraordinary heat wave in 2003 caused
27,000 deaths in Europe and disrupted agriculture, inland shipping, and electricity production.
Huge swathes of forests covering a total of 5 percent of Portugals surface area were destroyed in a
loss put at one billion euros.
By the end of this century such a summer
could be routine. Mediterranean agriculture
might be in a state of collapse. Everywhere in
Europe rainfall will be more intense. The number
of major floods in Europe has already risen from
one per year to 15 in recent decades. In the UK,
the annual cost of flooding this century will rise
to as much as 30 billion euros. Businesses are
increasingly reporting reduced profitability because of unusual weather. Many European Union
holiday destinations will suffer  in a region
where travel and tourism generate about 4 percent of GDP.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. Climate change policies are
changing the economics
Governments are starting to introduce policies to
tackle the causes and combat the effects of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and these policies will
alter the economics of entire industries. They will
affect company share prices, both positively and
negatively. Examples from industry show that
proactive strategies tackling CO2 emissions reap
economic benefits. And climate change might not
be the only reason for taking such steps. Other
benefits of climate change policy might include
reducing dependence on energy imports, achieving more reliable energy price levels, ensuring
clean air, and creating jobs. The growth of carbon
markets associated with emissions entitlements
offers revenue opportunities for developing countries and more efficient companies, and will
need a range of services from the financial sector.
International emissions trading could be worth
between 50 and 800 billion euros in 2025.
Climate change policies will have an effect on
a number of industry sectors. The most sensitive
sectors are either energy-intensive, such as cement,
aviation, metals or energy industries such as oil
and gas, coal, power utilities; or provide energyconsuming products such as automobiles.
The driving force behind much of the current
carbon market activity is the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Some of the early warnings of
huge effects in certain sectors seem unlikely now,
but the current market price has climbed to over
20 euros per tonne of CO2 (May 30) which is not
negligible.
There has been a steady flow of research
reports looking into the issue of carbon constraints on corporate earnings since 2002. They
demonstrate that there are clear differences in the
present value of corporate earnings, across a range
of possible future climate policy scenarios. This
means that managements and investors cannot
assume that there will be time to react to policy
when it is approaching implementation.
A WWF study found that certain electricity
companies could face costs of as much as 9 per-
6 Climate Change
cent of gross earnings, though costs may be
passed on, while low-cost producers can extract
larger margins. A Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW) study concluded that 8 out of 18
cement companies were overvalued by up to
13 percent.
3. Financial sectors need for
consistent, long-term policy
frameworks
To combat the negative effects of climate change
consensus exists that the global average temperature should not increase by more than 2 degrees
Celsius and rather stay below this threshold.
This will imply a cut in annual GHG emissions
of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 globally, from the
current level of almost 7 billion tonnes of carbon
to under 2.5 billion. In line with these targets,
individual EU member states have already
announced national greenhouse gas reduction
goals that support a path of deep and consistent
reductions. For example, France proposes a 75 percent reduction by 2050, the UK a 60 percent cut by
2050, and Germany is considering a 40 percent
cut by 2020. However, specific actions are rarely
defined beyond a horizon of 2012, the conclusion
of the first Kyoto commitment period.
Early action is needed to provide greater certainty for business, long-term investment and
technological change. Inconsistent policies or no
policies at all simply deter investment. Among
the inconsistencies: the EU subsidized fossil fuels
by 24 billion euros in 2004 compared to 5.3 billion euros for renewable energy sources; and
international transport fuel is tax-exempt. The
best strategy would involve a mix of actions on
energy efficiency, including conservation measures, renewable energy and switching to low CO2
fuel and gases. Perhaps half of the potential growth
in emissions could be saved by greater energy
efficiency.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
4. New risks and new demands for
financial services companies
The financial services industry needs to adapt its
internal processes and policies and its products
and services to meet the challenges its clients face
as well as to safeguard its own viability. To enable
financial services companies to play a responsible
role in mitigating climate change they require a
reliable, transparent and international co-ordinated policy framework as well as long term, appropriated CO2-reduction goals. That gives certainty
for investment decisions and provides business
opportunities for clients.
In order to adapt their own operations to the
new challenge, financial services companies should
include climate change risk in their internal governance procedures, in line with the existing
financial corporate risk identification, controlling
and reporting structures and best practice in
reporting requirements.
INSURANCE
Climate change and climate policy affect insurers
through the risks they accept from clients. Since
climate experts predict changes in the intensity
and distribution of extreme weather events (especially water-related and storms), and because of
the resultant risk of catastrophic property claims,
insurers are likely to regard climate change as a
threat rather than an opportunity. The high number of tropical storms worldwide pushed insured
weather losses in 2004 to a record 32 billion
euros. While the incidence of tropical storms is
not conclusively linked to climate change, their
increased frequency is part of a pattern of higher
activity.
Projections for the UK from the Association of
British Insurers suggest that by 2050 the annual
cost of weather claims will double to 3.3 billion
euros, while an extreme year might cost 20 billion
euros. In Germany the total exposure to flood
damage in one event might be 15 billion euros.
Climate change is increasing the potential for
property damage at a rate of between 2 and 4 percent a year. Because insurance pricing relies on
historical data, this could lead to an underpricing
of weather risks by as much as 30 percent due to
the time lag between the historic data that is used
to set prices, and the future period in which
claims will occur. In Allianzs global industrial
insurance business for example, around 35 to
40 percent of insured losses are already due to
natural catastrophes  mainly floods and storms 
so this could materially affect the overall profitability of insurers. Other effects are expected to
include claims for loss of sales, heat stress among
clients or staff, damage to vehicles, travel delays,
and pollution from floods.
But climate change will also bring more
demand for conventional risk transfer and open
opportunities in new areas such as emission
reduction projects.
Insurers Agenda for Action:
 Gather information on future climate risks and
thereby better predict and underwrite climateassociated risks.
 Control their exposure to natural catastrophes
and other climate-related risks by developing
adequate risk assessment tools such as flood
zoning and establishing expertise for natural
catastrophes.
 Upgrade risk assessment methodologies such
as identifying potential new liabilities from
carbon emission or using environmental due
diligence screening of a company.
 Develop risk management expertise regarding
low carbon technologies jointly with industrial
clients to develop new products supportive of
low carbon technology.
BANKING
Banks play an important role in climate-related
financing and investment, credit risk management, and the development of new climate risk
hedging products. On the downside, they face
credit risks because policies to cut emissions can
create costs for carbon intensive sectors and companies. Price volatility in carbon markets (CO2,
oil, gas, coal) and climate-related commodities
leads to uncertainty in financial projections. For
Climate Change 7
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
example, the price of CO2 varied between 5 and
20 euros per tonne in the two years to June 2005.
But climate change also creates opportunities.
According to the World Energy Council, the
renewable energy market could be worth 1.4 trillion euros by 2020. The global carbon market in
2010 could be worth up to 200 billion euros, estimates Point Carbon. Exploiting the Kyoto Mechanisms could enhance project returns by up to 15
percentage points e.g. in methane reduction projects. Weather derivatives offer potential to banks:
the total notional value of this market rose to 3.5
billion euros in 2003/04. Emission trading creates
new relationships between corporates: cross-border, cross-commodity, cross-product, and that in
an increasingly international context. Significant
new investments will be required internationally
in high value added technologies for both large
and small scale aspects for each project. A key
challenge here is to marry long-term investment
horizons with short-term regulatory change.
Banks Agenda for Action:
Banks taking leadership on climate change issues
will therefore need to
 Review and optimize their own carbon risk
management and (further) develop assessment
tools applied to carbon risks and carbon risk
reduction strategies (e.g. by using carbon related economic analysis for sectors or companies
and/or by developing climate change related
risk matrixes).
 Define clear risk requirements for clients
regarding carbon risk reduction and market
strategies (e.g. by discussing rating requirements with clients).
 Foster the development of carbon risk hedging
products e.g. derivatives.
 Facilitate finance for public programmes that foster the introduction of low carbon technologies.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
Climate change is one of the most financially significant environmental issues facing investors
today. It distinguishes itself in the fact that it has
implications for a number of sectors that are
exposed to policy-driven strategies to mitigate
climate change. Therefore, understanding to
what extent and how climate change will impact
or enhance the value of investments is crucial if
shareholder value is to remain protected. Although
there is increasing evidence to suggest that climate change considerations are starting to permeate into investor thinking, it is an issue that as
yet still lacks incorporation into mainstream
investment considerations. Barriers exist in the
lack of understanding of the implications and
uncertainty around climate change policy and
regulation which remain complex.
Furthermore, the availability of comparable
and consistent data on companies emissions levels, as well as tools to assess risks and opportunities remain limited. Looking at the asset management chain of responsibility  institutional
investors, consultants, fund managers, financial
analysts and companies  each face different
challenges. But what is clear is that each one of
them can take specific action, primarily to develop understanding and respective tools regarding
the financial implications of climate change.
Specifically, fund managers and financial analysts should:
 Evaluate their client portfolios for climate
change risks and opportunities in order to be
able to respond to changes in climate change
policy and legislation.
 Engage with company management to understand how climate change is impacting their
business and what strategies they are employing to minimize its risks or maximize opportunities from it; educate clients about the benefits
and processes being used to incorporate extrafinancial issues in the management of their
assets.
 Request and reward external research providers
e.g. brokers to produce consistent, quality, long-
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
term research, which incorporates extra-financial issues such as climate change and integrate
such issues into their mainstream analysis and
investment decisions also by utilizing the help
of their in-house or external SRI expertise.
5. Financing low-carbon energy
The solution to climate change is essentially to
convert the worlds economies to low-carbon technologies, through both alternative energies and
more efficient energy conversion. Low-carbon
energies can be a contribution to the mitigation
of GHG emissions and a business opportunity for
project developers and investors.
The future outlook for the low-carbon energy
market is promising. According to the International Energy Agency investment in cleaner energy at present is USD 20 billion a year, mainly to
solar and wind power, expected to grow to USD
100 billion globally within 10 years. Investment
in renewables and clean energy technology rose
150 percent between the years 2000 to 2004,
across a wide range of applications (efficiency,
windpower, fuel cells, etc.).
The growing market opens increasing opportunities for financial services providers.
However, renewable energy technologies, given
their innovative character, often face a number of
additional barriers compared to other projects,
e.g. technical problems or higher upfront costs.
Therefore it is necessary to develop specific
expertise and financial involvement in low-carbon energies and to diversify the risks of such
energy projects.
6. Adressing climate change is
5. crucial for the financial sector
Climate change will increase costs for the financial
sector if no action is taken. Banks and investors in
particular need a clear regulatory framework on
climate policy which they can adapt and base
their investment and lending decisions on, while
insurers face the prospect of heavy losses.
Integrated financial organisations need to be
aware that climate change could result in a compounding of risk across the entire business spectrum, diluting some of the benefits of diversification. For example, an insurer is exposed to
property losses from extreme events, but so too is
a property investor, and also a banker providing
services to the property management sector. Furthermore, if the insurer seeks to reduce his risk by
withdrawing cover, other stakeholders (investors,
bankers etc.) are left with greater, uninsured risks.
Therefore, integrated financial organizations
need to develop pro-active strategies to manage
the increasing risks due to climate change.

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
Human-induced climate change has rapidly become an important factor for the financial sector
in its insurance, banking and investment activities. For centuries the financial sector has been
involved in the management of climate variability through its provision of credit for seasonal
cycles of agriculture, selection of suitable investment opportunities, and insurance against natural disasters, and has gained an invaluable fund
of experience in that area. However, now the
changes are not random, and the rate of change is
accelerating. The details of the future climate are
still unclear, and in fact they depend critically
upon the way we manage our business and social
affairs and use the land. It is clear that planning
for the future properly, means anticipating different weather patterns and different economic
structures from todays. The risks faced by clients
will be different, and the returns on their present
and future investments will change from the customary ones. The challenges will spring from a
number of directions  physical changes in the
environment, regulatory moves to limit greenhouse gas emissions, legal challenges to inadequate governance, reputational fallout from the
corporate position on climate change, and competitive pressures as production costs shift and
products are substituted in response to the new
economics of a carbon-constrained world.
In matters that affect them and their clients,
financial companies have a duty also to join the
debate to ensure that the outcome is efficient.
Because of their involvement in every strand of
the economy, and their dependence in the longterm on sustainable economic development, integrated global financial companies like Allianz
need to take a broad, objective view. This is par-
10 Climate Change
ticularly valuable, since their views ought to
reflect the best outcome for society as a whole.
The position as assessed by this report is that
there is already enough information to see that
business as usual is not an option  the undeniable costs of prevention are less than the potential
damage that could result. Nor is there time to wait
while knowledge about the climate change
process is improved, and energy technologies are
refined  early reductions in greenhouse gas emissions avoid the need for much sharper cuts later.
The main sections of the report discuss these
points in more detail. Section 1 The Direct Cost of
Climate Change assesses the evidence about the
economic costs of climate change. Section 2 The
Economic Implications of Climate Change Policies considers the business effects of policies and
measures intended to reduce the growth in greenhouse gases. Section 3 The Necessary Path then
discusses what the best option for climate change
policy is in the light of the costs and benefits of
sustainable development. In section 4 Financial
Services: New Risks, New Opportunities we look
at the implications of climate impacts and policies for the financial sector in its three main
branches: insurance, banking and asset management. Section 5 Financing Low-Carbon Energy
gives a more specific discussion of the concrete
options to facilitate market penetration for sustainable technological solutions. Finally, section 6
Recommendations identifies the key messages,
and action points for the principal stakeholders
including Allianz Group, its clients, and policymakers. Naturally, the specific mix of actions
needs to be seen in the context of each financial
market, but there are strong common elements
throughout.
1 THE DIRECT COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The Direct Cost
of Climate Change
Climate change will touch almost every aspect of
life. Here is an assessment of financial impacts 
first, globally; with some emphasis on two key
impact areas health and water; and, secondly,
relating to Europe.
1.1 The Global Perspective
Climate change will alter weather patterns and
make the sea rise. The overwhelming scientific
consensus is not only that the change will be considerable, but also that change has already taken
place because of greenhouse gas emissions. The
most recent comprehensive global perspective is
the 2001 IPCC Report1, which warned that climate change could reach dangerous levels this
century. The next IPCC report is due in 2007, but
already it seems clear that, in the light of recent
research, the risk will be revised upwards from
the 2001 assessment (see Section 4 Financial Services: New Risks, New Opportunities).
Climate change will increase the unreliability
of water supplies  both in quantity and quality. It
will decrease agricultural yields in the tropics. It
will cause a rise in sea levels and thus threaten to
displace tens of millions of people from coastal
settlements. It will cause extreme temperature
stress and cause shifts in the location of some diseases. And it will result in insurance losses from
extreme events.
Putting a cost on climate change presents massive problems. Climate changes impacts are wideranging, cannot be modelled in detail, and trying
to place a value on damage in the distant future
poses problems that border on the philosophical.2
In spite of these difficulties, an EU Commission
paper puts the potential cumulative global damage at 74 trillion euros at todays value if action is
not taken to prevent climate change. This amount
is equivalent to a cost of 80140 euros per tonne
for CO2, compared to the current market level
of around 19 euros per tonne. More important,
aggregating costs and benefits is misleading because gains for some are taken to cancel out losses for others.3 Tropical countries may be particularly exposed. Coral decay caused by temperature
rises and acidification could cost over 200 million
euros a year in the Caribbean. The cost of Hurricane Ivan that hit Grenada in 2004 amounted to
twice the countrys GDP.4 The adverse outlook for
water, crops and sea-level rise in developing countries mean that more people will be harmed by
climate change than benefit from it.
In the short term, the rich north would benefit
because of warmer winters while the poor would

become poorer. But even the wealthier nations
would eventually have difficulties if climate
change were to gather momentum, as shown in
shown in Table 1. Even short term, problems in
developing countries might destabilize the world
economy. There are two reasons. First, an increasing proportion of industrial and service activity is
located there, so that disruption would affect the
whole supply chain. This has not yet been factored into the projections. Second, an increase in
inequality could trigger criminal and civil disorder on a large scale.
These considerations are underlined by the
possibility that climate change may accelerate
due to chain-reaction effects as certain thresholds
in the climate system are exceeded (see Box 1),
leading to influxes of climate refugees.
The cost of natural disasters can be crippling
for developing nations. The World Bank has inadvertently become the worlds third largest reinsurer after Munich Re and Swiss Re because it
has to divert so much of its development funds
into disaster relief. Rich countries are vulnerable
too, but they have the resources to cope. Japan for
example has two million people living below
high-water level, and assets of 400 billion euros in
that zone. Climate change will double that exposure by 2100.
Among the concerns that Japan needs to deal
with are heat waves. Each increase of 1 degree
Celsius in air temperature reduces the efficiency
of nuclear power plant by between 1 and 2 percent but at the same time increases demand by
5000 megawatts (MW).5
Water shortages are set to increase even in a
stable climate simply because of economic development. Industry is greedy for water. 5 billion
people will have inadequate access to drinkable
water by 2025. Consumption is also increasing in
countries where populations are growing and becoming wealthier. Climate change will worsen this
in Central Asia, the Mediterranean region, south-
Box 1
Rapid Climate Change
Climate change projections depict a
gradual increase in temperature and
precipitation. However, prehistoric data
shows that at least eight times in the
past 11,000 years there has been an
abrupt onset of a radical new state.6
Ice-cores show that the average temperature in Greenland shifted by
10 degrees Celsius in 5 years, and
that annual snowfall halved within
3 years. One of the key triggers
appears to be the failure of the Gulf
Stream or thermohaline current (THC).
Shutdown of THC could result in
catastrophic changes in ice cover or
vegetation, dramatic shifts in the
water cycle, and a sharp drop in temperature for the North Atlantic and
all those regions which border the
12 Climate Change
Atlantic (East Coast USA and Canada,
Western Europe).
A study commissioned by the Pentagon7 concluded that disruption and
conflict will be endemic features of
life if abrupt climate change occurs,
and that many countries needs will
exceed their carrying capacity with
consequent large population movements. Contrary to the Hollywood
blockbuster The Day after Tomorrow,
the possibility of this event occurring
before 2100 is very small,8 and general planetary warming would cushion
the effect to some extent.9 However,
there are already signs of change in
the North Atlantic: weaker currents,10
and changing temperature.11
It is more likely that climate
change could accelerate due to natural
feedback mechanisms, such as the disappearance of tropical rainforests, the
thawing of tundra, and the shrinking
of ice-cover; all of which would speed
up global warming by increasing
the level of greenhouse gases, or the
absorption of heat by oceans. Already
the official UK climate models at the
Hadley Centre are indicating such
possibilities in some of their projections.12 The changes would compound
themselves, because natural systems
(e.g. forests and rivers) might start to
fail due to the high rate of change, and
the risk of unstable weather patterns
would also be much higher.
1 THE DIRECT COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE
ern Africa and Australia by 2025, adding another
500 million to the water-deprived. Around the
world, the land surface hit by drought has risen
from 15 percent to 30 percent in 30 years.13 Many
reservoirs in Australia are at only half capacity. A
2002 drought there cut farm output by 30 percent, lowered GDP by 1.6 percent, and cut 70,000
jobs.14 In Africa, the Maghreb faces a rainfall
decline of up to 40 percent by the 2050s. This in
turn carries the risk that refugees will be driven
away by drought and start heading for the EU.15
In places like Peru, California and India, the loss
of glacier water will cause problems for hydropower, agriculture, and consumers, and lead to an
ultimate conflict over resources.16 In southern
Africa, as much as 8 percent of GDP could be lost
because of hydropower shortages.
Paradoxically, the flood risk will increase even
in drought-prone regions because climate change
concentrates precipitation. Warm air can carry
greater amounts of moisture than cold air. When
it rains, the run-off will be faster because of sunbaked surfaces. Rapid urbanization of low-lying
coastal areas means not only an increase in population densities but also increasing levels of assets
being placed at risk. The risk of urban flooding
will increase due to outdated drainage and other
infrastructure deficits. Individual country studies
such as in Egypt, Poland, and Vietnam have estimated that the costs of rising sea levels will be in
the tens of billions of euros. Although science
remains unable to provide definitive information
about future storms, it is notable that 2004 was a
record year for both hurricanes in the USA and
typhoons in Japan.17 The storms lasted longer
than usual and reached further north than normal. In addition, Brazil was struck by its first-ever
hurricane-like storm.
Temperature increases of up to around 2.5 degrees Celsius can have positive effects on food
production. For example, milder winters prolong
growing seasons in higher latitudes.18 The effect
is less in the tropics because of the existing high
temperatures.
Overall, the effects of climate change on
human health will be adverse, particularly for the
poor because of their vulnerability to flooding
and to heat stress combined with greater humidity and air pollution. Diseases like malaria will
spread. Climate change already causes about
160,000 deaths a year because of hunger, poor
water quality, respiratory problems, and drowning. This will be greatly worsened by shortages of
food and persisting difficulties in obtaining clean
water.19
1.2 The European Perspective
The facts make it clear that action needs to be
taken urgently. A European Environment Agency
report in 2004 said Europe is warming 40 percent
faster than the world as a whole.20 Across Europe
the negative effects will be greatest in the south
and east.21 Hot summers will double in frequency
by 2020 (in Spain, they will occur five times as
often) and increase tenfold by 2080. Cold winters
will halve in frequency by 2020 and be non-existent by 2080. Summers will be drier in southern
Europe and winters will be wetter in northern
Europe.
Severe damage is already evident. Storms in
1999 cost 13 billion euros, floods in 2002 13 billion euros, and a heat wave in 2003 10 billion
euros. A total of 14 climate-related incidents since
1987 have cost over 75 billion euros, while the
annual cost of climate disasters in the EU region
has doubled to 8 billion euros in 20 years.22 By
2070 rivers in southern Europe will be carrying
half the water they do now while those in the
north will be carrying half as much again. Even in
regions that become drier, rainfall will be more
concentrated. The risks of flooding will rise. An
analysis of catastrophe damages suggests that a
1 percent increase in precipitation is associated
with losses of up to 2.8 percent.23 Already the
number of major floods in Europe has risen from
one per year between 1900 and 1974 to 15 a year
between 1993 and 2001.24
In the UK, floods cost 1.5 billion euros a year.
By 2070, this could be twenty times as much.
Climate Change 13
1 THE DIRECT COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE
10 percent of UK property with a value of 300 billion euros (5 million people in 2 million homes) is
at risk from flooding. The Thames Barrier can be
improved but the limits to protecting London are
expected to be reached in the 23rd century  or
about 150 years from now. This is because in
practical terms, flood defences can only be raised
another 2 meters.25 Good emergency warning
systems mean that deaths from flooding are
relatively low.
The extraordinary 2003 heat wave caused
27,000 deaths in Europe and massive social disruption.26 Agriculture and inland shipping were
badly hit, power supply was affected as nuclear
power plants had to be shut down. This was said
to be the hottest heat wave in a thousand years.
While it is possible that the heat was part of a
natural fluctuation in weather patterns, some
specialists believe the probability that human
influence caused the heat wave to be at least
75 percent. The probability of similar heat waves
is projected to increase a hundredfold over the
next decades.27 The upshot might threaten the
very existence of agriculture in Southern Europe.
An insight into the potential for destruction came
in 2003, when forests covering a total of 5 percent
of Portugals surface area were destroyed in a loss
put at one billion euros.28 Any benefits in the
north from an extended growing season and CO2
fertilization may be cancelled by pests, weeds, and
drought. Warmer winters will benefit health in
Europe, but the negative consequences will include
increases in the incidence of heat stress, tick-borne
diseases, skin cancer, and food poisoning.29
The burden of the changes will be uneven.
Some economic sectors such as the construction
industry might benefit from climate change30.
Others, such as manufacturing, are climate-neutral. But still others, such as insurance, water and
travel and tourism, are vulnerable. Often the
immediate physical effect will be dictated by
geography but the impacts are not limited to the
direct physical results. Increasingly, businesses
report unusual weather affecting profitability.
Travel and tourism generate about 4 percent of
GDP in the EU. Preliminary calculations with the
14 Climate Change
Mieczkowski Tourism Climatic Index indicate
that many more locations will become unattractive than will gain from climate change. For
example, Seville could become too hot for comfort by 2020. Elsewhere, lower Alpine ski runs are
already relying on artificial snow. Traditional
activities like winemaking in France and Spain
may become non-viable in some regions. Golfing
at traditional coastal sites might be so badly hit by
the weather as to be placed in jeopardy.31
Farming accounts for 1.7 percent of the EUs
GDP (more in accession countries) and employs
4.2 percent of the workforce. A temperature
increase of up to about 2 degrees Celsius might
result in increased yields. However there will be
problem years and problem areas. The 2003 heat
wave caused losses of between 30 and 40 percent
of the grain crop, while 4.5 million chickens died
in France. Bad harvests in Russia are expected to
double by 2020 because of drought, with some
regions likely to face a decline in yields of up to
40 percent by the 2070s.32 Forestry productivity
in northern Europe has already increased by
10 percent, but water shortages and heat stress in
the south will cause drought, wildfire, erosion
and desertification.
For economic activity, what matters is not necessarily changes in average temperatures or rainfall but changes in climate extremes. For example,
models suggest that temperatures of average
summers in Prague will rise by 3 degrees Celsius,
but that the heat wave temperatures could rise
by 10 degrees Celsius. Similarly, the incidence
of heavy rain there will increase by 20 percent
at the same time as overall rainfall declines by
20 percent.33 Such patterns are already emerging
elsewhere.
Table 2 presents data from UK rainfall and
temperature statistics, which reach back further
than any other source available. Extremely warm
months are occurring almost three times the statistically predictable levels; a change that began
suddenly in the 1990s. Since then, cold months
have almost vanished. This period has seen a number of severe storms, and also an increase in soil
subsidence. There is no clear sign of a trend
1 THE DIRECT COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE
towards either wet or dry months, but the current decade has been hit by severe flooding. A
sector which is clearly exposed to extreme conditions is the insurance industry, but this is ameliorated by the fact that, outside the UK, the risk is
often borne formally or informally by the state or
by the victims themselves.
Conclusions
1. Potential losses from climate warming are
incalculable in detail, but a European Commission paper estimates a global figure of 74 trillion euros if effective action is not taken.
2. Rises in sea level will threaten to displace
entire coastal communities and destroy their
assets with severe disruption to adjacent regions
and the finance sector.
3. Poor countries will be the first to be hit by
climate change, but this will set off a reaction
in the supply chain that will eventually affect
wealthier countries.
4. Widespread drought and shortages of water
will lead to problems for agriculture, hydro
power and, ultimately, to a conflict over
resources.
5. In Europe, where warming is happening faster
than elsewhere, flooding is already costing
huge amounts, with worse to come.
6. Health systems will need to come to terms
with increases in certain diseases such as skin
cancer as climates warm.
7. Insurance companies were the first financial
sector companies affected by the impacts of
climate change. Today the impacts extend to
literally all branches of the sector.

2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
The Economic Implications
of Climate Change Policies
The problems of climate change have their origins in the greenhouse gases created from economic activity.34 Because these emissions were
once considered as harmless by-products, their
side-effects were not included in the cost of production. Even as economic progress was giving
millions of people higher standards of living,
climate change remained a nebulous concept that
would take place sometime in the future and not
a visible, immediate issue.
This means that deliberate intervention is needed
to alter behavior patterns.35 In 1992, the countries
of the world met under the auspices of the United
Nations and agreed on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The key aim of this is to avoid dangerous climate
change while permitting economic development.
The primary objective is to reduce emissions
from economic activity, and the second is to
lessen the impact of unavoidable climatic changes.
Under the UNFCCC, strategies to control greenhouse gas emissions and limit damage from climatic extremes are known as policies and measures respectively for mitigation and adaptation.
Mitigation policies draw the most attention, because they affect the whole economy and often
feature unfamiliar regulations. Adaptation is
directed only at vulnerable activities, and may
simply be an extension of current measures. The
key instrument is the Kyoto Protocol (see Box 2).
16 Climate Change
2.1 Mitigation Policy
Mitigating the effects of climate change is not as
expensive as many people think. Often there are
significant, immediate benefits such as clean air
and new jobs.
Carbon emissions could be cut by between 20 percent and 40 percent by 2020 using current technology, estimates the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change. It says half that reduction would
cost nothing extra while the rest would be subject
to a modest cost of around ten euros per tonne
of CO2.36
Efficient lighting can cut lighting bills by between 50 and 75 percent with a payback in one to
three years.37 BP claims to have saved 500 million
euros over three years by introducing voluntary
internal carbon constraints, encouraging its workforce and management to seek both greater efficiency and new sources of revenue from by-products.38 Similar stories come from other members
of The Climate Group, an association of companies, cities and regional administrations devoted
to spreading good practice in the area of climate
change.
But climate change might not be the only reason for taking such steps. Other reasons might be
reducing dependence on energy imports, achieving more reliable energy price levels, ensuring
clean air, or creating jobs (45,000 new jobs were
created in wind power industry in seven years).39
Another benefit of mitigation is the incentive
to innovate. The development of wind-powered
electricity is a prime example. Ultimately, supplies of conventional gas and oil need to be
replaced anyway. Similarly, the growth of carbon
2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
markets associated with emissions entitlements
offers revenue opportunities for developing
countries and more efficient companies, and will
need a range of services from the finance sector.
International emissions trading could be worth
between 50 and 800 billion euros in 2025.40
Policy is only beginning to take into account
climate change as an economic factor. Policy
innovations include price guarantees for renewable energy, quotas for non-fossil fuels, energyefficiency standards, compulsory and voluntary
limits on emissions, and emissions trading
schemes (cap-and-trade schemes, see Box 3).
The EU has in fact a wide range of policy initiatives in place or in prospect to fight climate
change, and will have to develop further ones.
Outside the EU, various sub-federal initiatives
are being implemented, notably in the United
States, Canada, and Australia.
2.2 Effects on the Corporate Sector
Carbon constraints will mean different things for
different sectors. Studies show, for example, that
the effects on corporate earnings for the motor
industry worldwide would vary considerably.
Earnings for some manufacturers would increase
while others would decline.
Other reports indicate that earnings globally in
the oil and gas industries would be neutral in
some cases and down in others, and that the variation would be less than in the motor industry.
The gas sector stands to benefit from changes.
Metals and mining  especially aluminum and
steel  would be vulnerable. Electricity and water
utilities would generally be able to minimize
financial impacts by passing costs on to the consumer, although one study did suggest that coalbased utilities were in some cases unprepared
while some utilities were not always in a position
to pass on costs. The option of passing on those
costs depends on the price sensitivity of demand,
Box 2
The Kyoto Protocol
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol was the first
substantive agreement to mitigate
global warming under the United
Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC). Annex 1
(38 developed countries) agreed to
reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by a total of 5.2 percent
between 20082012 from 1990 levels.
The six gases include carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and
three fluorocarbons. Other countries
agreed to adopt positive measures, but
without any binding targets. A share
of the Annex 1 obligations to reduce
the emissions can be achieved via
three flexible mechanisms: Interna-
tional Emissions Trading (IET), Joint
Implementation (JI) and the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM).
Under IET, industrialized countries
can trade part of their emissions
budget known as Assigned Amount
Units (AAUs). In principle, this trading regime applies to nation states,
although the participation of companies is not explicitly excluded. JI and
CDM are project-based mechanisms,
since new emission certificates are
generated via specific emission reduction projects. Under JI, an industrialized country invests in an emission reduction project in another
industrialized country and receives
credits for achieved emission reductions  so called Emissions Reduction
Units (ERUs). Under the CDM, an
industrialized country invests in a
project in a developing country and
obtains credits for emission reductions
called Certified Emissions Reduction
Unit (CERs). The Kyoto Protocol
entered into force on February 16,
2005, but was somewhat diminished
in impact by the non-ratification of
key parties, including the United States
and Australia.
In addition to the Articles on mitigation, there are also important ones
on adaptation, particularly for developing nations, and awareness-raising.
Climate Change 17
2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
Box 3
EU Emissions Trading
Scheme (EU ETS)
The EU ETS is a so-called capand-trade scheme regulating
industrial CO2 emissions in the
EU 25. The scheme started in January 2005. The first phase runs
from 20052007, the second
phase runs from 20082012,
coinciding with the first Kyoto
Protocol commitment period.
About half of EU CO2 emissions
are covered by the scheme. It is
targetted at large individual energy-using installations in defined
economic sectors: mainly energy production, metals, construction materials, and paper. As a
market-based mechanism the
ETS ensures emissions are reduced most cost-efficiently, the
cap giving effective control over
total emission amounts.
Each EU country has to develop a National Allocation Plan
(NAP) outlining the total number
of emissions allowances (EUAs)
allocated (free of charge) to the
individual installations covered
by the scheme. According to the
European Commission, the allocation of allowances should be
in line with the member states
Kyoto commitments. At the end
of each year, each site must surrender sufficient allowances to
cover their CO2 emissions for
that year. Failure to do so will
result in fines  40 euros per
tonne of CO2 in the first period,
and 100 euros in 20082012. In
addition, the deficit must be
compensated for in the following year.
Companies can meet their
targets by implementing measures to reduce CO2 emissions or
by buying surplus allowances
from other firms i.e. trading. The
so-called linking directive from
2004 allows emissions credits
from JI/CDM projects under the
Kyoto Protocol to be used within
the EU ETS.
as well as market regulation and market inefficiencies. Even more challenging for utilities is to
make investment decisions to replace or upgrade
existing infrastructure today while at the same
time accommodating the long-term outlook of
decreasing future emission allocations.
The driving force behind much of the current
carbon market activity is the EU ETS (see Box 3).
Although it started on January 1, 2005, it is still
evolving as emissions allocations had not all been
approved by that date. Some of the early warnings
of huge effects in certain sectors seem unlikely
18 Climate Change
now, but the current market price has climbed to
over 20 euros per tonne of CO2 (May 30) which is
not negligible. The International Energy Agency
believes the effect of the EU ETS on international
competitiveness of whole economies is marginal,
as eligible companies receive free entitlements
for most of their emissions. Nevertheless, sensitive sectors are the energy-intensive industries
(cement, metals), or those which produce energy
(oil and gas, coal, power utilities). Rising power
prices combined with rising oil and CO2 prices
are likely to negatively impact energy intensive
industries located in Europe, in particular when the
rate of growth in Chinese demand is slowing.
There has been a steady flow of research
reports looking into the issue of carbon constraints on corporate earnings since 2002. Naturally the earlier findings were somewhat speculative, because the status of the Kyoto Protocol was
uncertain, and the EU ETS was not well-defined.
The fact that the studies come from different
sources (banks, investment brokers, policy analysts, energy industry institutes etc) and are
broadly in agreement means that one can use
them to frame strategies.
In some cases the analysis is simply qualitative, but it may still be useful given the great
uncertainties in policy implementation, and the
fact that climate change is only one influence on
corporate performance.
Most of the results below relate to the EU ETS
specifically. However the first three are broader,
and contain an important general message. They
demonstrate that there are non-trivial systematic
differences in the present value of corporate earnings, across a range of possible future climate policy scenarios. This means that managements and
investors cannot assume that there will be time to
react to policy when it is approaching implementation, because there are strategic structural factors such as access to resources and technology, or
customer mix, which take longer to shift. A second point that recurs is that some sectors face
several environmental challenges, and that tackling greenhouse gas emissions may interact with
some of those other problems.
2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
A study of the general effect of climate policy
on the automobile industry across the world by
The World Resources Institute (WRI) concluded
that the effect of carbon constraints on the corporate earnings of individual companies ranged
from an increase of 9 percent to a decline of 10
percent, reflecting factors such as the likely compliance costs to match potential emissions controls on vehicles and the manufacturers customer
mix. Most interestingly, the study examined a
range of scenarios and concluded that a company
such as Toyota which had a strong R&D program
on technologies that might replace the internal
combustion engine would have a distinct advantage in every scenario.41
A second study in the same general, non-EU
series by WRI looked at the oil and gas sector
globally, again using a scenario approach to issues
such as the Kyoto Protocol and found systematic
differences, but over a smaller range, from marginally positive to a decline of 5 percent in earnings.42 Curiously, Exxon Mobil, which has campaigned against early action on climate change,
was not as vulnerable to mitigation policy as
some other petrocarbon companies.
ABN/AMRO carried out a multi-sector study,
which identified metals and mining as the most
affected industry, particularly aluminum and
steel.43 On the other hand gas (the cleanest fossil
fuel, and an easy substitute for coal) and platinum
(for fuel cells) will benefit. The analysts felt that
electricity and water companies would be relatively unaffected because costs could be passed
on to customers. Car manufacturers might face
potential brand issues (along the lines of the campaign what car would Jesus drive?). Cement
companies in Annex 1 countries might be forced
to focus on special-purpose products because of
external competition. The study named individual companies in each sector as winners or losers
but the selection was different from other analysts and not quantified.44
Turning now specifically to EU ETS, in an early
study of the power sector DrKW rightly felt that
emissions regulation was inevitable. If a tough
allocation of permits was adopted the effect on
wholesale electricity prices might be as much as a
70 percent increase. Initially, it looked as if the
National Allocation Plans (NAPs) would be too
loose, but then they were tightened by the European Commission. In fact, DrKW had already
foreseen two years ago consistently high prices
for CO2 of above 15 euros per tonne. UBS adopted a four-scenario approach to look at company
prospects. It found that coal-based utilities (such
as RWE) faced an uncertain future, with a spread
of 70 percent in valuations. By contrast, the
British utility SSE was stable with positive upside
in all four scenarios, because it would receive a
windfall benefit (free emission allowances). The
sector would become less commodity-like with
premiums for green electricity, and merger and
acquisition activity might be stimulated. The
effects would ripple along the value chain to fuel
suppliers, and heavy consumers.45 Power companies do have a range of options to respond with
the exact choice of which would depend on the
carbon price, and factors like vertical integration,
availability and use of renewables, and diversification intentions.46 WWF commissioned a study of
utilities which found that companies in phase 1 of
the ETS were unprepared. Some could be affected
by up to 10 percent of earnings because it was not
always able to pass on costs. Accepting the considerable uncertainty on NAPs, companies could still
plan responses such as switching from coal to gas.
Wholesale electricity prices in the UK might rise
by over 5 percent, the report said, but this now
seems unlikely.47 Other environmental issues
that interact with climate change here are acid
rain, water quality (outflow from cooling), and
landscape aesthetics.
The effect of emissions trading on the energy
sector should soon be clearly visible as an important factor in investment decisions regarding generation assets, i.e. technology and fuel choice.
Cement currently accounts for 5 percent of
global CO2 emissions. These emissions are growing at 4 percent per year. CO2 emission reductions
in this sector can be achieved by a number of
strategies. However, to achieve deeper long-term
cuts new ways to reduce the CO2 impact of the
Climate Change 19
2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
cement sector will have to be developed. Uncertainty over the allocation of emissions permits
does not provide the necessary incentives for the
industry.48 Other construction materials (such as
glass and clay) have strong local pricing power,
which enables energy costs to be absorbed, or
cannot be transported long distances. A DrKW
study of the impact of EU ETS reduced target
share prices on eight out of 18 companies in the
cement sector by up to 13 percent and altered
investment recommendations on several.49 This
is broadly confirmed by McKinsey, whose experts
note that while on average the effect may not be
great, the impacts will vary greatly between companies depending on individual circumstances,
and also what other mitigation measures are in
hand in firms primary areas.50
Some energy-intensive sectors  like the aviation
sector  are not within the ambit of the EU ETS so
far. However, the sector is growing so rapidly, at
about 5 percent per year, and its impact is so large
(possibly 10 billion euros in terms of climate
damage) that it cannot be ignored by policy makers much longer. Potentially 15 percent of total
human-induced climate change may be due to the
aviation sector by 2050.51 Both a fuel tax solution
and the inclusion of the aviation sector in emissions trading are currently being discussed on
the political level  the airlines themselves (e.g.
Lufthansa and British Airways) prefer emissions
trading.52 Due to the large impact of the sector on
climate change, climate policy regulations for the
sector could have considerable consequences for
the cost calculations of the airlines. DrKW estimates that corporate profits could be reduced by
1015 percent by an EU-wide fuel tax.53
The related sector of travel and tourism generates about 4 percent of GDP in the EU, and,
mainly because of sun, sea and sand tourism,
accounts for about 0.75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions from Northern to Southern
Europe.54 As shown in section 2 The Economic
Implications of Climate Change Policies, this
industry is vulnerable to direct climate impacts,
so it faces a doubled exposure to climate change if
the cost of travel rises because of higher energy
20 Climate Change
prices. It has been ignored in investment studies,
probably because its market capitalization is
small. But the social impacts could be very large 
it is a high employment sector, and also ranks
high in consumer awareness.
Finally Nikko and Citigroup note a number of
opportunities in power technology as climate
change policies begin to show effect. Energy efficiency technologies as well as renewable energies
will likely provide increased opportunities for
financiers.
2.3 Effects on the Consumer Sector
Consumers will be affected by emissions regulations indirectly through the cost of goods and services55, and also through increasing emphasis on
energy efficiency in household and transport use.
In the EU, the price effect of industrial sector regulation will generally be small, at least until the
second phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme.
The effect on high-street prices will be minimal;
many non-energy factors in production process
will be little affected. Although the impact is likely to be greater between 2008 and 2012, when the
Kyoto Protocol targets have to be met, governments are likely to be careful about taking direct
action that might hit the consumer sector such as
introducing steep increases in energy prices or
raising taxes.
Increasing emphasis will be placed on energy
efficiency, and the setting of energy performance
standards for all major types of equipment
(cars, domestic appliances) as well as real estate
(see Box 4). Though the capital cost of more
efficient equipment may be higher, the wholelife cost may be less once energy savings and
reduced maintenance are allowed. Voluntary
standards run the risk that consumers will opt for
cheaper equipment, ignoring the savings that
come later.
Once consumer hardware becomes generally
more energy efficient, policies leading to energy
2 THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES
Box 4
EU Energy Performance
of Buildings Directive
European Member States will have to implement the Energy Performance of Buildings
Directive (EPBD) by January 4, 2006 at the
latest. It is intended to bring about a major
uplift in the efficiency of energy consumption
in building stock, which accounts for 40 percent of EU final energy demand. There are
four key measures: introduction of a sound
methodology to calculate energy performance;
price increases will gain more widespread acceptance. The value of older equipment and property
will decline in relative terms as their running costs
increase. For consumer goods which are quickly
replaced, it would be ideal if this entire process
could take place within the time frame of the
Kyoto Protocol  that is, by 2012. For property, the
situation is more complicated because demographic trends and ownership patterns vary
markedly across the EU, as does the replacement
rate of domestic property stock. (Currently only
about 0.1 percent of the UK housing stock is
demolished every year).
A key element in getting consumers to play a
part in emissions reduction is education. One
consequence of higher efficiency is the rebound
effect. Instead of accepting the savings from
reduced consumption, consumers change their
behavior to raise consumption back to previous
levels. They increase home heating or drive farther or faster. Consumers need to learn to be
energy-wise, to monitor consumption and to consider whole-life costs. For people with less disposable income such as the elderly or single parents,
even small cost increases from climate policy may
be burdensome, and policymakers will need to
consider this.
application of minimum standards to new
buildings and larger old buildings at the time
of major renovation; certification of buildings
performance when built, sold, or rented; and
regular inspection of heating and cooling systems. Only industrial and historic buildings
are excluded, and any buildings frequented by
the public will have to display a certificate of
energy efficiency.
Conclusions
1. Managements and investors should not assume
they will have time to react to policy when it
is approaching implementation. Proactive engagement with policymakers to plan ahead for
business changes is required.
2. Climate change mitigation measures are often
inexpensive, and the savings and side benefits
may accrue quickly.
3. Governments need to bring in unambiguous
policies so investors are not deterred. Companies need clear signals and directions from policymakers about future climate change related
regulations.
4. Carbon constraints will have different effects
on the earnings of companies, both from sector to sector and within sectors.
5. Some measures to combat climate change will
have significant side-benefits as well, such as reducing reliance on imports, stable energy prices,
cleaner air, employment and innovation.
Climate Change 21
3 THE NECESSARY PATH
The Necessary Path
Since the last report of the International Panel on
Climate Change in 2001 much new evidence has
arrived showing that the risk of climate change is
considerably worse than previously thought. The
sensitivity of the climate system has been underestimated (see Box 5). New factors like acidification of the ocean have been identified56. The
disappearance of polar icecaps57, 58 and tropical
forests59 is almost inevitable, unless we act soon.
3.1 Avoiding Dangerous Climate
Change
Climate has to be measured in many ways for an
accurate picture, but the key statistic is the average
temperature. The Earths temperature takes a long
time to respond to changes in the atmosphere,
because the land and water are so massive. Waiting until the temperature has stabilized is therefore not an option, because damaging impacts
may arrive before equilibrium is reached. The
alternative is to select a level of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere that seems likely to just avoid
causing a dangerous equilibrium temperature
and aim to remain below that. Atmospheric levels
of concentration in gas are measured in parts per
million by volume of carbon dioxide equivalent
or ppmv cde. There is growing international consensus that global average temperature should
not increase by more than 2 degrees Celsius and
rather stay below this.
Box 5
The High Sensitivity of the Climate System
Recent observations of the atmosphere show that pollution has been
dimming the suns radiation and so
slowing down the pace of climate
change, perhaps by as much as half.
Unfortunately, it also has serious
immediate effects on plant growth,
human health, and rainfall, so it cannot be allowed to continue. If it is elim-
22 Climate Change
inated it will effectively double the
rate of global warming.60, 61 A second
source of concern is that because of
their huge size, very few variations
can be tested on climate change computer models (General Circulation
Models, or GCMs). The standard projection given for climate change is a
temperature range by 2100 of 1.4 to
5.8 degrees Celsius. A recent novel
experiment took advantage of the
spare capacity on domestic personal
computers to try out thousands of
plausible variations and found that
the range was extended at the top end
to 11.9 degrees Celsius, which would
be catastrophic.62
3 THE NECESSARY PATH
Because of these factors the European Heads of
State stated that the global average temperature
increase should not exceed 2 degrees Celsius.63
Earlier, the European Environment Ministers64
stated that this temperature stabilization would
mean require staying well below a GHG level of
550 ppmv cde, which is double the natural level
of CO2. This implies a cut in annual GHG emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 globally, from the
current level of almost 7 billion tonnes of carbon to
under 2.5 billion. In line with these targets, individual member states have already announced
national greenhouse gas reduction targets that
support a path of deep and consistent reductions.
For example, France is aiming at a 75 percent
reduction by 2050, UK a 60 percent cut by 2050,
and Germany 40 percent by 2020. However, the
most recent evidence on climate change processes reduces the safe level of GHGs by about a quarter. Therefore, to limit the rise in temperature to
under 2 degrees Celsius with high confidence
means aiming for 450 ppmv cde, not 550.65
By 2004 the GHG level was already over 400
ppmv cde and rising at 2 ppmv each year66. It is
clear that urgent action is needed to address the
divergence between what we are doing and what
we need to do and that using less energy, or using
carbon-light technologies will be needed to compensate for this. In fact, because we are not maintaining a stable level of emissions but increasing
them, it will require double the effort to achieve
a safe concentration of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Therefore deeper and faster reductions of greenhouse gases will be necessary. For
governments, waiting for more scientific certainty does not appear to be sound.67 Delaying action
by 20 years could mean reducing emissions very
rapidly later (three to seven times faster to meet
the same target). On the other hand, early action
overcomes the inertia of the climate and socioeconomic systems, and provides greater certainty
to business for long-term investment and technological change. To take an analogy from physics, the
static friction that prevents movement is much
greater than the kinetic friction that opposes a
moving body.
3.2 What is Good Policy?
A key issue is finding policies that work. Because
there are many barriers to change (such as the
long-life of capital stock, fear of risk, problems of
scale, transition from laboratory to marketplace),
to inspire confidence and innovation policies
must be loud, long and legal.68 That is, they must
be unambiguous, well-signalled in advance, and
enforced reliably. Cinergy, a major coal-dependent utility in the USA, has publicly called for
emissions regulation by the federal government,
because there is a proliferation of sub-federal
initiatives, but more importantly because investing in cleaner technology is expensive and cannot
be justified economically without a change in
operating regulations.69
At present, businesses are faced with mixed
signals on energy technology. EU-15 subsidized
fossil fuels by 24 billion euros in 2004, compared
to 5.3 billion for renewables. International transport fuel is tax-exempt, yet air transport is the
fastest-growing source of emissions.
Absence of policy is in fact worse than unfavorable policy, since the risk of policy change
deters any investment. Long-term policy planning can have a strong payback in economic
terms. Providing 10 years warning of a fiscal tax
can reduce the cost by one-third as efficient
processes can be implemented beforehand. Costs
will be lower if new technology is introduced as
part of the business cycle. Much of EU power
capacity needs to be replaced within the next
20 years (at a cost of 1.2 trillion euros), which
raises serious issues for those countries and companies in particular that currently operate on
the basis of a fossil-fuel heavy generation portfolio or electricity sector. If the restructuring can
be accomplished with low-carbon technology,
new plants will not have to be retired early. Developing countries like China and India are expanding rapidly, with huge investments in new infrastructure and buildings. Both situations offer a
golden chance to introduce climate-friendly solutions in the course of economic expansion or
replacement.
Climate Change 23
3 THE NECESSARY PATH
Creating new energy technologies can be costly
and risky. Generally this means that it does not
suit investors requirements. The private sector
operates on a short duration-high risk to long
duration-low risk front. Unfortunately, this is the
reverse of technological development, where the
longer the gestation, the higher the risk. This
means that governments need to provide support
for lengthy programs to reduce the risk profile.
Yet globally, government energy R&D has fallen
from a peak of over 10 billion euros in 1980 to
under 6 billion in 2001, and most of the spending
was concentrated on nuclear power. Some countries also heavily subsidize fossil fuels at the
expense of funds available for new technologies.
Policy changes are creating a perception of
greater risk for investors in the energy sector due
to increased uncertainty about fossil fuel economics. This can be countered to some extent by
reducing the uncertainty in renewables, but in
such a dynamic situation it seems inevitable that
investors will have less appetite to participate in
the energy sector until policies have crystallized
and new business models have emerged and
stabilized.
A second area of concern for the private sector
is the so-called valley of death for innovators. To
get from pure research to the marketplace, innovations have to pass through a number of stages,
from basic R&D to demonstration, to niche market and then full commercial production. Governments are often prepared to support the initial
phases of innovation, but are reluctant to pick
winners  that is, to support manufacturers in
the wind-up to full-scale production and marketing, between the demonstration to niche market
phases of development. Since this is a cash-burn
situation, when the costs are still high and the
revenue is insignificant, it is unattractive for
investors. Nevertheless major American institutional investors have announced a target of
investing 400 million euros into clean technology
including renewable energy in the near future,
and have set up the organizational structures
to achieve this with external advisors. Allianzs
private equity arm Allianz Capital Partners has
24 Climate Change
entered renewable technologies. So far, Allianz
has bought the wind power gearbox manufacturer Hansen Transmissions for 132 million euros.
More major investments will follow.
A crucial issue is how climate change will be
tackled internationally. There are many possibilities. The finance sector would like to know now
what goals for emissions will be set for after 2012,
when the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period
ends and what instruments will be used to
achieve them. Financial companies see emissions
trading systems as having great potential in emissions reduction efficiency with a range of business opportunities. This requires transparency
and reliability in rules and regulation, based on a
clear downward path for reduction targets to
achieve the required CO2 target levels.
The sector would also like to see developing
countries involved in a way that utilizes market
mechanisms such as emissions trading.
Conclusions
1. To avoid dangerous climate change, very large
cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are required,
of the order of 60 to 80 percent by 2050.
2. This means a big shift in energy policy now.
Governments need to bring in unambiguous
long-term policies so investors are not deterred
by the increased riskiness of energy projects.
3. Climate change mitigation measures are not
always expensive, and the gains are not always
only in the long-term.
4. Carbon constraints will have different effects
on the earnings of companies, both from sector to sector and within sectors.
5. Some measures to combat climate change
might be introduced for other reasons as well,
such as reducing reliance on energy imports or
to avoid energy price volatility.

Financial Services: New
Risks, New Opportunities
Climate change is creating new risks but also
new opportunities for all sectors of society from
changing weather conditions to greenhouse gas
abatement measures. The financial services industry needs to adapt its internal processes, policies, products and services to meet the challenges
its clients face as well as to safeguard its own
viability. This survey looks at each of the three
branches of financial services  insurance, banking, and asset management  as well as issues that
affect institutions in all three.
4.1 Insurance
Climate change and climate policy affect insurers
through the risks they accept from clients. Since
climate experts predict changes in the intensity
and distribution of extreme weather events (especially water-related and storms), and because of
the resulting risk of catastrophic property claims,
insurers are likely to regard climate change as a
threat rather than an opportunity.
Insurers need to adapt to climate change by
assessing how changing weather patterns will
influence their clients exposure. They must adapt
their risk assessment and review their underwriting (pricing, contract conditions and risk acceptance procedures) with a view to their specific
risk exposure (line of business, geography, etc.),
and business opportunities as well as the type
of customer (private, commercial, industrial) they
are focussed on (see Table 3).
Beyond this core business activity, mitigation
offers some interesting new opportunities for
insurance. In some cases, insurers may be able to
assist clients that are involved in renewable energy or energy efficiency technologies. In this way the
insurance industry can offset its short-term risks
arising from polluting and inefficient technologies and also decrease its long-term risk arising
from extreme events.
4.1.1 Adapting to Climate Change
I M PA C T O N I N S U R A N C E
Adapting to climate change is a huge challenge
for insurance. Insured weather losses from property damage in 2004 hit a record 32 billion euros
because of severe storms in Japan and USA.70
Such storms, their frequency, location, timing and
intensity are a strong indication of climate
change. Their occurrence is also part of a strong
upward trend in catastrophe costs in other locations like Europe71 and Australia.72 A study by the
Association of British insurers has found that
climate change is increasing the potential of property damage at a rate of 2 to 4 percent a year.
Since insurance pricing relies on historical data,
this could lead to an underpricing of weather
risks by as much as 30 percent.73
 In Allianzs global industrial insurance business, for example, around 35 to 40 percent of
insured losses are due to natural catastrophes.
More than three quarters of these losses are
from storms and floods, so the overall effect of
ignoring a trend would be serious. Potentially,
climate change will make storms worse because
a warmer atmosphere will contain more energy
and transport more rain.
Here, research in co-operation with modelling
centers is necessary to better identify regional
Climate Change 25
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
impacts of climate change. On balance, climate
change in Europe may prolong human life
because of milder winters, but it could also bring
increased burdens for health insurers and pension funds. Other effects are expected to include
claims for loss of sales, heat stress to clients or
staff, damage to vehicles, travel delays, and pollution as a result of floods.
How insurers react to trends or scientific evidence varies greatly between the lines of insurance. For industrial and large commercial clients,
contracts are renewed every year and the portfolio can be totally altered, taking into account
Table 3

Change-Related Risks
and Opportunities
for Insurers
Adapted from ABI 2004
the number of contracts in regions particularly
exposed to risk of climate change. Trend assessments can help to investigate the vulnerability of
different industrial sectors. However, extreme
events occur in bursts, so that there are quiet
periods that lead to a form of inertia and scientists are reluctant to commit themselves on individual events, so market and regulatory forces
may be the decisive factors. Finally, to be able to
react at all, insurers need to survive the first
onslaught  several insurers in Florida did not
survive Hurricane Andrew.

For private and small commercial clients (mass
markets), however, policies are not regularly
reviewed. In fact, these policies generate the bulk
of claims, for example during the Elbe flood of
summer 2002 in central Europe. Changing the
strategy in mass markets is much more difficult
compared to industrial clients, due to regulatory
and other pressure, which leaves insurance companies with a substantial climate related residual
risk in mass markets.
4.1.2 Insurance Solutions to Tackle
Climate Change Business
Risks  European Examples
Insurance practices vary greatly across Europe.
The following pages give an overview of how the
issue is being tackled in Allianzs major European
markets.
 In Britain, where much analysis has been carried
out, cover against weather perils is wide-spread.
Projections suggest that climate change will double the annual cost of British weather claims to
3.3 billion euros by 2050, while an extreme year
might cost 20 billion euros. Research suggests
that the underlying weather risk is rising at 2 to
4 percent a year, which could lead to an underestimate in pricing of as much as 30 percent
because of the time lag between the historic data
used to set prices and future claims.74 A particular issue in the UK is flood insurance. The industry is introducing a competitive risk-based pricing structure to replace the old uniform tariff. This
requires cutting-edge analysis with geographical
information systems and catastrophe models.
 Norwich Union has developed its own risk
maps by using aerial surveys and is now selling them to other insurers. As a result it was
found that 10 percent of property to a total
value of 300 billion euros is at an immediate
risk of flooding.
 The industry is also working with the government and other stakeholders to control the
risk through land-use planning, infrastructure design, and funding for maintenance.
 In Ireland, which has a similar insurance system to the UK, insurers are hampered by the
absence of a public post-code for real estate.
Allianz Ireland has therefore geo-coded the
bulk of its risks itself in order to apply a riskrelated underwriting approach. An important
resource for carrying this out has been the 15man internal risk survey force, which provides
local knowledge about flood hazards for example. The government has just released its first
assessment of future climate impacts in Ireland,75 and this will help insurers to improve
their planning.
 In much of Germany flood insurance is available for private and industrial customers.
Allianz and other insurers supported the development of a zoning system based on the calculation of probability of flooding using geological
data to allow risk-adequate priced insurance.
Research commissioned by Allianz and other
German insurers indicated that the total exposure to flood damage in one event might be
15 billion euros.76 This reflects the fact that
flood defences in some regions are rather weak
(only good against a 30-year flood in former
East Germany, for example).
 The Czech Republic was hit hard by floods in
both 1997 and 2002. Unlike in 1997, little reinsurance cover was available in 2002 because of
low reinsurance capacity after the World Trade
Center attack in 2001 and the concurrent stockmarket crash. It was clear that risk management was worth investing money in. At the same
time public geo-data was obtained to construct
risk maps by combining internal insurance
data and public data (see Figure 1). By working
directly on model development itself, Allianz
has side-stepped the black-box syndrome
associated with proprietary models previously
used. These models allow individual properties
to be underwritten more precisely. However
historical data is not sufficient and it is impossible to check the programmed logic of proprietary models which makes it difficult to assess
how effectively they will cope with novel circumstances. The company is now exploring the
Climate Change 27

potential costs of various flood scenarios by
applying its data to hydrological models.
 Geological and hydrometeorological hazards
generate important economic losses and social
damages in Spain. The country is especially sensitive to the impact that desertification could
have in certain areas of Spain, such as the center
and the south, and the possible consequences
of a sea level rise in the coastal zones.
Overall, floods produce the most important
losses, having reached in the last decades an
annual average of losses of around 0.1 percent
of the gross domestic product.
Projections made by the Geological Survey of
Spain estimate losses due to floods will total
25.7 billion euros over the next 30 years.
In this context, it is remarkable that the Spanish
Consortio77 coverage has provided a reliable protection against these climatic events in the past.
Last year the Consortio introduced important
modifications, giving much wider coverage in
order to insure all major climatic event scenarios.
 In Italy Allianzs Italian subsidiary RAS adopts
a territorial area approach to implementing
underwriting rules and principles. The publicly
available data on flood hazards is still not
adequate for a thorough risk assessment, so
insurers are cautious in this area. Improvements in river banks, beds and maintenance
programmes in general are under way, but due
28 Climate Change
to failure in the past in enforcing regulations
on land development, property in certain areas
remains exposed. Insurance cover for climate
change related events is mostly restricted to the
commercial lines sectors. The price-driven
small and medium enterprise market tends to
generate an adverse risk selection. As a consequence, the offer of coverage and the development of a diversified weather risk portfolio
are limited. Storm and atmospheric events
coverage, however, is widespread. Apart from
flood events recorded in the north of Italy in
1994 and 2000, the market was hit last winter
by heavy snow falls. The peak loss was 2.5 million euros, due to a collapsed roof, which highlighted the importance of building codes and
the quality of construction.
 Elsewhere in Europe, the public sector often
prefers to operate a solidarity system of crosssubsidy for weather risks, through disaster relief
or public insurance. For example, in France,
there is a well-established public cat-nat reinsurance system which uses the private sector
for administration. However, one aspect that
causes some problem is that a disaster has to be
declared by the local prefect to trigger the cover which can lead to anomalies. After severe
droughts in the period 19892002 which caused
three billion euro worth of damage to buildings, a double trigger method was established,
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
based on water table and soil typology to give
an objective way of defining drought-hit areas.
Yet, this method has its limitations; as it was
not able to cope with the drought of 2003 which
caused over one billion euros of damage in a single year. It was not preceded by a dry winter,
which was a criterion to provide coverage. The
methodology is therefore being reassessed.78
The expected increases in losses from climate
change as described above will result in greater
demands for public and private insurance mechanisms to provide compensation to victims, particularly in flood-prone areas such as coasts,
river catchments, and steep valleys.79 This will
be counter-productive unless appropriate attention is given to risk management, which is where
the insurance industry could play a valuable role.
Insurers need to focus their attention on solvency
management by assessing their exposure to catastrophe scenarios and arranging reinsurance.
 For example, Allianz Group set up two big
catastrophe (Cat) programs to optimize its
use of reinsurance and to increase the group
protection against worst case natural perils:
1. Super Cat covers medium-sized events in
Europe and Australia up to return periods of
250 years by pooling the potential losses of
the Allianz entities.
2. The Mega Cat program reinsures the top
natural peril scenarios of Allianz Group up
to return periods of more than 1,000 years.
Both tools make extensive use of the good
geographical diversification of the different
Allianz entities. Depending on the scenario,
these two covers provide NatCat protection
of more than 1.5 billion euros, so that even
more intense events due to climate change
should be covered.
The regulatory boundaries of insurance make
some risk transfer solutions complicated.80 For
example, new risk transfer tools like weather
derivatives are not regulated as insurance products, and there is a basic presumption that catastrophe risk can be accounted for on a one-year
basis, although it is closer to the multi-year nature
of life and pensions business.
4.1.3 Insurers Risks and
4.1.3 Opportunities in Mitigating
Climate Change
New technologies are ultimately more efficient
and represent better risks. Therefore there is a
natural interest for insurance companies to
Box 6
Upgrading Technology
to Protect the Environment
Supplementary to any compensation for lost
assets, insurance policies can provide financial
resources to cover costs incurred for clearance
and demolition, expenses involved in damage
limitation, outgoings for decontamination and
removal of soil, and professional disposal. If
a commercial client of Allianz in Germany
decides to include the eco-package in its property insurance, any additional costs involved
in order to upgrade facilities and protect the
environment as a result of replacing lost or
damaged items covered by the insurance will
be proportionately reimbursed. For example,
the owner of a building that has burnt down
can replace the original single glazing with
energy-saving multiple-pane insulation glazing when the structure is rebuilt. The additional costs incurred will be reimbursed up
to an agreed limit under the terms of the
eco-package.

Insurance Solutions for Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) Projects in Practice:
Carbon Delivery Guarantee
Various researches have been conducted by the financial sector to develop insurance instruments for the
greenhouse gas market as a whole and
CDM projects in particular. There is
obvious demand from project developers, investors and buyers of CERs
for risk-mitigating tools for CDM projects. Austrian Garant Insurance,
French Global Sustainable Development Project (GSDP) and Swiss Re
Greenhouse Gas Risk Solutions are
trying to meet this demand with the

launch of the first carbon delivery
guarantee insurance. A carbon delivery guarantee is an insurance product
where the re-insurer/insurer acts as
guarantor for future CER delivery, and
financial compensation is paid in case
CERs are not delivered according to
agreed terms and conditions. The carbon delivery guarantee is shaped to
meet the CER buyers demand for risk
mitigation. One of the first carbon
delivery guarantees was applied to
CERs generated by a reduction project
benchmark new technologies and thereby steer
technical innovation to effective implementation
through risk-assessment techniques as well as
consider concessionary conditions for environmentally-friendly technologies.
Thus GHG mitigation provides some interesting
new opportunities for the insurance industry. It
can influence and leverage the emergence of new
technologies in several ways. One area is property
and engineering insurance. Usually after an
insurance loss in an old industrial plant, the
insurer only has to pay for the installation of the
technology that had been in use at the time of
loss. Yet, if an upgrade of old facilities is possible,
insurance could support this technological innovation, although it is a more expensive option.
Allianz is applying this possibility in many cases
today (see Box 6).
However, as with every profit-risk ratio, every
new technology also has unrecognized or unfamiliar risks  for example offshore wind park
installations will entail cable laying, high stress
components, and salt corrosion, all of which can
in South America, which utilizes an
innovative proprietary filter technology. In total, the project consists of
1,000,000 tons of CERs. The seller will
deliver CERs annually from 2005 to
2007 and the carbon delivery guarantee is based on a purchase price of
USD 5 per CER. The insurance covers
carbon delivery guarantee, political risk
insurance (incl. host industry insolvency, seller insolvency, political and country risk) and business interruption.
potentially increase the risk of such an installation. Absence of insurance is a powerful blocker
to finance for projects in this area  some experts
believe the volume of projects might rise by
300 percent if insurance cover were available.81
This rise is expected despite the fact that insurance cover would make up as much as 11 percent
of operating costs of offshore wind parks.82
 Allianz has paid 33 million euros in the last
ten years in claims related to on-shore wind
turbines. This led the company to initiate close
collaboration between wind turbine producers,
energy suppliers and certifiers to improve the
technology and maintenance practices so that
insurance could become available later.
 In the field of geothermal energy, Munich Re
has similarly played a major role in developing
insurance cover for exploration risk.
 Loss of revenue for renewable energy producers is another potential field for new covers, for
example, for wind generators if the wind speed
is too high or too low.
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Climate policy has created opportunities to
develop new carbon products (see Box 7).
 Gerling Insurance Group is providing services
for carbon markets. A reliable database on GHG
emissions will be fundamental for operators
and investors. Gerling offers the verification
and certification of data for projects that aim to
offset carbon emissions.
Legal action has been taken by shareholder
groups to test companies responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions or disclosure of relevant
information (see Box 8). It is unlikely that insurance policies provide any scope of cover through
risk transfer from the original emitters. This is an
area which will warrant careful monitoring in the
light of the way that other claims for environmental or health damage have developed  such
as for asbestos claims.
 Swiss Re already reviews corporate responses
to the Carbon Disclosure Project (see Box 10)
for clients requiring Directors and Officers
insurance, to assess corporate carbon emission
strategies and to see if further inquiries are
needed.
Another area still to be explored is the valuation of carbon assets and liabilities, setting an
appropriate price for the risk of loss, and adjusting the loss when it happens. A variety of novel
risk transfer tools have been proposed to tackle
the complicated issues of innovative technology
(catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives, contingent capital, double trigger structures, finite
insurance, captives).83 Again there are legislative
difficulties for insurers because some of these are
not classified as insurance products, and so they
will require alternative non-insurance solutions.
Conclusions
1. Climate change poses an economic risk to
insurers.
2. Major insurers are developing new techniques
for assessing the ground-level risk of extreme
weather and are adjusting their underwriting.
3. New insurance products can support climatefriendly technology but insurance companies
focus mainly on the adaptational aspects of
climate change induced risks.
Box 8
Liability for Climate Change?
Businesses that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases could be held liable for the
damage that is caused by climate change, and
so might providers of financial services to
such companies. The Alliance of Small Island
States, and more recently the Climate Justice
Network, have suggested that compensation
should be paid for impacts such as communities affected by sea level rise. In 2002 Friends
of the Earth, Greenpeace and others launched
a suit against two federal agencies, the ExportImport Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, for providing financial support illegally of over USD 32 billion to fossil
fuel export projects without assessing their
contribution to climate change in the USA.
More directly, on 21 July 2004 eight states and
a number of NGOs in the USA filed against
five major electricity utilities that are collectively responsible for 10 percent of USAs
emissions for creating a public or private nuisance by discharging carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere, contributing to climate change.
In this case the plaintiffs are not seeking damages, but simply an injunction compelling the
companies to reduce their emissions by set
amounts over a specified timetable.

4.1.4 Recommendations
4.2 The Banking Sector
Insurers should:
 Gather information on future climate risks and
thereby better predict and underwrite climateassociated risks.
 Control their exposure to natural catastrophes
and other climate-related risks by developing
adequate risk assessment tools such as flood
zoning and establishing expertise for natural
catastrophes.
 Upgrade risk assessment methodologies such
as identifying potential new liabilities from carbon emission or using environmental due diligence screening of a company.
 Develop risk management expertise regarding
low carbon technologies jointly with industrial
clients to develop new products supportive of
low carbon technology (such as multiperil cover for renewable technologies, loss of revenue
cover for renewable technologies, eco-package
for Allianz Property/Commercial Clients).
Banks can play an important role in societys
adjustments to climate change. They do this
through financing and investment decisions,
credit risk management policies and lending
practices, and the development of risk-mitigation
products. Climate change policies pose new risks
and offer new opportunities to banks. The most
striking ones are outlined in Table 4.
4.2.1 Climate Change-Related Risks
The biggest risk to banks is credit risk. This is
related to new climate change mitigation policies
(legal/policy risks). Policies to reduce greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions  most importantly the
Kyoto Protocol and the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme (EU ETS)  transfer new liabilities and
therefore business risks, e.g. via tradable emission certificates, to the economy. These policies

influence the credit quality of GHG-intensive
borrowers and therefore the risks of banks. The
EU ETS is directly targeted at company level and
creates direct costs of compliance on related sectors and indirect costs on all consumers of energy
and electricity. In particular the energy sector,
which accounts for 63 percent of the EU emissions
market (see Figure 2), is affected.
 As a consequence of the EU ETS, Point Carbon
predicts higher electricity prices across the EU
with additional costs of between 260 to 600 million euros/per year for the sectors affected.
 DrKW Research concludes that cement companies with large exposures to EU countries
could be affected by the EU ETS with estimated
extra costs for individual companies of up to
15 percent.
Looking at the current developments in the
international climate policy arena, it is likely that
the EU ETS and the Kyoto Protocol only mark the
beginning of a more rigorous future global climate policy regime. This, of course, has implications for banks in their important role as loan
providers, equity investors, and project financiers. Besides those credit risks, banks face operational risks from inappropriate internal risk
assessment processes and a consequential misassessment of such carbon-related impacts, e.g.
banks internal failures in the climate due diligence for investments or loans lead to decreased
margins. On top of this, the related operational
risks for the banks clients, for example, suboptimal carbon risk management, can result in
financial sanctions which also impair the clients
liquidity and therefore the banks competitiveness and creditworthiness. Within the EU ETS
40 euros per ton must be paid for excess emissions from 2005 to 2007, from 2008 the sanctions
are 100 euros/ton. In addition to the financial
sanctions, the amount of the deficit in allowances
is carried over to the following year, which creates
additional price and volumetric risks for the
affected companies.
Market risks are significant for banks and their
clients. The main ones are volatile carbon certificate prices, volatile carbon-related commodity
Power
& Heat
Building
Metals
Oil and
prices (e.g. coal, gas, oil) and the insufficient availability of EUAs at the market. These price and volumetric risks lead to decreased corporate planning reliability  both for banks and their clients.
The price for EUAs moved between 5 to 20 euros/
ton between March 2003 and May 2005, displaying extremely high volatility and therefore high
uncertainties in the EU ETS.
 DrKW Research in 2003 has been estimating
15 euros/ton as a likely price for EUAs for
the period 20052007 and foresees even higher prices for the period from 20082012, in
case the reduction constraint tightens for the
companies affected by the EU ETS.
In addition, changes in fuel prices as well as
movements in EUA prices will influence the socalled merit order of energy generation. Banks
must have the expertise to monitor and understand the impact of emissions trading on clients
business.
The more frequent the occurrence of extreme
weather events such as flooding and storms, the
higher the direct climate change related risk of
physical damage to corporate assets and real estate.
 The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates
that nearly one-third of the U.S. economy, or
USD 3,800 billion, is at risk due to the weather.
Changes in weather patterns lead to high uncertainty especially in the utility sector, but possibly also to increased energy costs for the corpo-

rate buildings of banks themselves. Weather is 
next to economic business activity  the main
influence on power and heat production and
therefore also on CO2 emissions.
Non-compliance with mitigation policies is
likely to be expensive for some companies. For
example, companies that do not comply with the
EU ETS will be put on a publicly available blacklist. These companies might become reputational
risks (and therefore credit risks). The year 2004
also saw the first lawsuit in the US accusing companies of liability for global warming. A number
of states and environmental organizations have
begun litigation charging five of the nations
largest power companies with being a public
nuisance by emitting CO2.
Investments in controversial forms of renewable and conventional energies or related projectfinancing activities (e.g. large dams, nuclear) could
bring reputational risks. The so-called Equator
Principles have been adopted since 2003 by more
than 20 major banks to mitigate such risks. The
Equator Principles are a voluntary set of guidelines
for managing environmental and social issues in
project finance lending, developed by leading
financial institutions. They are based on the environmental and social standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and apply globally to development projects in all industry sectors
with a capital cost of USD 50 million or more.
The existence of these risks mean banks need
to develop carbon risk management tools for
their loan and investment due diligence.
 Dresdner Bank has incorporated a set of emission trading related questions in its credit rating process and conducts thorough investment
research in view of the consequences of the EU
ETS for the affected industry sectors.
 UBS Investment Bank, the investment banking
arm of the financial institution UBS AG, has
launched a program to integrate environmental
and sustainability criteria into the banks overall
assessment of investment risk and opportunity.
 Other banks like Bank of America intend to
develop new metrics to demonstrate the carbon intensity of their client portfolios.
34 Climate Change
 In its Public Environmental Policy Statement
from 2005, JP Morgan announced it would
restrict its lending and underwriting practices
for industrial projects that are likely to have
an adverse environmental impact. The bank
also plans to calculate in loan reviews the financial cost of greenhouse gas emissions, such as
the risk of a company losing business to a
competitor with lower emissions and plans to
include climate risk aspects in regular company
analyses.
4.2.2 New Opportunities
Climate change not only creates new risks, costs
and liabilities for banks, it also generates economic
opportunities such as investments in renewable
energy technologies, energy efficiency projects,
emissions trading and weather markets, and climate change related microfinance.
EMISSIONS TRADING
The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in
February 2005 and the start of the EU ETS in
January 2005 have created an international emissions trading market incorporating various
opportunities for banks.
 Point Carbon estimates the volume of the international carbon market in 2010 between 4.6
to 200 billion euros. The wide spread shows not
only the remaining uncertainties but also the
opportunities. For 2005, the market-size forecast is 2.5 billion euros.
Figure 3 shows EU emissions market trading
volumes in the first half of 2005.
 Emissions trading offers new client service
opportunities for banks. First, there are financial opportunities. Since the establishment of
the EUA spot-market in early 2005, various
banks have entered the market, providing further liquidity.
 Dresdner Bank, Barclays Capital and Fortis
Bank have set up their own emissions trading
desks to provide trading services for clients and
to trade on their own account.
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Mt CO2
 Westpac has set up an Environmental Markets
Group focussing closely on emissions trading.
Emissions trading is also an interesting option
for project financiers, since the internal rate of
return (IRR) of emission reduction projects can
be enhanced through the project-based mechanisms JI and CDM.
 According to the World Bank, the Internal Rate
of Return (IRR) increase through JI and CDM at
USD 4/ton CO2 is between 0.5 and 2.5 percent
in hydro, wind and geothermal projects and
between 5 and 15 percent in methane reduction projects at landfills.
Because administering JI and CDM projects
is very complex and time consuming, these two
mechanisms are still economically risky. But because they are, in principle, promising, various
financial institutions have started to lobby for
both to be designed more efficiently.
 For the Financial Initiative of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP FI) (with members such as Dresdner Bank, UBS, Abbey, Bank
of America), the current interpretation of an
emission reduction projects investment additionality is the crucial bottleneck in the CDM
process which deters private financial institutions from getting involved in such projects.
 According to Environmental Finance, Swiss
cement company Holcim has cancelled three
CDM projects due to the regulatory problems
of the mechanism.

 In June 2001 DrKW became the first German
bank to make a temperature-related transaction
with a regional energy utility.
Against the background of the interdependency of weather changes, carbon prices and carbonrelated commodity prices, weather derivatives
provide  in particular for companies affected by
the EU ETS  an attractive instrument to mitigate
the related risks.

Weather derivatives help mitigate weather-related
risks. Initially, the use of weather-hedging products was confined to North American energy
companies. However, major financial institutions
(e.g. Socit Gnrale, Axa, DrKW) have also become players in the weather market.

STRUCTURED FINANCE
Adapting corporate investment strategies to the
new energy environment as outlined in this
document also brings interesting opportunities
for banks. The range of major facilities needing
finance sector support include renewables, and
low-carbon technologies. All of those require the
financial involvement of banks. The associated
long-term risks also need to be understood.
MICROFINANCE
Climate change-related microfinance offers innovative business opportunities for banks. Microfinance means providing poor families with small
loans (micro-credits) to help them develop tiny
enterprises. Over time, microfinance has come to
include a broader range of services such as insurance or savings. Typical clients are low-income
persons without access to formal financial institutions. Microfinance money is often used for
climate protection projects such as installing solar
power.
Data from the Micro Banking Bulletin reports
that 63 of the worlds top Micro Finance Institutions  often NGOs or credit unions  had an average rate of return, after adjusting for inflation and
taking out any subsidies that programs might
have received, of about 2.5 percent of total assets.
This compares favorably with returns in the commercial banking sector.
 An increasing number of private financial institutions like Socit Gnrale, Citibank in India
or ABN Amro are recognizing the benefits of
serving poorer clients.
Box 9
Export Credit Agencies
Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) sit
between banks and insurance. Firstly,
with a mandate to facilitate exports
from their respective countries, ECAs
can play an important role in climate
protection projects e.g. by facilitating
the financing of renewable energy
products and services. Secondly, they
provide mainly short-term credit and
specialized types of insurance e.g.
against political events. Often operating as an arm of government, they follow strict guidelines laid down by the
OECD to avoid unfair competition.
With their ability to take a wider view
following their guardian authorities,
they could play an important role in
financing mitigation projects such as
renewable energy in developing countries. Four areas of action were identified by an ECA/UNEP Working Party
on renewable energy:
36 Climate Change
1. Changes to international agreements to allow greater local content
in projects and longer repayment
periods.
2. New products/processes e.g. bundling small projects for economies
of scale, factoring in emissions
allowances, adopting non-recourse
project finance structures, and
measuring the carbon intensity of
credit portfolios.
3. Strategy: greater attention to working with other ECAs and multilateral development banks, more flexibility within the existing OECD
rules for small businesses, and outreach campaigns to target business
sectors.
4. Experiment: giving responsibility
to a team to consult widely and
pilot ideas.
Because ECAs are closely related to
the public sector, practices are scrutinized by NGOs and have resulted in
legal actions for alleged breach of
environmental care in funding fossil
fuel projects (see Box 6). A new twist
to this is calling for disclosure of information on finance activities related to
environmental issues e.g. energy exploitation, under the Aarhus Convention or further national regulations.
Against this background, the German
Government is facing action from Germanwatch, related to the German Environmental Information Disclosure
Law (Deutsches Umweltinformationsgesetz). Euler Hermes, an Allianz subsidiary and a German ECA, is acting as
ECA Federal Export Credit Guarantees
and is a potential party to the action.

Conclusions
4.3 Asset Management
1. Leading international banks now include
climate change as a factor in the credit and
investment rating process, in their overall risk
management and in due diligence for project
financing.
2. The examples of Dresdner Bank, Barclays Capital, Fortis and ABN Amro show that when climate change policies are well-articulated, they
provide positive opportunities for banks to
widen the scope of their services to clients that
have become subject to those regulations.
The extent of the impact from climate change will
vary sector by sector (see Table 5). What is clear,
however, is that overall it will have a significant
direct impact on the global economy, financial
markets and ultimately shareholder value.84 Climate change has received ever greater attention,
as Tony Blair, the UK prime minister, has placed
climate change, along with Africa, at the top of
the agenda for the UKs chairmanship of the
Group of Eight industrialized nations and the
European Union this year. Therefore, understanding to what extent and by which causal connections climate change will impact or enhance the
value of investments is crucial if shareholder
value is to remain protected.
To varying degrees, companies have begun to
look at climate change risk and its impacts on
their businesses, but the level of sophistication
varies from company to company. The financial
markets and investors are starting to recognize
the potential opportunities arising from climate
change, for example, the launch of and investment
in various carbon or environmental technology
funds.
 Allianz Group subsidiary AGF has invested,
together with Fortis Bank, 60 million euros in
the European Carbon Fund launched by the
French financial institution CDC IXIS. Currently, they are looking to invest more than 1 billion
euros in Carbon Funds.
Institutional investors are also acknowledging
that climate change can have a material impact on
their investments, and are taking action to
address the issue. Consequently, investor groups
such as the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) in Europe and the Investor
Network on Climate Change in the United States
have been established with the same common
purpose: to promote better understanding of the
risks of climate change among institutional investors and encourage companies and markets to
address any material risks and opportunities to
their business associated with climate change and
a shift to a lower carbon economy. Furthermore,
4.2.3 Recommendations
Specifically banks should:
 Review and optimize their own carbon risk
management and (further) develop assessment
tools applied to carbon risks and carbon risk
reduction strategies (e.g. by using carbon-related economic analyses for sectors or companies
and/or by developing climate change related
risk matrixes).
 Define clear risk requirements for clients
regarding carbon risk reduction and market
strategies (e.g. by discussing rating requirements with clients).
 Offer carbon risk advisory services for clients.
 Define clear requirements for rating agencies
on carbon risk in corporate and sector ratings.
 Foster the development of carbon risk hedging
products e.g. derivatives.
 Facilitate finance for public programs that foster the introduction of low carbon technologies.
 Improve the opportunities of JI/CDM project
development to generate CO2-reduction certificates for optimizing the cash flow of project
financing.
 In respect of their own operations and on a
voluntary basis, adapt frameworks such as the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or guidelines
more specifically based on the emissions inventory of the GHG protocol as an accounting and
reporting standard.

projects such as the Carbon Disclosure Project are
additional evidence of investors willing to collaborate in order to better understand the implications of climate change and to increase transparency (see Box 10).
Although the CDP and other climate change
investor groups demonstrate the rising importance of impacts from climate change for the
investment process, the issue and its consideration still remain largely ignored by the majority
of short-term oriented mainstream investors and
fund managers. As such, only a small proportion
of such investors and their fund managers are
actively considering climate change issues in the
course of their investment decisions. The reasons
behind this are varied and can be best explored by
looking at the chain of responsibility of asset
management.
4.3.1 Institutional Investors
Institutional investors or pension fund trustees
have a fiduciary duty to their pension fund beneficiaries to ensure that they act in the best, longterm interests of plan members and beneficiaries
by maximising the returns of the pension fund
assets entrusted to them. In fulfilling this responsibility, trustees must maintain maximum diversification and have an understanding of the risks
their assets are exposed to and manage them
accordingly.
38 Climate Change
b) Assumption: exchange rate GBP : EUR 1:1.5
The consideration of environmental, social or
ethical issues in the management of these assets
has started to permeate trustee thinking, as a
result of pension legislation e.g. UK Pension
Reform Act 2001 and as a result of increasing
attention being paid to these issues by consultants and the media. However, this has been limited as trustees grapple with how they should be
addressing climate change. A large proportion of
institutional investors still sees the issue within the
context of socially responsible investment which
is viewed with some skepticism as to the financial
benefits.85 Crucially, the majority of institutional
investors are finding it difficult to make the link
between climate change risk and investment risk
and consequently they are not actively instructing their fund managers to take the issue into
consideration in the running of their assets.
Given the potential impact that climate change
may have on financial performance, trustees have
yet to recognize that they have a responsibility to
consider climate change if they are to act in the
best interests of their beneficiaries. Some institutional investors, such as the Dutch pension fund
PGGM, have taken the step to actively explore the
added value of considering climate change in
their investments by allocating pools of funds to
various socially responsible investment strategies
ranging from best in class to engagement overlays. Alternatively, pension fund trustees leave
the consideration of issues such as climate change
to the discretion of their fund manager.
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Pension fund trustees are also facing a number
of significant challenges, the most pressing and
immediate being to meet their pension fund liabilities. In this respect, there is limited amount of
time available to focus on issues such as climate
change and, coupled with greater pressure to perform, so this has led to greater focus on short
term, relative performance measurement.86 This
is at odds with the long term nature of climate
change, since climate change risks are usually
talked about in the space of decades. Some
investors are looking to address this, one example
being the The Marathon Club which is a consortium of individuals representing major pension
funds to research how their funds can encourage
active long term and responsible investing. There
is less doubt than ever that climate change is a
fact, that it is happening, and that it has the
potential to pose a real threat to global economies
and financial markets.87 The remaining uncer-
tainty is when and to what extent these threats
from climate change will become a reality. Being
prudent investors, pension fund trustees need
the appropriate tools to help them understand
the implications of climate change on their
investments and instruct their asset managers
accordingly. Alternatively, they may look at the
possibility of diversifying their assets into investment vehicles that provide a hedge against climate
change risk.
4.3.2 Consultants and Actuaries
The role of consultants and actuaries as advisors
to pensions fund trustees is to provide commercial, financial and prudential advice on the management of assets and liabilities  especially
where long-term management and planning are
critical factors. Environmental factors such as
Box 10
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
The Carbon Disclosure Project was launched
in November 2003, and provides a secretariat
for the worlds largest institutional investor
collaboration on the business implications of
climate change. CDP provides the process
through which many institutional investors,
including Allianz, representing USD 20 trillion, collectively sign a single global request
for disclosure of information on Greenhouse
Gas Emissions. CDP then sends this request to
the FT500. 300 of the 500 largest corporations
in the world currently report on climate
change issues through the CDP website. The
CDP has been successful in both attracting
institutional investors to sign up to the project, starting from 35 institutions in the first
year to 143 in the third year, and getting more
companies to provide responses to the questionnaire. The CDP has helped to illustrate the
extent to which the largest global companies
are aware of and responding to climate change.
The first (CDP1) survey found that while
80 percent of respondents acknowledged the
importance of climate change as a financial
risk, only 35 to 40 percent were actually taking
action to address the risks and opportunities.
The second (CDP2) survey showed that climate change and shareholder interest are
becoming more closely intertwined. However,
significant differences in opinion remain as to
the importance of climate change to business
and competitiveness. Major discrepancies still
exist between some companies responses and
what is publicly known about their actual
climate change stance. Not all companies
respond to shareholder requests for more climate change information. CDP3 was launched
in February 2005, representing a larger group
of investors.
Climate Change 39
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
climate change should not be viewed as a natural
consideration. Given the long-term nature of
climate change and the wide-ranging impacts it
may have on client assets, this ought to be a
natural consideration for them. However, many
consultants are fairly skeptical of the moves
towards shareholder activism and socially responsible investments.88 Climate change is often
pigeon holed into socially responsible investment, which is seen as potentially interfering
with trustee fiduciary duty and an issue that falls
into the environmental rather than the financial
sphere.
There is also a significant element due to political and regulatory uncertainty. Consultants, just
like institutional investors, do not have the correct tools to enable them to understand the
impacts of climate change and as such remain
reluctant to provide advice on an issue they are
not familiar with and which does not yet fall into
their area of expertise. Given that climate change
and its impacts remains a complicated issue it
may be acting as the barrier to entry for consultants and actuaries to understanding how this
issue could impact investments, since it requires
a wide range of skills to be able to give the kind
of advice that would affect a portfolio. Among
other issues, it requires an understanding of
climate change policy and how the price of carbon may affect a particular market.89 Some consultants such as Mercer Investment Consulting
have already formalized their approach towards
socially responsible investment, and have dedicated SRI capabilities. The next steps for Mercer
include the assessment of fund managers and
how they are integrating issues such as climate
change within their traditional or mainstream
investment practices.90 Mercer is soon to publish
a report in July 2005 for the Carbon Trust and
the IIGCC, entitled A climate for change: A
trustees guide to understanding and addressing
climate risk.
In conclusion, if investment consultants and
actuaries are to take climate change into account
when advising clients, this needs to be supported
by increased awareness and knowledge building
40 Climate Change
as well as an understanding of the approaches
that fund managers are taking towards climate
change in their investment processes.
4.3.3 Fund Managers
When making decisions on a clients assets and
fulfilling a clients requirements, the core of a
fund managers decision-making process is to
evaluate the relative risks and opportunities of
their investments. Traditionally, these have been
financial and include the growth of a company,
the margins it is generating and the annual profits it is making. Non-traditional issues such as climate change do not normally fall into the realm
of a traditional fund managers thought processes, an exception being the introduction of the EU
Emissions Trading Scheme, which places a value
on the price of carbon leading to direct financial
implications for specific sectors and investee
companies. Climate change is a regular consideration for SRI fund managers whereas mainstream
managers still tend to marginalise the issue and
rarely include it in their investment considerations. There are several reasons for this. Such
fund managers are finding it difficult to make a
clear link between climate change and portfolio
risk, thus it is still being seen as an SRI issue,
and as such not relevant to mainstream investments. There is also a conflict for fund managers:
the long-term nature of climate change appears to
clash with the short-term measurement of their
performance by institutional investors, despite
the fact that such investors ought to have a longterm investment horizon.
The lack of clarity around climate change policy and its long-term time frame places a level of
uncertainty around the actual impacts this will
have on investments. The availability of investment tools to enable fund managers to evaluate
the impact of climate change is limited; although
some organisations such as the World Resource
Institute (WRI) have developed frameworks which
provide fund managers with a multidimensional
framework for assessing climate change risk in
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
their portfolios.91 The framework highlights that
greenhouse gas regulatory risk and its competitive implications are most immediate and tangible
aspects of risk. It also states that to accurately
analyse the implications of policies on greenhouse gas emissions, investors should consider
how companies respond competitively to these
policies and ultimately how this affects cash
flows. It therefore appears to be an issue relevant
to a prudent investor, which is the responsibility of the fund manager to their institutional
investor.
Fund managers are in the early stages of being
provided with the tools and information that
should enable them, better than before, to start
understanding the impact of climate change risk
on their investment decisions and ultimately
their client portfolios. These will include WRI
reports, the Carbon Disclosure Project, and support from their in-house SRI specialists who have
been evaluating the impacts of climate change on
investments for many years (see Box 11).
Having described this situation, there are
indications that mainstream fund managers are
beginning to recognize the importance and
approaches of socially responsible investment. In
their annual Fearless Forecast survey review
conducted in late 2004, Mercer Investment Consulting asked 190 fund managers worldwide
whether certain SRI practices would become a
common component of mainstream investment
processes in the near and long term. The survey
findings indicated that the majority of fund managers outside the USA are becoming more convinced that the adoption of SRI practices and
strategies will become more commonplace. Furthermore, some participants in the financial markets are recognizing the importance of integrating environmental, social and governance issues
into mainstream investment processes and have
Box 11
Socially Responsible Investment
at RCM
RCM is the core growth equity platform within Allianz Global Investors, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Allianz. RCMs in-house SRI specialists are responsible for focusing their
research on non-traditional or extra-financial
issues, by means of a proprietary sustainability scoring and rating process, which among
other issues evaluates companies on their
approach towards the management of climate
change risks and opportunities. RCM was one
of the first signatories to the Carbon Disclosure Project when it was launched in November 2003, recognizing the need for consistent
and comparable climate change information
from companies for a better research process.
RCMs SRI specialists also use GrassrootsSM,
which is a proprietary research entity within
RCM that provides the investment platform
with additional market analyses by conducting market research at the local, regional and
global levels. In SRI analyses, it helps to confirm and identify where material environmental and social factors are starting to have an
impact on a companys financial performance.
RCM SRI specialists discuss with companies
areas relating to material business issues such
as climate change, especially in instances
where companies do not fully disclose their
policies and approach towards their management. Finally, all SRI research outputs are fed
back into the RCM global investment platform, which includes RCM fund managers
and financial analysts, to aid the integration of
extra-financial issues into mainstream research
and investment decision making.
Climate Change 41
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
produced a set of recommendations for asset management, securities and brokerage to take action
under a UN-based initiative.92 This is encouraging and provides confidence that extra-financial
issues such as climate change will become more
of a regular feature in fund manager thinking.
Especially since there is increasingly strong evidence suggesting that companies with good environmental governance standards, such as the
management of climate change risks, have better
financial returns compared to those that do not.93
4.3.4 Financial Analysts
The consideration of climate change  or its lack
of  by mainstream financial analysts is based on
the very same issues as presented for fund managers. The availability and quality of climate
change information being provided by companies varies and long-term political frameworks
have not been established, making comparative
and consistent modeling and analysis difficult.
This is daunting, given that climate change is one
of many factors that both analysts and fund managers need to take into account when evaluating
investments. The Carbon Disclosure Project is,
however, aiming to address this issue. Furthermore there has been rising criticism directed at
the financial markets for its short termism, where
Box 12
Enhanced Analytics Initiative (EAI)
The EAI was set up by a group of asset owners
and fund managers to promote better broker
or sell-side research on extra-financial issues,
i. e. factors that cannot be readily quantified
but nevertheless have considerable power
over asset value. Extra-financial issues include
factors such as climate change, human capital
management, reputational risk, mergers and
acquisitions and corporate governance. The
EAI hopes to see research that identifies corporate prospects across different time scales
and sectors, integrating the findings into conventional stock-picking valuation. Members
of the EAI (which include AGF Asset Management, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Generation Investment Management, London Pension Fund Authority, Mistra, PGGM, RCM,
SNS Reaal Group, Trade Union Congress,
Superannuation Society and the Universities
Superannuation Scheme) have committed to
allocate 5 percent of their respective broker
commission budget (approximately 8 million
euros in 2005) to brokers on the quality
42 Climate Change
of their extra-financial research, as regularly
evaluated by an independent consultancy,
OnValues. The second evaluation completed
in June 2005, highlighted that there was an
increase in extra-financial research being generated, however, there is still a long way to go
with regard to the quality of research. It also
indicated encouragingly that research houses
are beginning to integrate extra-financial
research into their mainstream reports and
that the breadth of issues being researched 
including corporate governance, emerging
environmental liabilities, consumer and public health issues, and business ethics and
brand management  is expanding. However,
whilst there are signs that some research houses are gearing up to consistently provide extrafinancial research, the overall coverage and
quality of the research need to be expanded
further in order for it to become a useful tool
for the buy-side (in house financial analysts of
fund management houses).
www.enhanced-analytics.com
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
company performance is measured on a quarterly
basis rather than over the longer term, with the
trend primarily being driven by hedge funds.94
A number of fund managers and institutional
investors are, however, addressing this issue by
providing incentives to mainstream, sell-side
research analysts to produce more long-term
research, which incorporates extra-financial issues
such as climate change (see Box 12).
4.3.5 Companies
Company disclosure on climate change is improving. However the quality, comparability and consistency of this information varies from company
to company, limiting its usefulness for financial
analysis and valuation. The communication of climate change policies and strategies is mostly limited to discussions in meetings with SRI analysts
and fund managers rather than with mainstream
investors. The exception is where SRI analysts
also attend such mainstream meetings and ask
relevant questions in the presence of mainstream
investors. However, companies who have welldeveloped climate change policies and strategies
are indicating that mainstream investors are not
showing much interest in this type of information. Consequently, they do not include their climate change strategies in mainstream investor
presentations.
It is clear that there is a discrepancy here and
two things need to happen. Companies ought
to re-evaluate their investor-directed communication regarding their approaches to environmental
government  it needs to be more meaningful
and the materiality should be clearer for mainstream investors. Mainstream investors should
take greater notice of the growing evidence of
the link between good environmental and financial performance and find out why companies
do or do not allocate resources towards addressing: firstly, the challenges of climate change to
their business and secondly, the potential impact
climate change can have on the value of investments. This will not only highlight to companies
that investors are taking a greater interest in nontraditional aspects of company performance but
also put greater pressure on companies to produce more consistent and meaningful information that is useful in company financial analyses.
Conclusions
1. A few institutional investors and fund managers
have acknowledged that climate change will
have a material impact on their investments
and that they are taking action to address the
issue.
2. Investors who have been following socially
responsible investment strategies for some years
now treat climate change as a strategic factor
in portfolio performance.
3. There is increasing evidence to indicate a positive link between good corporate environmental governance, including climate change, and
good financial performance, but it is still insufficient at the corporate level in particular.
4. The comparability and quality of climate
change information provided by companies remain insufficient for credible financial analysis. Although, the availability of comparable
and consistent data on climate change as well
as tools for fund managers to assess climate
change risk in their portfolios are increasing.
5. There is a lack of understanding among both
institutional investors and consultants on how
they should be evaluating the financial implications of climate change on investments.
6. Climate change, its implications and uncertainty
around policy and regulation remain complex,
acting as a barrier to entry to institutional
investors and consultants in understanding
the related financial risks.
7. Fund manager performance is measured over
a short time frame, causing fund managers to
focus on short-term corporate performance,
which is in direct conflict with the long-term
nature of climate change.
Climate Change 43
4 FINANCIAL SERVICES: NEW RISKS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
4.3.6 Recommendations
With a growing body of evidence on climate
change, and its wide ranging impacts especially
on financial performance, institutional investors,
consultants, fund managers and analysts should
start to build up their understanding of the relevance of climate change to their advice, analyses
and investment decisions.
Specifically, fund managers and financial analysts
should:
 Evaluate their client portfolios for climate change
risks and opportunities so that they are able to
respond to changes in climate change policy
and legislation.
 Help company management understand how
climate change is impacting their business and
what strategies they can employ to minimize its
risks or maximize opportunities from it. Educate clients about the benefits and processes
being used to incorporate extra-financial issues
in the management of their assets.
 Request and reward external research providers e.g. brokers to produce consistent, quality,
long-term research which incorporates extrafinancial issues such as climate change, and to
integrate such issues into their mainstream
analyses and investment decisions with the
help of in-house or external SRI expertise.
 Challenge both buy- and sell-side analysts on
their understanding and incorporation of climate change risks and opportunities in their
investment research and ideas.
 Support the development of climate change
databases and request more consistent information from companies on their climate change
performance.
 Develop innovative investment vehicles that
capitalize on changes in climate change policy
and regulation.

5 FINANCING LOW-CARBON ENERGY
Financing Low-Carbon
Energy
The solution to climate change is essentially to
convert the worlds economies to low-carbon technologies, either through alternative energies or
more efficient energy conversion.
Renewable energy technologies can be both a
contribution to the mitigation of GHG emissions
and a business opportunity for project developers
and investors. The future outlook for the renewable energy market is promising, since ambitious
targets for renewable energy generation have
been set in many regions and countries. Germany
is taking the lead with its target to generate
50 percent of its energy needs from renewable
energy sources by 2050.
 According to the World Energy Council, the
clean technologies market could be around
1.4 billion euros by 2020.
 According to the Carbon Disclosure Project, the
proportion of major banks involved in such
investments rose from 13 percent to 31 percent
between 2002 and 2003, despite regulatory risk
problems in some markets.
 The International Energy Agency assumes that
capital and generating costs of renewable energy technologies will fall steeply over the next
decade, making such technologies more competitive. Worldwide capacity from renewables
are expected to be in the region of 400 GW,
compared with 2,000 GW for gas, 1,400 GW for
coal and 400 GW for hydro. About 1.3 billion
euros in cumulative investments will be needed
in OECD countries only to replace ageing plants
and meet rising demand.
One survey found that investment in renewables and clean energy technology rose 150 percent between the years 2000 to 2004 across a wide
range of applications (efficiency, windpower, fuel
cells, etc.). US pension funds as well as global
investors are now entering this field in a big
way, but with expert advisors to avoid expensive
mistakes.
 The Environmental Technology Program of the
Californian pension funds CalPERS will focus
on providing capital to investors who have a
proven track record, and avoid over-exposure to
any one target area by diversifying sectors and
geographical areas.95
 According to the International Energy Agency,
investment in cleaner energy at present is USD
20 billion a year, mainly in solar and wind power, and is expected to grow to USD 100 billion
globally within 10 years, compounded at an
annual growth of 15 to 20 percent.
 Allianz Group is approaching this area through
specialist operators such as Allianz Capital Partners, who now own Hansen Transmission, a
major supplier of wind turbine components.
The group sees wind energy as an important
component in its strategy to treble its private
equity exposure (currently 1.5 billion euros in
23 projects), because a diversified windpower
portfolio offers long term stable cash flow
with relatively low risk. A newly-founded unit,
Allianz Specialised Investments, will continue
investing in this sector.
 Allianz estimates that by 2010 installed global
wind capacity will be more than double its current level of around 50 GW, with more than
half of this expected to be in the European
Union.
 In Italy, Rasfin, another Allianz subsidiary, is
closely monitoring opportunities in fuel cell
technology, and also exploring possibilities to

work on clean technology with local government bodies such as cities and states, because
their decision-making processes are often quick.
Banks, in their role as lenders and investors, play
an important role in developing and promoting
the renewable energy markets. However, a banks
primary criterion for investment is the expected
profit. The due diligence for renewable energy
projects is no different compared to other investments. In addition to that, renewable energy technologies often face a number of additional barriers compared to other projects, e.g. technical
problems or higher upfront costs.
Due diligence for renewable energy projects
therefore requires special expertise. Banks analyse
renewable energy investments in particular in
view of market risks, technology risks, reputational risks and policy risks (see Figure 5).

Notwithstanding the additional barriers in the
renewable energy market, the structured finance
market for renewable energy has taken off in
recent years:
 The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reports
increasing activities of major banks in this field.
Dutch Dexia holds an outstanding in the renewable energy sector worth more than 200 million
euros. Spanish Santander Central Hispano
has financed wind farms over the past years;
an investment worth over 250 million euros.
46 Climate Change
UK Barclays, Dutch ABN AMRO and French
BNP Paribas provide tailor-made financial
services to renewable energy projects.
 Dresdner Bank founded its Renewable Energy
Competence Centre in 2004 to bundle the banks
existing expertise in the field of renewable
energy investments and lending criteria. In particular, Dresdner has developed specific expertise and financial involvement in on-shore wind
energy, solar power and biomass.
The growing market in renewable energies
also opens increasing business opportunities for
investment banks: Allianzs investment banking
arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, has conducted four large business transactions in the last
two years.
 DrKW advised in April 2005 the selling shareholders in Dersa, the Spanish renewable energy
company, on the companys acquisition by
Spains largest gas supplier, Gas Natural.
 Also in April 2005 DrKW executed a capital
increase for Nordex, the German wind turbine
manufacturer, for an equity consideration of
42 million euros.
 In May 2004, DrKW concluded the sale of a
participation in Cesa, the fourth largest wind
energy developer, to Bridgepoint Capital.
 Vestas merger with NEG Micon was also
advised by DrKW. Both companies are wind turbine manufacturers. The merger confirmed the
new group has the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world. The transaction size was
500 million euros.
A boost in energy efficiency could create a winwin solution that both helps improve the economic competitiveness of energy-intensive companies and offers investment opportunities for
banks. According to the WWF, the EU Directive
on Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services  if adequately implemented  could bring a
net economic gain for the entire EU economy of
approximately 10 billion euros per year.
Energy efficiency activities are taking on a
new strategic importance for energy intensive
companies. Investments in energy efficiency
projects also offer new opportunities for banks 
5 FINANCING LOW-CARBON ENERGY
the first players have already started to develop
new products in this respect:
 According to CDP, Dexia is developing an
Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction
Fund. Italian Sanpaolo IMI is also working on
the structuring of funds dedicated to energy
efficiency projects.
 For the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), energy efficiency is a key
issue. The bank systematically screens both
existing and potential projects to identify possible energy savings and  where possible 
facilitates the sale of carbon credits from these
projects.

BANKS SHOULD:
S P E C I F I C A L LY, F U N D M A N A G E R S A N D
 Review and optimize their own carbon risk
management and (further) develop assessment
tools applied to carbon risks and carbon risk
reduction strategies (e.g. by using carbon related economic analysis for sectors or companies
and/or by developing climate change related
risk matrixes).
 Define clear risk requirements for clients
regarding carbon risk reduction and market
strategies (e.g. by discussing rating requirements with clients).
 Define clear requirements for rating agencies
on carbon risk in corporate and sector ratings.
 Foster the development of carbon risk hedging
products e.g. derivatives.
 Facilitate finance for public programs that foster the introduction of low carbon technologies.
 Offer carbon risk advisory services for clients.
 Improve the opportunities of JI/CDM-project
development to generate CO2-reduction certificates for optimizing the cash flow of project
financing.
 In respect of their own operations and on a
voluntary basis adapt frameworks such as the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or guidelines
more specifically based on the emissions inventory of the GHG protocol as an accounting and
reporting standard.
F I N A N C I A L A N A LY S T S S H O U L D :

climate change is impacting their business and
what strategies they can employ to minimize
its risks or maximize opportunities from it. Educate clients about the benefits and processes
being used to incorporate extra-financial issues
in the management of their assets.
 Request and reward external research providers
e.g. brokers to produce consistent, high quality,
long-term research which incorporates extrafinancial issues such as climate change, and
to integrate such issues into their mainstream
analyses and investment decisions with the help
of in-house or external SRI expertise.
 Challenge both buy- and sell-side analysts on
their understanding and incorporation of climate change risks and opportunities in their
investment research and ideas.
 Support the development of climate change
databases and request more consistent information from companies on their climate
change performance.
 Develop innovative investment vehicles that
capitalize on changes in climate change policy
and regulation.

Statement
missions trading is an economically efficient, market-based
instrument that encourages the transition to a more sustainable
economy. We see domestic and regional trading as a positive
first step. International trading schemes, such as the Kyoto Protocol
flexible mechanisms and the European trading regime, offer the
opportunity to capitalise on widely varying emission abatement costs.
The flexible mechanisms are an effective way to reduce emissions at a
lower cost, recognising that their efficiency depends largely on their
design. The financial sector will play an important role in the operation
of this international market and from the perspective of the financial
services sector, we recommend thorough consideration of the following
issues when implementing the emissions trading market.
Purpose
In the first of a series of business-relevant
opinion papers by the UNEP FI Climate

1. Emissions Trading  Political
and market framework
Emissions Trading under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is one of the most
universally supported international environmental agreements to date. Entering into force in March
1994, the convention has been joined by 188 states and the European Community (EC) thus far.
Since 1995, the Parties to the Convention have met annually at the Conference of the Parties, known
as the COP, to monitor progress and discuss issues related to the implementation of the Convention.

During COP 3 in 1997, a substantial extension to the Convention was adopted in Kyoto, Japan 
the Kyoto Protocol  outlining legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments.
The agreement commits developed countries to reduce their GHG emissions by an average of 5%
below 1990 levels by the years 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol will enter into force ninety days
after a minimum of 55 parties (accounting for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2 )
emissions for 1990) deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.
The protocol is breaking new ground with the incorporation of three innovative market
mechanisms  International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM). The three mechanisms are designed to improve the costeffectiveness of climate change mitigation by enabling parties to cut emissions more cheaply
abroad than at home. This is important given that the net effect of mitigation on the atmosphere is
the same regardless of where on the planet the action is taken.
As of November 2003, 119 parties had joined the Kyoto Protocol. Russias outstanding but
anticipated ratification would lift the total percentage of CO2 emissions over the 55% threshold,
bringing the protocol into force.
In preparation for the trading scheme under the Kyoto Protocol, a number of emissions trading
initiatives have already emerged, some on a global and others on a regional scale:
The Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), a voluntary CO2 trading market in the US, started
trading in December 2003.
In July 2003, the European Community (EC) adopted a Directive on establishing a scheme for
mandatory GHG emissions allowance trading within the Community from 2005.
A pilot scheme, the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF), was initiated in 2001 by the World Bank
with the aim of achieving emission reductions within the framework of JI and the CDM. Two
new funds, the BioCarbon Fund (BCF) and the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF)
are also being launched in 2003.
Under International Emissions Trading, industrial countries can trade part of their emissions
budget, known as Assigned Amount Units (AAUs), which will be allocated to the Kyoto Protocol
signatory states. A party with high marginal costs of reduction can acquire emission reductions
from another party with lower costs of reduction. This helps both the buyer and the seller reduce
their emissions at minimal cost. Legislators implement emission reductions by decreasing the
number of certificates available in the market. This provides incentives for companies to invest in
emission abatement technologies. In principle, this trading regime applies to nation states,
although the participation of companies is not entirely excluded.
Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism are project-based mechanisms,
as emission certificates are generated via concrete emission reduction projects. Under JI, an
industrialised country invests in emission reduction projects in another industrialised or
transformation country and receives credits for achieved emission reductions - the Emission
Reduction Units (ERUs). Under the CDM, an industrialised country invests in projects in a
developing country and obtains credits for achieved emission reductions called Certified
Emission Reduction Units (CERs). ERUs and CERs can be used as equivalents to AAUs towards
compliance with the reduction target of the Kyoto Protocol. Useful link: http://unfccc.int
UNEP FI  Emissions Trading
The Netherlands initiated two national tender programmes in 2001 to purchase CO2 certificates
from JI and CDM projects (ERUPT/CERUPT).
Since 2001, Denmark and the UK have both initiated domestic trading schemes.
A domestic emissions trading scheme for sulphur dioxide, the Acid Rain Program, was
established in 1990 in the US.
New national tender programmes to purchase CO2 are being launched, or being considered by
other governments in Europe (e.g. Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden etc.).
Canada and Japan are considering putting in place domestic emissions trading schemes.
From 2008, international emissions trading should be possible under the Kyoto Protocol.
Against this background, the international market for GHG emission certificates is still highly
fragmented, but will become more homogenous when the Kyoto Protocol enters into force. Of all
the current initiatives, the ECs proposed scheme, due to start in 2005, is the most ambitious and
will create the worlds largest CO2 market.

Emissions Trading in the European Community
Commencing 1 January 2005, large energy-using sites in selected industries in the EC and their
accession countries will have to limit their emissions of GHGs (most notably CO2) to allocated
levels. The first commitment period will be between 2005 and 2007 and the second period will run
from 2008 to 2012. Emissions trading will create an economically efficient and ecologically
effective way of fulfilling the EC countries reduction targets established by the Kyoto Protocol.
The principles underlying the EC emissions trading system are simple:
Companies within targeted sectors will be allocated permits and at the end of each year must
hold sufficient allowances  the so called EU allowances (EUAs)  to cover their permits.
Companies reducing emissions in affected plants to below the annually allocated emissions
budget can sell their excess EUAs to companies requiring additional certificates.
Companies emitting GHGs without permission are subject to sanctions. During the first
commitment period, the EU member states will apply an excess emissions penalty of  40 for
each tonne of CO2 emitted by that installation for which the operator has not surrendered
allowances. From 2008 onwards, the penalty will be  100 per tonne. Payment of the excess
emissions penalty will not however, release the operator from the obligation to surrender those
allowances representing excess emissions in relation to the following calendar year.
UNEP FI  Emissions Trading
According to the European Commission, some 1,200 million tonnes of CO2 will be included in the
system throughout Europe, corresponding to approximately 46% of the Communitys 2010 CO2
emissions.
Who is affected and what are the risks?
Those sectors and installations affected by the Directive are highlighted in the table below. Some
12,000 European installations will have clearly defined limits for their CO2 emissions.

As early as March 2004, the member states governments must present national allocation plans
which will determine the participating companies initial emission budgets.
Carbon risk management for companies
Against this background, all companies participating in the scheme should realise that CO2 risk
management will emerge as an important factor in their decision-making. The most important risk
categories for individual companies resulting from emission reduction targets are:
cash flow risks, such as increased expenditure on measures aimed at reducing CO2 or the
purchase of emission allowances;
market perception risks which may influence market capitalisation; and
capital cost risks, such as more stringent credit conditions as a result of altered credit risk
ratings. The drawing up of emission inventories and measures taken to increase energy
efficiency will, in future, play important roles in the financial rating process.
To understand their potential carbon risks, companies should have in place a robust and accurate
GHG inventory which details past, current, and projected future emissions. They should
understand the marginal abatement cost options available from different GHG mitigation strategies
and they should understand the tools that are available to achieve compliance within different
GHG regulatory regimes.
Financial services providers can assist companies in managing these effects, and in particular,
reducing the transaction costs of trading by offering new products and services.

2.Risk management tools from
the banking perspective
Offering new products and services to reduce the risk of emissions trading for corporate customers
is a new business challenge for banks. Furthermore, banks usually hold stakes in the companies
affected by trading. Consequently, the risks and opportunities for those companies are also risks
and opportunities for the banks. The complexity of emissions trading requires a wide range of
products and services that effectively hedge against risks emerging from the Kyoto Protocol
and the European trading scheme.
Most importantly, various types of derivatives can be used, such as:
forwards: the purchase of emission allowances to be supplied in the future at a fixed price 
currently the most common type of market-traded allowance;
options: a guarantee of the right to purchase or sell allowances at a fixed price within a defined
period of time; and
swaps: the exchange of payment obligations so that different allowance currencies can be
exchanged.
The market for EUAs, traded on a forward basis, has already started to emerge in 2003. Current
market estimates indicate a steep rise in traded EUA volumes in future years.

Besides derivatives trading, banks can offer the service of EUA portfolio management while taking
over the responsibility of their clients EUA accounts. The most striking advantage of such a service
is that it is not necessary to set up internal expertise in the affected companies, thus resulting in
lower transaction costs.
Emissions trading also offers potential business in the field of project finance  providing project
developers with the chance to generate additional income sources by investing in energy-efficient
technology. This applies to JI and CDM projects, where the inclusion of emission credits in the
analysis of a projects credit quality could become imperative. In principle, the securitisation of
these cash flows could either help to reduce the financing needs of a project developer or reduce
the re-financing costs by embedding them into interest rate derivatives. Accordingly, emission
certificates could help plant developers with new financing mechanisms, thereby leading to more
sophisticated structures as the market expands. However, the practical experiences have shown
that there are still many political and technical obstacles to overcome.

3.Risk management tools from
the insurance perspective
The response of the insurance and reinsurance industries to the challenge of providing their clients
with solutions to enable compliance with emissions trading requirements has been gathering pace
over the last few years. A number of the solutions provided are adaptations of classic risk transfer
solutions whilst others break new ground, in some cases blending insurance and financial
products.
Directors and Officers
The financial
sector has a key
role to play in
delivering market
solutions to
climate change.
2002 Study
UNEP FI Climate
Change Working Group
Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance products offer cover to senior executives for their
professional liability as company leaders. As soon as there is a legal obligation to reduce GHG
emissions, new liabilities are likely to be faced by companies and their top executives. Whilst fines
or penalties resulting from a breach of law would not be covered under a D&O policy,
inappropriate or inadequate management of climate risks, resulting in a failure to protect a
companys interests, could potentially lead to proceedings being taken against senior decisionmakers. A possible cause for action could arise if shareholder value was perceived as being
damaged due to such a failure of management.
Professional Indemnity
As part of the process of creating emission certificates, a pivotal contribution will be made by those
who verify that certificates meet the required standards. Those conducting validation, verification
and certification work, such as auditing organisations, will carry additional responsibilities. These
roles will require professional indemnity policies to cover the new areas of practice.
Project Finance
The focus of many emission reduction activities will most likely be project-based. Therefore,
project finance, whether offered by the banking, insurance or reinsurance industries, offers new
opportunities when applied to projects aimed at reducing emissions (and clean energy in general).
By reducing the risks associated with emission reduction schemes through such tools as carbon
delivery guarantees, contingent guarantees and traditional insurance products (e.g. fire,
engineering and construction coverage for the projects themselves), a number of benefits should
logically follow, including increased project investment ratings, reduced financing costs and
improved return on equity.
Delivery Guarantee
Delivery guarantees are products offered by the insurance industry where the re/insurer acts as
guarantor and financial compensation is paid if a product is not delivered according to agreed
terms and conditions. This system can be used as a facilitator leading up to, and in the early years
of, an emissions trading scheme. It is likely that instead of a monetary amount, the re/insurer of a
project failing to deliver CERs would pay compensation in the form of CERs.
An example of this could be as follows: to ensure future compliance with its emissions ceiling, a
buyer has the option to buy CERs in advance directly from a seller. After locating a seller, the buyer
agrees to purchase a specified number of CERs. In the early stages of any new market system,
there is a higher degree of uncertainty, especially if the production time (order to delivery) is
extended over several years. It is therefore likely that, due to a potential risk of non-delivery, the
seller is required to reserve a larger quantity of CERs for the buyer than the buyer requires.
This gives the buyer a buffer to increase the probability that the quantity of CERs it requires will
indeed be delivered.
Alternatively, the re/insurer with contacts to CER sellers agrees to purchase a large quantity of
credits from various sellers. Having done this, the re/insurer would then guarantee delivery to
various buyers. This reduces the risk of failure of delivery and removes the need for the buyer to
locate suitable sellers. Through this process, both buyer and seller benefit as the risk associated
with the transaction is reduced and the important element of confidence is added to the system.
In addition to delivery guarantees, the risk of non-delivery can also be covered by other risk
management tools such as extension of trade and investment insurance.
UNEP FI  Emissions Trading
Furthermore, it is likely that additional risk transfer and finance solutions will be required in the
future. For example, the area of business interruption has not yet been widely discussed. A seller
of CERs may wish to protect itself from a financial loss following its inability to deliver the CERs
because of an unforeseen event such as a fire. Equally, the buyer of CERs may require a
contingency business interruption cover to protect itself should it suffer a financial loss due to the
supplier being unable to provide the CERs. Although the concept remains the same as
conventional business interruption insurance, the best approach to this product, in relation to the
requirements of emissions trading, needs to be discussed within the industry and its clients.
4.Beyond compliance  GHG
neutral products and services
The emergence of carbon markets is leading to new opportunities for financial institutions beyond
that of emissions trading. Looking at current trends, there is evidence that consumer choice is
being affected by companies attitudes towards the issue of climate change. Offering GHG neutral
products and services is a way to capitalise on these trends.
One way to offer GHG neutral products is for a company, community or individual to offset
emissions in order to help achieve an overall GHG neutral situation. For example, goods, raw
materials and services could be delivered to a company carbon neutral. A similar approach can be
taken with the provision of services. For example, a growing number of conferences and other
events are being promoted as GHG neutral. On a private individual level, consumers may be
offered the choice of buying their day to day goods in a verfied carbon neutral format, thus
offering new product opportunities for producers.
So what is the basic idea of GHG neutral products and services? Prior to delivery, a supplier would
offset the GHGs attributable to its products through the payment of a fee or contribution.
The financial institution, acting as an independent asset manager, would take these contributions
and use its experience in risk management and project finance to invest in GHG-offsetting and
mitigation projects. Examples of projects could include those focusing on renewable energy or
energy efficiency. The products would then be delivered to consumers and other businesses as off
the shelf GHG neutral products. This would also assist downstream businesses by reducing or
eliminating the amount of active offsetting they would need to conduct themselves.
There is evidence of the willingness of consumers to pay an additional fee for products which are
GHG neutral.

The Clean Development Mechanism:
The Financial Sector Perspective
CCWG Statement
The Kyoto Protocols Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a unique
instrument in international climate policy. It supports the implementation
of sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies in developing
countries, and helps industrialised countries meet their emission reduction
obligations in a cost-effective way. The potential market size for Certified
Emission Reductions (CERs) from CDM projects is remarkable: according
to the European Union, an estimated annual 430 million tons of CO2 must
be reduced worldwide in order to meet the Kyoto Protocols emission
reduction targets. It is hoped that a significant share of this volume will
come from CDM projects. This will require, however, significant financial
resources. The financial sector is often asked to play an important role in
this respect, and, in particular, to provide project financing and/or
insurance for CDM projects.
Purpose
This study is the fourth in a series of reports by
the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG)
of the UNEP Finance Initiative. The first was a
scene-setting paper on the risk of climate
change in 2002. The second paper (2003)
In practical terms, the efficiency of the CDM depends largely on its design.
Although the potential market for CERs exists, the current appetite for
private banks and insurers to become engaged in projects is rather low.
At present, the activities in the CDM market are dominated by multilateral
institutions (e.g. World Bank) and national governments, which have to
meet different risk/return requirements compared to private players.
Clearly, the low level of private engagement is due to the specific risk
structure of CDM projects, various institutional barriers, and the
complexity when implementing a CDM project.
confirmed the sectors support for emissions
trading as a key financial tool. The third paper
presented the business case for financing
renewable energy and made policy
recommendations for further action
on the issue.
This fourth paper focuses on the Clean
Development Mechanism and pinpoints
barriers to implementation and financing of
 Neg-Micon
CDM projects as seen from the financial sector
perspective. Recommendations on how these
barriers can be overcome are provided.
How can these barriers be overcome?
UNEP FIs CCWG recommends thorough consideration of four key issues:
 Simplify, standardise and streamline the CDM process: in order
to attract more financial institutions, a faster, more efficient and more
user-friendly project registration process must be in place;
 Provide prompt and clear guidance on the CDM regulations
beyond 2012: without a clear long-term framework for the CDM, it
will be difficult to attract financial institutions to CDM projects;
 Foster the development of institutional CDM capacities in both
host and investor countries;
 Rethink the interpretation of additionality: the current
methodology used for additionality assessment often deters private
financial institutions from engaging in the CDM.
Climate change: Financial instruments and markets
Human induced climate change poses major risks not only to our environment and human health,
but also to our economic systems. According to Munich Reinsurance, the frequency and cost of
global natural disasters is increasing - to more than $60 billion in 2003, a quarter of which was
insured. These challenges have to be dealt with. On the one hand, financial institutions have
developed various risk transfer mechanisms that mitigate the financial risks of climate change for
their clients and themselves, such as weather derivatives and catastrophe bonds (see box 1).
On the other hand, there are numerous markets addressing policy regulations on a variety of
environmental and climate change issues including acid rain from sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
or ozone pollution from nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the US. Also new markets are developing
involving green power products such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which foster the
development of renewable energies in a cost-efficient way. More importantly, the global market for
greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol offers significant opportunities for financial
institutions. The Kyoto Protocol is breaking new ground with the incorporation of three innovative
market mechanisms  International Emissions Trading, and the two project-based mechanisms
Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

The Gold
Standard (GS)
The GS is a high quality
standard for CDM and
JI projects. It has been
developed by the
World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) in
consultation with a
range of
environmental,
business and
governmental
organisations. The GS
is intended to ensure
an even higher level of
environmental, social
and economic benefits
for the host country
than required by the
CDM Executive Board.
The Gold Standard is
now being managed
by BASE, a UNEP
Collaborating Centre
and partner in UNEP's
Sustainable Energy
Finance Initiative.
Weather derivatives
Catastrophe bonds
For weather-dependent business, weather can
negatively impact revenues or increase
inventory costs. This is especially important in
times of a constantly warming climate and an
increasing number of extreme weather events.
The use of weather derivatives can help to
reduce the impact that adverse weather may
have on a company's bottom line. A classic
weather derivative would be a protection
against warm winters for a power company.
These are designed to transfer exposures taken
on by insurance/reinsurance companies to
capital market investors. They usually pay
investors above average yields, unless the
reference catastrophe occurs  in which case
investors lose their coupon and/or principal.
Catastrophe bonds are used to diversify large
portfolios of different assets.
The case for the Clean Development Mechanism
The CDM was established by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. Under the CDM, an industrialised
country invests in projects in a developing country and obtains credits for achieved emission
reductions called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). The CDM is intended to provide specific
benefits for developing countries, including transfer of clean technology, foreign direct investment,
localised environmental improvement and an income stream from the sale of tradable CERs. It is
also intended to attract private sector involvement through investments in CDM projects from
industrialised countries aimed at generating CERs. Through this, the CDM assists industrialised
countries in achieving cost-effective compliance with their quantified emission limitations and
reduction commitments under Kyoto Protocols Article 3.
After protracted political negotiations on the actual design of the mechanism, the CDM is finally up
and running. The 2001 Marrakesh Accords are the most important legal foundation of the CDM
regulations. Since the decision on linking the EU Emissions Trading Scheme with the Kyoto
Protocols project-based mechanisms in 2004, the CDM is widely recognized as a potentially costeffective tool to comply with the Kyoto Protocols emission reduction obligations. Consequently, at
the CDM Executive Board  the formal governance body to oversee the implementation and
administration of the CDM  the pipeline of projects waiting for formal approval under the CDM is
continually growing.
The benefits of CDM projects will depend not only on the overall level of investment, but also on
the nature of the projects, their economic, social and environmental benefits and the extent to
which they generate spill-overs and learning in developing countries. Against this background,
even a market for premium (Gold Standard) CERs is about to develop.
Getting the CDM into gear will require financial resources. The financial sector can play an important role in this respect, and, in particular, provide project financing, lending and insurance for
CDM projects. However, the current involvement of private financial institutions in CDM projects is
rather low. There are various reasons for this, which are addressed in the following paragraphs.

CDM: The fundamentals
Registering a project under the CDM is a long and complex process, requiring a number of
additional steps compared to conventional projects (see box 2). A range of new organisations,
both at the international and the national levels, has to be involved (e.g. Designated National
Authorities and Designated Operational Entities), and a project design document must be
developed including a baseline methodology and a monitoring plan. For a CDM project financer
or insurer it is important to note that the transaction costs for the additional CDM procedures are
often between $50,000 to 250,000 depending on the project type and size. Based on recent
experience, it takes approximately 1 to 3 years to get from the project idea stage to the actual
registration of the project. In addition, the future of the CDM is unclear, as there is no decision yet
on CDM regulations beyond the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period from 2008-2012.
To ensure the environmental integrity of the CDM, the concept of additionality was developed.
Additionality was defined under the Marrakesh Accords as the following:
A CDM project activity is additional if anthropogenic emissions of Greenhouse Gases by
sources are reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the registered
CDM Project activity. (CDM Modalities of Marrakesh Accords)
As part of a projects additionality assessment, the project developer must pass either the investment analysis or the so-called barrier analysis. Here, the project developer must give evidence that
without the CDM the project was not the most plausible economic option or that specific project
implementation barriers can be overcome through registration as a CDM project. Despite this
challenge, an increasing number of players  especially multilateral institutions and national
governments  are getting involved in the CDM helping the CDM market to mature.

CER market and project types
CERs obtained during the period from the year 2000 up to the beginning of the Kyoto Protocols
first commitment period (2008-2012) can be used to achieve compliance in this period. This is why
a rapidly growing volume of certificates has already been traded. According to the World Bank,
almost 61 million tons of project-based carbon certificates for compliance purposes changed hands
in the first half of 2004. For the whole of 2003, the figure was 78 million tons, meaning that the
traded volumes are likely to double in 2004 for the second successive year. Two projects involving
the destruction of Hydrofluorocarbon23 (HFC23)  a very potent greenhouse gas  account for
31% of the entire volume (see box 3).
On the supply side, projects from Asia dominate the market (51%), followed by Latin America
(27%), while Africa represents just 5% of the project volume. The demand side of the CER market is
currently highly concentrated, with Japan, the World Bank and the Dutch government accounting
for approximately 90% of purchases. An increasing number of public players are developing
carbon funds in order to fulfil their reduction requirements under the Kyoto Protocol, e.g.
Germany, Spain, Austria and Italy. According to Resources for the Future, more than 1,000 projects
with an average size of 400,000 tons CO2 equivalents reduction annually need to be approved by
the CDM Executive Board in order to meet the expected demand. It seems difficult to imagine that

the Board could approve that many projects by 2010  the future demand for CERs could be much
higher than supply.
The current CER price range is between  3 and 10 per ton, depending on which stage of the CDM
project cycle the certificates have been sold at. As with any commercial financial transaction, the
higher the risk involved in purchasing CERs, the lower the CER price. Moreover, the ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Parliament in October 2004 and the EU Linking Directive that
allows CERs to be used within the EU Emissions Trading market will become important CER price
drivers in the future.

CDM benefits and risks: a financial sector perspective
The CDM has the potential to generate many benefits for project developers and the environment.
For the project developer and the investor, the sale of CERs can secure an additional income
stream for the project. Furthermore, the development of an Emission Reduction Purchase
Agreement (ERPA) leads to additional scrutiny and risk assessment of the project. Although these

Box 5: CDM Project Risks
Type of risk
Description
Conventional
project
risks
Risks that are common to all projects in developing and
industrialised countries, e.g.:
 exceeding costs: e.g. the employed technology needs costly
repairs or the construction of the project is delayed
 market risks: e.g. relevant fuel prices increase and the project is no longer
economically efficient
 counterparty credit risk: e.g. risk that the technology provider becomes
insolvent
 underperformance: e.g. non-achievement of design standard efficiency
 currency risk: e.g. high inflation levels
 force majeur: an event beyond the control of the involved parties, e.g.
earthquake, terrorism attack
Host country
political
risks
From a financial sector perspective, projects in developing countries are usually
regarded with a higher level of risk than projects in the industrialised world because
of the often less developed legal and political infrastructure, e.g.:
 risk of confiscation, expropriation and nationalisation of the CDM projects
 (civil) war risk: e.g. risk of riot, strike and civil commotion within the CDM host
country
 contract repudiation/frustration: risk that a contract is rendered invalid e.g.
by a parliament introducing new legislation
 credit risk: in particular risk of host country insolvency
 further administrative barriers: e.g. host country requires various
administrative procedures that delay the project
process
risks
Risks that are specific to the generation and sale of CERs, e.g.:
 CDM Executive Board non-approval: e.g. no registration of the project
by the Executive Board or an already approved methodology is withdrawn
by the Executive Board
 CDM risk: there is no CDM beyond 2012
 monitoring/verification risk: e.g. inaccurate monitoring by the Designated
Operational Entity
 public consultation risk: non-acceptance of the project by NGOs or local
communities
 institutional barriers: e.g. the host countrys Designated National Authority is
not fully established and not working cooperatively with the investor
 CER legal ownership: unclear about who is the legal owner of the CERs

advantages are relatively obvious and the CDM market is now more dynamic than ever, there are
still numerous risks and barriers to be considered by financial institutions before engaging in a
CDM project. Analysing these risks and barriers is even more important considering that the CDM
is a very new and complex mechanism and that CDM projects naturally include investments in
developing countries, where further external parameters could jeopardize the economic success of
the project. For a financial institution, getting engaged in any type of project is always a question of
how to identify, allocate and assign the project risks. The main risk categories of a CDM project can
be categorised as conventional project risks common to all projects, host country political risks
and additional specific CDM process risks (see box 5).
Generally, financial institutions and investors are used to dealing with the first two risk categories.
However, the fact that political risks are well known to financial institutions does not automatically
mean that such risks can easily be dealt with. Among developing countries, circumstances vary
hugely. Often a developing countrys political and legal infrastructure is less transparent than in an
industrialised country with the result of political instability or a lower creditworthiness, for
example. Financial institutions have to set up restrictions for loans in countries where political and
economic risks are higher. Therefore, lenders usually set limits on loan volumes and often
restrictions are imposed on longer-term transactions.
In principle, host country political risks can be dealt with through the acquisition of insurance from
reinsurance companies, development banks or export credit agencies. Insurance premiums must
be directly related to the risks involved. Regarding conventional project risks, a promising way to
mitigate the risk of a shortfall of credits, for example, would be to impose strong penalties for nondelivery of the CERs or to buy non-delivery insurance. It is important to thoroughly draft the
Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement in order to mitigate the risks. CDM process risks are new
to financial institutions and can be complex. They require a detailed understanding of the political
and legal framework of the CDM, and, for European players, also of the EU Emissions Trading
regime and its link to the CDM. There are only a few CDM experts available in the financial sector
UNEP FI  Finance for Carbon Solutions
at present, hampered further by a limited history of how to mitigate CDM process risks and which
strategies to employ successfully.
Further barriers to project implementation and financing
Besides the risk categories outlined above there are other institutional CDM specific risks that pose
barriers to CDM project implementation and financing.
Firstly, the CDM process is rather long and often perceived to be inefficient. The CDM registration
process is bureaucratic with numerous layers of outside intervention, protracted decision making,
review, and options to appeal. There is no doubt about the need for strong and environmentally
credible rules to govern the CDM process, but the complexity of the current process serves to
obstruct the development of beneficial CDM projects for developing and industrialised countries.
Secondly, the heavy and steadily increasing workload of the CDM Executive Board is obviously
problematic. The relatively few resources of the Board to review and approve CDM projects and
the currently limited number of accredited Designated Operational Entities to validate the projects
for registration and verify/certify the emission reductions are limiting factors for further CDM
project development. These contribute to the long time horizons to develop a CDM project.
Thirdly, there is a lack of institutional capacity both in host and buyer countries. Although more
than sixty Designated National Authorities exist, in many cases the resources available to these
Authorities are not sufficient to provide a user-friendly CDM infrastructure. For example, it is often
difficult to obtain the important host country approval for the project or there may be a lack of
clarity regarding the host countrys sustainability criteria which leads to additional delay.
Fourthly, the projects additionality is often a problematic issue. Clearly, additionality is central to
the environmental integrity of the CDM and there has been intense debate about how additionality
(according to Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol) should be tested. However, a project developer
who seeks to ensure financing for a project faces a dilemma: within its investment analysis, the
CDM Executive Boards decision on Tools for Demonstration of Additionality asks for
determination that without the registration as a CDM project, the project activity is not the most
economically or financially attractive. This often deters private financial institutions from engaging
in the CDM. For an investor, it is important that the project is financially robust in itself, so that the
CDM is not the only factor fuelling the project. Few commercial projects are undertaken for one
specific reason. Given the CDM risks, it is unlikely that a financial sector institution will undertake
a project for CDM reasons alone.
As an alternative to the investment analysis, the Executive Board proposes a barrier analysis to
prove a CDM projects additionality. However, the Board must provide more transparency and
clarity on the type of evidence that can be accepted to pass the barrier analysis. Otherwise, the risk
of failure at the project approval stage will be very difficult to calculate for the involved project
Box 6: Financial solutions for CDM projects in practice
Case study: Carbon Delivery Guarantee
Various research has been conducted by the financial sector to develop insurance and non-insurance
risk management instruments for the greenhouse gas market as a whole and CDM projects in particular.
There is obvious demand from project developers, investors and buyers of CERs for risk mitigating tools
for CDM projects. UNEP FI signatory Garant, Global Sustainable Development Project (GSDP) and Swiss
Re Greenhouse Gas Risk Solutions are trying to meet this demand with the launch of the first carbon
delivery guarantee insurance in late 2004. A carbon delivery guarantee is an insurance product where the
re/insurer acts as guarantor for future CER delivery, and financial compensation is paid in case CERs are
not delivered according to agreed terms and conditions. The carbon delivery guarantee is shaped to
meet the CER buyers demand for risk mitigation.
One of the first carbon delivery guarantees will be applied to CERs generated by a reduction project in
South America, which utilizes an innovative proprietary filter technology. In total, the project consists of
1,000,000 tons CERs. The seller will deliver CERs annually from 2005 to 2007 and the carbon delivery
guarantee is based on a purchase price of $5 per CER. The insurance covers carbon delivery guarantee
designed as contract frustration*, political risk insurance (incl. host industry insolvency, seller insolvency,
political and country risk) and business interruption.
*Contract frustration insurance protects against losses arising from the host government's breach or
repudiation of a contract with the investor. If, after a specified period of time, the investor has not received
payment or if the dispute resolution mechanism fails to function because of actions taken by the host
government, the insurer will pay compensation.

participants. To ensure the success of the CDM, additionality should be interpreted in such a way
as to ensure both environmental and economic efficiency of the CDM (see recommendations).
Such an interpretation does not jeopardize the environmental integrity of the CDM. On the
contrary, it increases the environmental integrity as it will stimulate global greenhouse gas
emission reduction activities. Additionality tests should focus on whether an emission reduction
activity has real, measurable and long-term benefits related to the mitigation of climate change
and not on whether the potential profits from the CDM are the driving factor behind the
emission reductions.
Recommendations:
How can the CDM process be improved?
In order to improve the CDMs economic efficiency without abandoning its environmental
integrity, UNEP FIs Climate Change Working Group makes the following recommendations:
Simplify, standardize and streamline the CDM process: In order to attract financial
institutions, a faster and more user-friendly process must be in place. The private players that
are supposed to utilize the CDM require further process standardisation, e.g. more Designated
Operational Entities need to be accredited and more methodologies must be approved
promptly in order to attract more CDM players, particularly from the financial sector.
Provide prompt and clear guidance on the CDM regulations beyond 2012: With no
second commitment period in place, the window for CDM project development is closing
rapidly. The interest for CERs generated beyond 2012 is very limited and prices are low.
Without a clear long-term framework for the CDM, it will be difficult to attract the involvement
of financial institutions.
Foster the development of institutional CDM capacities in host and investor
countries: In many cases the necessary national CDM institutions are either underdeveloped
or non-existent. A faster and more efficient CDM process requires clear procedures to be
followed by the project participants in both host and investor countries. The parties to the
Kyoto Protocol should foster the development of national CDM capacities in order to enhance
the investment climate for the CDM.
Rethink the interpretation of additionality: The concept of suboptimal efficiency seems
counter-intuitive and is often perceived as an obstacle by the finance sector. One possible way
out of this dilemma  while maintaining core elements like monitoring and verification  would
be to take on a sector-wide approach rather than a project-based approach. A promising option
for consideration by the Parties to the UNFCCC is to establish carbon efficiency standards for
developing countries in their most carbon-intensive sectors. Any project that would perform
better than that standard should be considered a CDM project, contributing to the reduction of
carbon emissions in that particular sector.

Conclusion
The CDM has the potential to become a powerful tool in reducing global greenhouse gas
emissions. This potential will only materialize if the economic efficiency of the CDM increases
substantially. The CDM is still in the early development stage with various teething troubles that
pose barriers to its wider breakthrough among the business and finance communities. The CDM is
currently a mechanism with high transaction costs and relatively low overall efficiency. The
specific CDM risks in combination with the institutional barriers to CDM project implementation
and financing are deterring many financial institutions from getting involved in CDM projects.
The key challenges for the UNFCCC Secretariat in the near future are to streamline and standardise
the approval process and to register successful CDM projects. The CDM Executive Board might
need additional resources to meet these requirements if the volume of project throughput increases.
The CDM was designed to engage the private sector in climate change adaptation and mitigation in
the developing world. In order for this to happen, the CDM process must become clearer, more
efficient and financially attractive. A significant and positive step in this direction is the
implementation of the recommendations presented in this briefing. If these issues are not
addressed, and major improvements not made, then the success of the CDM may be compromised,
and, potentially, the entire Kyoto process may suffer.

Purpose
This study is the fifth in a series of briefings to policy-makers and financial institutions by
the Climate Change Working Group of the UNEP Finance Initiative.
This paper addresses the potential benefits and pitfalls of the international climate regime
beyond 2012 from a financial sector perspective, and provides recommendations on how
international climate policy should develop up to 2012 and beyond.

Summary and recommendations
The evidence is overwhelming  human-induced climate
change is real, and the environmental, economic and
social costs due to inaction against this threat are
already high and are likely to be much higher in future.
Climate change costs will vary widely from region to
region and from sector to sector leaving the developing
world with the largest negative consequences.
The Kyoto Protocol is the start of an inevitable
transition to a low-carbon economy. There is an urgent
need now to extend this framework beyond 2012, as a
key part of a global policy regime, in order to foster
investments in low and non-carbon technologies.
A stable, long-term regulatory framework, which can
enhance and develop a global carbon market, and,
more importantly, the broader investment environment,
is necessary to meet long-term environmental targets.
Aligning environmental objectives and investment
horizons will require clear signals to the finance and
business communities, both through the emergence
of a carbon price and other policy signals providing
clarity on climate policy for medium- and long-term
corporate investment decisions.

international and national climate
policy regulations beyond 2012.

The CCWG believes that the Kyoto

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
According to the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2002 Reference scenario which takes into account
government policies and measures on climate change and energy security that had been adopted by
mid-2002, CO2 emissions will increase by 1.8 per cent per year from 2000 to 2030. From 12,369 Mt
of CO2 equivalent in 2000, emissions will reach 16,397 Mt in 2030 for OECD countries  an average
increase of 0.9 per cent per year. The power generation sector will contribute to almost half the
increase in global emissions between 2000 and 2030 and will remain the single biggest CO2-emitting
sector in 2030. In OECD countries, its share will rise from 38 per cent in 2000 (4,725 Mt of CO2) to
40 per cent in 2030 (6,524 Mt of CO2).
Today, power generation emits 65 per cent of industrial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in OECD
countries and is likely to become instrumental in countries strategies to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The European Union has decided to introduce a CO2 emission trading scheme, with a pilot
phase to run between 2005-2007, and a second phase running from 2008-2012 to coincide with the
first Kyoto Protocol commitment period. The scheme will cover CO2 emissions from all combustion
plant with a rated thermal input of >20MW capacity (including the power sector), as well as from the
metals, minerals and paper/pulp industries.
The introduction of emission allowances will alter operating costs in the power generation sector, and
is expected to have an influence on the operation of existing generating capacity as well as the
composition of future investment. While emissions trading and GHG emissions limits therefore pose
a new form of regulatory challenge, these effects should be seen in the context of electricity markets
that are currently characterised by rapid regulatory changes and new market arrangements that have
already altered the power generation sector significantly over the past decade.
The purpose of this study is to explore how investment decisions in the power generation sector may
be modified with the introduction of CO2 emission allowances. To do so, it considers, through a
simplified quantitative analysis, power plant costs, operation and investment changes in the electricity
generation over both short-run and long-run timescales. The model results should not be considered
as projections but rather as a tool to explore the potential impacts of a greenhouse emission trading
scheme on investments. The effects of a CO2 price are based on the power plants assumptions on an
aggregate level and do not include plant specificities. In reality, details in plant economics will
deviate. This will, therefore, smooth out the results found in this paper. The magnitude of the
variables considered in this paper is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Therefore, the quantitative
conclusions should be taken as an indication of the scale of potential effects.
The first chapter concentrates on the short term impact of a carbon emission cap and price effects, and
the way power plants operating costs may change. The results show that there can be a switch in
competitiveness between combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) and coal plant due to the introduction
of a CO2 price if it reaches a certain level. This is because coal plants emit more than twice the
amount of CO2 than CCGT plants to produce one kWh. The level at which these switches start to take

place is estimated to be around 19 per tonne of CO2, however, changes are likely to occur at lower
levels as well as higher levels, depending on plant specificities.
The impact on wholesale power prices is an important factor, affecting not only the competitiveness
of EU electricity users, but also having implications for investment levels and competitiveness in the
power sector itself. The extent to which carbon intensive power plants pass through their CO2 costs to
wholesale markets will depend both on the price-setting behaviour within the electricity market, and
also to some extent on the allocation methods that are currently being developed by EU member
states.
The second chapter focuses on the longer-term impacts of emissions trading on investment decisions.
The analysis focuses on the effects on competitiveness for a range of generating technologies at
different CO2 prices. CCGT plants are used as the reference since this technology offers lower
economic risks and investments than other technologies.
The main conclusions of the report are presented below.
Implications for Plant Operation
The carbon emission allowance will increase the variable costs for fossil-fuelled power
plants and thus its short-run marginal costs since an emission allowance will be needed for
each unit of CO2 produced. Coal-fired generation will be more strongly affected than gas-fired
generation because of the higher (approximately double) carbon emission per unit of output.
The CO2 emission price which makes CCGT and coal plants equal in terms of short-run
marginal costs (the breakeven price) is estimated around 19 per tonne of CO2. Below this
price, coal plants appear to be more competitive. Above this price, CCGT plants seem more
competitive2.
Starting from a price of around 19 per tonne of CO2, there appears to be a significant change
in the electricity market merit order due to a reverse in the competitiveness based on short-run
marginal cost of coal and combined cycle gas turbine plants.
The sensitivity of this breakeven3 price to changes in the underlying assumptions is high. For
example, a 53 per cent increase compared to the baseline gas price taken in the model leads to
a 120 per cent increase in the CO2 breakeven price (rising from 19 to 34 per tonne of CO2).
Likewise, the sensitivity of the breakeven price to assumptions about plant efficiencies is even
higher. If the CCGT plants efficiency increases from 49 per cent to 62 per cent, the rate
forecasted for plants built in 2030, the breakeven price falls by 71 per cent.
It is important to note that this result is based on power plants assumptions on an aggregate level and do not
include plant specificities. Therefore, in reality, this breakeven point should be considered as a proxy.
The breakeven price discussed is the CO2 price which makes CCGT and coal plants equal in terms of short-run
marginal cost.
Effects on Power Prices
There is no uniform agreement on the impact of a CO2 emission price on wholesale and retail
electricity prices. A simple economic assessment, based on either auctioned or freely allocated
allowances in a market with power prices set by perfect competition (or without significant
oligopoly), would suggest that carbon prices would be simply passed straight through to
wholesale prices, since CO2 prices will have a real value as an opportunity cost that is treated
directly as part of the short-run marginal costs of production. The price impact would be
determined by the CO2 price and the marginal technology. Noting that the marginal
technology varies according to the hours and months in the year, we could consider that the
variation in electricity demand over a year follows a Normal distribution. In this case,
wholesale electricity prices in Europe would increase by 21 per cent if the CO2 price were 20
per tonne. This, of course, would have a substantial impact on the competitive position of EU
energy-intensive industries that compete in world markets.
However, in practice the way generation costs get passed through to electricity prices will be
complicated by factors such as regulatory pricing mechanisms, competitive pressure, price
elasticity of the demand, and market concentration. In addition, the allocation method can
have an important effect on the price feed-through. If the allocation for the second period
depends on emissions during the first period (so-called up-dating), this creates an incentive
to maintain higher emissions in order to gain additional allowances in the second period4.
Since internal use of the allowance to cover emissions would result in higher future
allocations, the internal value of an allowance would be higher than the market CO2 price.
This would imply that companies would not necessarily pass on the full opportunity costs
directly, and prices might not rise to the extent expected.
Which ever method is used, the initial allocation implies a transfer of wealth within the
economy, and the value of this transfer of wealth depends on these price effects. This wealth
transfer could also have implications for taxation policy, since the distribution of this CO2 cost
should be taken into account when setting any additional CO2 taxes.
Impacts on Power Sector Investment
If CO2 costs were fully passed through to prices, opportunity costs would be fully recovered,
and investment signals for both incumbents and new entrants5 to the market would be
undistorted. That is to say, the introduction of a carbon price would not raise any additional
barriers to overall investment for either capacity expansion or new plant. There would
however, be a tendency towards investment in lower emitting technologies. Full price feedthrough is also efficient from an environmental compliance point of view, since the price rise
would be expected to have some influence on reducing demand, and emissions.
However, as noted above, in practice full recovery of opportunity costs may be unlikely to
happen. In this case, it could be necessary to make arrangements to compensate new entrants
to the market, for example through setting aside a portion of free allowances for them in the
Nevertheless, such updating could be counter-productive, since it in practice will incentivize a player to pollute as
much as possible (as long as there is a positive slope in the CO2-price forward slope).
New entrants are new plants built either by incumbents, either by new generators.
initial allocation. The allocation of free allowances is one way to cover additional investment
risks. The uncertainty concerning the CO2 price and future allocation of allowances, would
drive the investment risk premium and thus make the investment more expensive; and this
would not be reflected in the electricity price. The level of free allowances to new plants,
given that it is an investment incentive, must, however, be very carefully considered. This
would reduce barriers to entry but could complicate the investment signals for incumbents. If
it were too high, it would create a boom-and-bust behaviour in the industry.
If allocation in the second period is based on emissions in the first period, this could reduce
the incentive to make investments in emissions reductions during the first period
(discouraging so-called early-action). Long-term investment decisions will be exposed to
revisions of the national plans. It is not known whether companies would be able to hold the
benefits of investments in emissions reductions investments for several trading periods,
leading to a risk of stranded assets. This uncertainty could delay fuel switching since
companies could want to wait until this uncertainty is resolved. This also includes uncertainty
about the future international climate negotiations.
Prices need to stay in a certain range in order not to have too disruptive an effect on
investment. They must allow a smooth transition to newer and more efficient plants (see
mothballing discussion)
The CO2 price will probably in practice only introduce minor modifications to the choice of
plant technologies to build. In many countries, CCGT is already the technology with the
lowest long-run marginal costs, and since this is a relatively low carbon intensity technology,
investment decisions will continue to be in favour of CCGT plants for companies generation
mix when a CO2 constraint is introduced. If CCGT is compared with non emitting
technologies, the CO2 price has to be in the range of 30 to 200 per tonne of CO2 for
renewable technologies to become competitive6. For most renewable technologies therefore,
other policies need to be enacted to increase renewables market share (e.g. The European
Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the
European Union's internal electricity market).
Carbon emission prices would need to reach approximately 26 per tonne of CO2 for nuclear
power to be as competitive as CCGT (including decommissioning costs). Carbon prices could
therefore contribute to the economic case for retaining nuclear compared to the carbon price
necessary to make wind and biomass technologies as competitive as CCGT plants. This
breakeven price will be sensitive to specific plant costs. For example, the full investment costs
of nuclear power plants in Finland and in France are as low as 22 per MWh compared to the
38.8 per MWh found based on our assumptions. If the investment costs reached the lowest
range, nuclear plants would have no need for a CO2 premium.
At the margins, a carbon constraint will tend to encourage substitution from the use of coal
towards a more intensive use of natural gas as a fuel for electricity generation. Using
illustrative plant operation costs, the report indicates that if allowance prices exceed 23 per
tonne of CO2, it seems more economic for a company to replace its existing coal-fired
Some renewables are, however, already competitive at the lower end of the scale.
capacity with a modern CCGT plant rather than continue running them7. If the CO2 price
ranges between 19 and 23 then companies will need to arbitrage between building a new
CCGT plant or run their existing coal plants. Companies with a range of generating
technologies, particularly low carbon intensity technologies, will be in an advantageous
position to make a strategic response to uncertain carbon prices.
What level of emission reductions would drive such CO2 prices in those ranges is not possible
to assess from the model described in this paper. However, the Boston Consulting Group
assumes that if the European power sector would have to reduce 25 per cent of the total
targeted CO2 reduction (Europes burden under business-as-usual scenario), CO2 prices8
would reach 25 per tonne of CO2. If power generators were to shoulder 50 per cent of the
total reduction, a carbon price would reach 35.
One option for reducing carbon emissions from coal plants is to replace coal by biomass in
existing boilers. In the IPCC methodology, biomass fuels are not included in the CO2
emissions. This is because for CO2 emissions, biomass consumption for fuel is assumed to
equal its regrowth. For each kWh produced by biomass fuel, direct co-combustion reduces the
CO2 emissions in the coal plant by 918g/kWh. Specific additional investment costs reach 6
per tCO2 for 10 per cent co-combustion from biomass energy. However, the potential for cocombustion is not unlimited. The potential replacement depends on many factors: technical
limitations as well as limitations imposed by the authorities, and financial and legal
provisions. Companies can also decide to upgrade their existing coal plant, with estimated
emissions reductions of about 2 per cent available below the 23 per tonne of CO2 threshold.
Second Order Impacts
The presence of a CO2 price will probably accelerate the tendency for gas to become the
preferred fuel in power generation. However, gas production in OECD Europe and North
America is not expected to grow as strongly as gas demand in these regions. With growing
reliance of gas imports, the access to such supply in the long term at attractive conditions is
also crucial. However, increased demand would imply increased prices. Most of the potential
future gas supply is projected to come from sources located in technically challenging and
politically risky environments. The development of new gas supplies and the infrastructure to
deliver the commodity to the market will therefore require substantial investments. If the
necessary investments in infrastructure and supply development were undertaken in order to
secure gas imports, the gas consumers would face the prospect of having to pay significantly
higher gas prices9. This could be another upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.
Another reason why gas prices might increase is related to the way the gas prices are fixed in
long term contracts. Coal and lignite emit twice the amount of CO2 than gas, which gives
additional value to gas. Therefore, because of the new carbon emission constraint, gas
suppliers might be inclined to claim the value attributed to the difference in CO2 emissions
between gas and coal. Gas suppliers might include at least part of this additional CO2 emission
value in their gas contracts, thereby increasing their gas prices.
To calculate this price, closure costs of plants have been ignored.
The BCG assumes that to reach such a reduction in emissions, a minimum CO2 price of 25 per tonne of CO2
would be required. The price could be imposed by issuing a limited number of carbon-emission tradable permits.
Market power on the emission allowances trading market will be limited for several reasons.
First, no generators will hold a significant market share that will allow them to manipulate
prices. If, however, generators agree to act as one entity, then this could block the entry on the
power market. Nevertheless, if they act as a monopoly, they are faced to other sectors since
several other sectors will participate in the emissions trading market. The market is expected
to be sufficiently liquid to prevent actors from manipulating the carbon emission price.
There is a definite link between the development of renewable sources and greenhouse gas
emission reductions. Increased use of renewable power production displaces thermal power
production, which automatically leads to a decrease in the total amount of emissions. Policies
to require a desired percentage of renewable energy will therefore reduce the total emissions
that need to be reduced through other (probably more economic) means.
Conversely, if price support mechanisms for renewables are sensitive to market prices (e.g.,
by using Tradable Renewable Energy Certificates TRECs), the rise in wholesale prices will
reduce the gap between the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of new renewables and the
electricity price. The additional cost of renewables will therefore fall.
The LRMC of renewables could be divided, not only into a spot market price of electricity,
but further into a value of the achieved CO2 reduction by the renewable investment
undertaken and a residual cost associated with achieving the targets for the development of
renewables. To the extent that CO2 costs are internalized into the wholesale electricity price,
the value of a TREC will then represent the additional costs for producing renewables,
excluding the carbon improvement.
Introducing an emissions trading scheme is not expected to adversely impact on overall investments,
although it could change the technology choice for new plants. However, the uncertainty surrounding
the trading market currently seems to cause definite hesitance to invest in the market. As described
above, these unknowns delay investments. In the power sector, plants which are currently built will be
expected to still be operating in 20-30 years. It will not be possible to remove regulatory uncertainties
over these timescales, but a trading market should help to transfer the regulatory risk to a market price
of carbon which should be easier to manage through options, futures, etc. Emission trading provides
additional flexibility to power companies compared to other regulatory measures such as emission
standards. Nevertheless, in the early stages of the carbon market, these risks will be relatively high,
and could affect investments. Whereas it is clear that the risk will be lower once the market has settled
down, the remaining risk should not be underestimated. The fact that there will be ongoing new
allocations and targets mean that investors will only have a short (3-4 years for the first and second
commitment periods) foresight into ETS (which will be the potentially most important value driver)
when they commit themselves to a 20-30 year investment.

called assigned amount), expressed in million tonnes of CO2
equivalent.
Allowances (AAUs)
Also called assigned amount units. Permission to emit one tonne of

INTRODUCTION
Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas provides about three-quarters of the worlds energy .
However, through fuel combustion, the primary man-made or anthropogenic greenhouse gas,
carbon dioxide (CO2), is emitted . Greenhouse gases are now widely recognised as being responsible
for contributing to climate change. Climate change caused by human activities threatens to affect the
climate, health, habitat and economy of virtually all countries. It is one of the most difficult
environmental challenges the world faces today.
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), more than 180
countries have recognised the need to stabilise the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the
atmosphere. Climate stabilisation will require tremendous changes in the way energy is produced and
consumed. The efforts of policy-makers are now focused on minimising the economic and social
costs of changing the production and consumption patterns. Emission trading at an international level
was introduced in the Kyoto Protocol for that purpose . In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol set legallybinding GHG reduction targets for a number of industrialised countries. While implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol still requires efforts from both national administrations and the international
community, several countries and regions have decided to implement emission trading schemes. This
is the case for the European Union (EU) which will start implementing an industry CO2 emission
trading scheme by 2005, and will introduce a cap-and-trade constraint for the first Kyoto Protocol
commitment period (2008-2012).
Power generation represents the bulk of industrial emissions of CO2 in OECD countries . According
to the WEO Reference scenario, it will contribute almost half the increase in global emissions
between 2000 and 2030 and will remain the single biggest CO2-emitting sector in 203014. It is
therefore likely to become instrumental in countries strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
This study attempts to shed light on the consequences for the power generating sector of the
introduction of a carbon emission allowance. The purpose of the paper is to get a better understanding
of possible impacts a CO2 price will have on the economics of this sector and investment decisions
taken by the players in the power generation sector. It outlines some of the main concerns and
decisions that will appear when electricity generating companies are legally bound to a carbon
constraint.
The paper analyses the impact of a carbon emission allowance on the power generators and looks at
its effects in terms of plants competitiveness, and companies investment decisions.
Chapter 1 explains at what CO2 price non carbon intensive technologies will become more competitive
than carbon intensive technologies. It also analyses changes in competitiveness between certain fossil
fuel plants.
Chapter 2 assesses to what degree the introduction of a carbon emission price will modify companies
investment decisions. Table 14 summarises these investment choices in a table.

Resulting from the technology choices discussed above, Chapter 2 also considers second order effects
of a carbon emission constraint. It analyses whether this could have implications on the economics of
other energy sectors, in particular the gas sector. It also examines whether market power could be
exercised on the emission trading market. Finally, it considers the possible links between emission
trading schemes and renewable energy obligations, focusing primarily on the tradable renewable
energy certificate systems.
Whilst many of the conclusions from this paper will be applicable to emissions trading in any country,
many of the examples raised in this paper relate to the EU emission trading scheme. This is used as an
illustration for several reasons. The first reason is that the European Union has moved a step forward
in creating a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme (ETS). Several uncertainties related to rules
governing the future ETS have recently been clarified. Secondly, the regional EU ETS gives a
reasonable illustration of how a future international emission trading market for the private sector
might function. Lastly, Europe as a whole has a relatively balanced generating mix although each
member state has a specific fuel mix on the margin. Therefore, after highlighting the possible impacts
on the market as a whole and stressing which technology is the most likely to be chosen after the
introduction of a carbon emission cost, it is possible to look more in-depth to country specifics.
Details regarding the European Emissions Trading Scheme
On the 2 of July 2003, the European Parliament gave its second-reading approval to the European
Union's carbon dioxide emissions trading scheme. With this, legislative processes advancing the rules
for carbon emissions trading are becoming clearer. The EU negotiators used economic theory at two
levels. First, the EU adopted a bubble approach at Kyoto allowing Member States to agree on how
the overall EU target of  8 per cent in the first commitment period would be allocated by country.
This burden-sharing (see Appendix 5) agreement was designed to reflect equivalence of effort from
Member States actions to reduce GHG emissions. Eight Member States have targets which imply a
reduction in emissions from base year levels (Luxemburg, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark,
Italy, UK and Germany), five countries are allowed increased emissions (Spain, Greece, Portugal,
Ireland and Sweden) and two countries have stabilisation targets (Finland and France). Second, the
European Commission placed emissions trading at the centre of the European approach to
implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
The European Commissions Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) proposal covers two trading periods
(2005-2007 and 2008-2012), the latter being the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
Allowances will be allocated to approximately 18,000 facilities throughout the EU, such as refineries,
power stations (units above 20 MW), paper, pulp, metal and mineral plants. These facilities currently
have a combined emission of 1,680 million tonnes of CO2 per year, amounting to more than 45 per
cent of all energy-related CO2 emissions in the EU. If all Accession Countries states join, it would
increase the volume by 35 per cent, although it should be noted that some of the new members might
apply for a transition period, and thus not take part from the beginning.
Each facility would be allocated tradable emissions allowances by its national government, with one
allowance equal to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. At the end of each compliance year,
each facility would have to hold allowances equal to or greater than the volume of its emissions, or
face a financial penalty of 40 per additional tonne of CO2 in 2005-2007, and 100 per tonne from
2008. Throughout the year, facilities emitting fewer emissions than its target would be able to sell
allowances, while facilities emitting more would have to buy in order to make compliance.
Analysis of the Allocation Modes
Most of the available allowances must be allocated to existing emitters without charge. Member
countries of the EU can choose between different criteria for the distribution: historical emissions or
external benchmarks. In the proposal, updating is not explicitly considered, however, the allocation
plans are for three years at first and five years after that. Therefore, there may not be grandfathering
during both periods. Certain elements of updating could be introduced in the allocation of the second
periods quotas (i.e., if a sector has emission levels that are much lower than anticipated, that may be
reflected in its future allocation, with a lower quantity of allowances. Similarly, a sector with much
higher emissions could argue that its allocation needs to be increased).
The use of auctioning is restricted. During the initial period, Member States can auction up to 5 per
cent of the allowances. In the second period, the level of auctioning may reach 10 per cent. The
European Commission has guaranteed the implementation of a harmonised EU auctioning of
allowances "after 2012". In one of the differences between the Council and Parliament, the Parliament
recommended a mandatory auctioning of 15 per cent of all allowances
New Entrants
According to the EU Directive, Member States have two options keeping in consideration that
national emission quotas have to be respected. In the first case, Member States may choose to let new
entrants buy allowances on the market. Operators of new installations will make investment decisions
with certainty of the need for them to take their climate change impact into account. If a Member
State chooses to let new entrants buy allowances on the market, there is no need to reduce the total
allocated quantities as set in the preceding step to provide for new entrants. In the second option,
Member States could choose to build a reserve of allowances for new entrants. Up to the amount of
allowances in the reserve, new entrants would be given a free allocation.
Links with the Kyoto Mechanisms
The future links between the EU ETS and other emission trading markets are uncertain. It is not clear
whether the EU will open its emissions trading market to other countries. For the moment, what is
clear is that the EU ETS will be open to other countries through the two other flexible mechanisms,
Clean Development Mechanisms and Joint Implementation. However, in the case of the EU ETS,
there may be some limit to the use of CDM and JI credits. A review will be triggered once the
number of credits converted for use in the EU emissions trading scheme reaches 6 per cent of the total
quantity of allowances allocated by the Member States for the 2008-2012 period. The outcome of
such a discussion may, for example, be a quantitative limit of 8 per cent for the remainder of the
Kyoto Period, according to the proposal.
IMPLICATIONS OF CARBON EMISSION COSTS ON MARKET PRICES AND
GENERATION COSTS
The short-run marginal cost represents a floor for electricity prices in liberalised markets. On a daily
or weekly basis, companies will not produce electricity if the market price does not cover their
variable costs of generation. The introduction of a carbon emission allowance ought to be included
in the companies variable costs and thus in its short-term marginal costs (i.e. along with Operating
and Maintenance costs, fuel costs, etc.) since an emission allowance will be needed for each unit of
CO2 produced. The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the magnitude of this carbon cost (as a
percentage of the total cost) following different scenarios for the carbon price and several sensitivity
cases on fuel prices and on plant efficiencies.
Implication of carbon allowances on generation costs
Short-run marginal costs play a key role in cost-based power auctions because they help determine the
competitive price on the market. Many power markets rely on a central day-ahead auction in which
generators submit individual bids of quantity and price and the system operator uses these to
determine the price of the market based on the consumers demand. To find the market supply curve,
individual plants supply curves are summed horizontally. To determine the merit order of the
market, a ranking of generators with those with the lowest average variable costs to those with the
highest was built using IEA data.
In power markets with surplus capacity, too much capacity is chasing too little demand. Electricity
spot prices are determined by the marginal supplier who meets the demand. In such markets, merit
order settles the daily market price. Therefore, if the short-run marginal plants costs increase, spot
market prices will follow this trend. To what degree the increase in costs will be reflected in the
market price depends on several factors including market structure and competitive pressure from
extra available generation capacity.
Figure A and Figure B illustrate the merit order of power generation on a market. By including an
extra cost such as a carbon cost, not only has the market price increased, but there has been a change
in the order of the plants competitiveness. In Figure B, plant 2 offers a better bid than plant 1,
whereas in Figure A, without the extra cost, plant 1 is more competitive.
In the short-run section, renewable technologies other than wind technology shall not be considered.
In the short run indicates that adjustments in the capital stock (the collection of power plants) are being ignored.
Adjustments in the output of existing plants are being considered. In the short-run marginal cost, only variable costs are
included (e.g. fuel costs, variable Operating and Maintenance costs, etc.). In the long run indicates that adjustments in the
capital stock are not only being considered but are assumed to have come to completion. The long-run marginal cost
includes fixed costs, investment costs and operating costs. The marginal costs, defined in the MIT Dictionary of Modern
Economics (1992), are the extra cost of producing an extra unit of output.
The short-run marginal cost is the change in total cost resulting from a one-unit increase (or decrease) in the output
of an existing production facility.

On a daily basis, as the marginal plant adds its cost of emissions into its bids, the resulting price rise is
greater than the additional costs faced by most of the infra-marginal power stations. Because hydro
and nuclear barely emit CO2 and thus avoid any carbon constraint, they will benefit from the expected
higher market prices. Less carbon intensive facilities will receive profits whatever the choice of
allocation. Operating margins at existing generation plants could therefore, in the short run, increase
drastically. To what extent asset values of carbon intensive facilities vary will depend on the
percentage of allowances that will be auctioned to the companies.
Short-run marginal costs were calculated based on IEA data by adding fuel price, consumption and
variable Operating and Maintenance costs for each type of plant. (See below for details on the CCGT
and coal plant assumptions and Appendices 2, 3 and 4 for a full description of the assumptions on
other technologies.)
For the construction of our merit order, the case of the EU is taken as an illustration, considering the
total installed capacity of the EU15. The purpose of this Chapter is to look at the potential magnitude
of the effects, so details of the market operation have been ignored . Additional carbon emission
allowance priced at 20 per tonne of CO2 on this merit order has been included in order to investigate
the effects on the merit order.
Figure 1 represents a hypothetical merit order based on the total European installed capacity, and
facilities operating costs. The question is whether the merit order is preserved after the introduction
of a carbon emission allowance cost or whether certain power technologies become more competitive
than others.
Concerns about interconnection or transmission costs and constraints have been ignored in order to consider the
EU power market as a single competitive market.

According to the power plant assumptions detailed in Appendices 2 and 3, in terms of short-run
marginal cost, conventional hydro, wind and nuclear plants are the most competitive on the market.
This is the reason why these technologies mostly run as baseload. Coal plants with a fuel price at
1.50 per GJ and Combined-Cycled Gas Turbines (CCGT) with a gas price at 3.5 per GJ are the next
facilities in the merit order. Their relative competitiveness is sensitive to fuel price as we will see
further on. Gas prices have to decline to approximately 2.23/GJ before the two facilities have the
same short-run marginal cost. At gas prices lower than this, CCGT technologies are more competitive.
A variation in the carbon emission price has a similar effect on the plants competitiveness as a
change in fuel prices. There can be a change in merit order when a carbon emission price is included
as an additional variable cost because gas has lower CO2 emission per unit of power produced than
coal. At a CO2 price of 20 per tonne, the competitiveness order for coal and CCGT power plants
reverses. This section will, therefore, exclusively focus on a comparison between the two
technologies.
The following tables indicate the hypothesis taken for coal and CCGT power plants (see Appendices 2
and 3 for the operating costs of the other technologies).
For our scenario (Table 1), the thermal efficiency of an existing CCGT plant was set at 49 per cent.
This is lower than the efficiency of a new CCGT which reaches up to 55 per cent GCV . However, in
several European countries, the CCGT plants have been running for several years (e.g. the UK
average was 46.8 per cent in 2002). The gas price was estimated at 3.5 per GJ. A sensitivity analysis
will be discussed further on, using the maximum (4.59 per GJ) and minimum (1.89 per GJ) gas
prices over the 1998-2001 period. The avoidable cost for an existing European CCGT power plant
amounts to 27.21 per MWh. The largest component of the SRMC is fuel costs which represent
approximately 94 per cent of the operating costs. The remaining 6 per cent is variable maintenance
costs of the plant.

For the coal scenario (Table 2), a similar methodology was used. The coal price was set by the quoted
August 2003 index price at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp ports , at 40.2$/Mt, or approximately
1.50/GJ. With a 37 per cent thermal efficiency, representative of many European existing coal plants,
the fuel costs amount to 14.5/MWh, 81 per cent of the total SRMC. The remaining costs are variable
maintenance costs, over 50 per cent higher than those spent in a CCGT power plant. Nevertheless, in
our assumptions, the SRMC of a coal plant is 17.87/MWh cheaper than a gas plant. Therefore, for
most European markets, coal-fired plants are commonly used to provide part of the baseload, and also
serve as flexible capacity to follow the load curve. Coal-fired power plants exert a dominant influence
over electricity prices by providing incremental generation.

CCGT plants emit approximately half the amount of CO2 per MWh produced than coal plants.
According to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the carbon emission
factor for dry natural gas is 15.3tC/TJ (this factor is based on NCV rather than GCV) or
55,080tC/MWh. In our CCGT base case, the amount of CO2 emitted is 0.412t CO2/MWh, at a 49 per
cent efficiency rate (See Table 3). If the CO2 price equals 20/t CO2, the plant costs rise by
8.2/MWh. This leads to a 32 per cent increase in the plants operating costs.

In comparison, the coal used as an input for electricity plants (Average Coal in the IPCC guidelines)
emits 25.8tC/TJ. Considering that in the coal base case the plant runs at a 37 per cent efficiency rate,
the carbon dioxide emission is around 0.918t CO2/MWh produced. At a 20/t CO2 price, the effect on
the SRMC is immense: the SRMC increases by 95 per cent if we assume that the CO2 costs are fully
reflected in the plants operating costs (Table 4).

At a CO2 price of 20 per tonne, CCGT facilities have lower short-run marginal costs (see detailed
calculations of the carbon emission costs above), and become more competitive than coal power
plants. Therefore, a CO2 carbon price of 20 per tonne of implies a change in the EU merit order .
CCGT plants will thus appear before the coal plants in the bid order but both still operate, except if
the CO2 constraint is tough. As illustrated on the Figure 4, the CO2 price which equalises the
competitiveness of both technologies is approximately 18.5 per tonne of CO2.
This breakeven price of carbon is clearly sensitive to a number of these assumptions:
Gas prices. Gas prices are extremely volatile. According to the World Energy Outlook 2002,
in 2010, the average gas price of European imports is projected to decrease to $2.8 per MBtu
(or 3.1 per GJ). This price is nevertheless expected to increase to $3.3 per MBtu in 2020.
Therefore, as a CCGT would operate for approximately 25 years, the fuel costs would vary
considerably which could in turn influence the plants competitiveness;
Efficiency rate. Some analysis suggest that the CCGT starting operation around 2010 could
reach an average efficiency rate of 57 per cent, which would bring down the costs for running
However, it should be noted that in Europe, in the short run, there is not enough gas installed today to displace all
the coal plants.
such a plant as well as lower the carbon dioxide emissions. Similarly, a coal plant starting
operation in 2010 could expect an efficiency of 46 per cent;
Other costs driven by other environmental policies. In Europe, the Large Combustion
Plant Directive might also affect the plants operating costs. Investment decisions made on
implementing fluidised gas desulphurisation at coal plants could have impacts on the plants
emissions;
Capital costs;
Operating and Maintenance costs.
Figure 3 represents a simplified sensitivity analysis based on varying fuel prices. This was conducted
to determine the implications of the variations in gas prices (both short term volatility and long term
trends) on the short-run marginal cost and on the carbon emission price which equalises the
competitiveness of coal and gas plants.
The scenarios for the range of gas prices are based on the average European gas import price from
January 1998 to January 2002 (See Figure 2).

Figure 3 shows the changes in CCGT plants operating costs in relation to varying gas prices . The
issue here is to understand whether coal-fired or CCGT plants are more competitive at different fuel
prices, and at what CO2 price are these technologies equivalent in terms of competitive bids. The
breakeven CO2 price equals 18.5 per tonne of CO2 under the assumptions that the gas price is at 3.5
per GJ, and the coal price is estimated at 1.50 per GJ.
A similar sensitivity analysis could be made for varying coal prices.

This breakeven price of carbon is very sensitive to the fuel prices. If gas prices rise to 4.59 per GJ,
the maximum European gas import price over 1998-2001 period (see Figure 3), the carbon price
would have to rise to 34 per tonne of CO2 to equalise the competitiveness of coal and gas. A 40 per
cent change in gas prices leads to an 84 per cent change in the breakeven price. The relative
competitiveness of coal and gas is twice as sensitive to gas price differentials as it is to CO2 price.
Given the sensitivity of the breakeven price to gas assumptions, the switch in competitiveness
between the two technologies could occur in a range of different CO2 price, depending on plant
specifics (location, fuel price, efficiency, etc.).
If, however, the gas price falls under 2.23 per GJ, CCGT plants will always be more competitive
than coal plants at a 1.50 per GJ coal price, regardless of any carbon emission price. In this case, the
price of coal as a fuel for power generation will naturally decline in order to allow a better
competitiveness of this type of fuel. A response from coal producers would then be likely to occur in
order to maintain their market shares. However, if emission reductions are necessary, coal will lose
market share. This is because if coal prices drop, then CO2 prices will rise for an equivalent quantity
of reductions from the sector.
The scenarios for the range of coal prices are based on the ARA index variations between January
2000 and August 2003. During this period, the coal price varied between 0.95 per GJ to 1.54 per GJ
(See Figure 4).
The range of CO2 breakeven prices could be from zero (if the gas price makes the CCGT plant more
competitive than the coal plant) to an upper end (34 per tonne of CO2).

This breakeven price of carbon is also sensitive to the coal prices, but to a lesser extent than to gas
price variations. If coal prices rise to 1.66 per GJ, the maximum price forecasted in 2010, the
breakeven CO2 price decreases to 17.7 per tonne of CO2. If, however, the coal price falls to 0.95 per
GJ, the carbon price would have to rise to 29 per tonne of CO2 to equalise the competitiveness of
coal and gas (See Figure 5). A 28 per cent decrease in coal prices leads to a 57 per cent increase in the
breakeven point. In this case, the relative competitiveness of coal and gas is less than twice as
sensitive to coal price differentials as it is to CO2 price.
Similarly, a sensitivity analysis on the CCGT plants efficiency was carried out in order to highlight
the effects on the CO2 price which makes the two technologies equivalent in terms of competitiveness.
The efficiency rate in the CCGT base case equals 49 per cent.

As illustrated on Figure 6, at a low efficiency rate of 45 per cent for existing plants, there is a 9 per
cent increase in the CCGTs fuel costs and an 8 per cent increase in the SRMC. Henceforth, the CO2
price which equalises the competitiveness of coal and CCGT plants rises by 32 per cent to 24.5 per
tonne of CO2. If the CCGT plants efficiency rate reaches 62 per cent, the maximum rate forecasted
for plants built in 2030, the fuel costs decline by 22 per cent and the SRMC by 20 per cent. The
breakeven CO2 price falls by 65 per cent to 6.5 per tonne of CO2.
Overall, the CO2 emission price sensibility to elements included in the power plants variable costs is
very significant. Variations in gas prices and improvements in CCGT efficiency will lead to a
situation where gas and coal plants are occasionally reversed in the merit order due to additions of
carbon prices within the expected range.
Price Implications
The way generation costs get passed through to final end-use prices is complex, and there is not
uniform agreement on the way prices reflect market fundamentals. In this context, the impact of
carbon on end-users prices is even more uncertain than the impact on generation costs. However, this
section will put bounds on the likely range, focussing primarily on the impact on average prices and
on price volatility. This section is based on a microeconomic analysis of the generation sector, and
considers the market structure as static. Assumptions regarding whether the different power
technologies are owned by a single or several companies have been simplified, considering that each
power plant operates as if it is owned by a different company.
In theory, the value of carbon emission allowances should be reflected in the plants generating costs.
This is because the production of electricity always coincides with the opportunity to sell the
allowances on the emission allowance market. Therefore, this opportunity cost exists whether the
allowances were grandfathered (allocated freely) or auctioned (paid by companies). However, the
decision to pass on the full opportunity cost of allowances or only part of it depends on several
factors. The most important elements are the level of available generating capacity on the market, the
fuel mix in the power markets and the demand curve, and the allocation method.
Market concentration (coming from either actual asset ownership or production contracts coming
from contractual arrangements with third parties) is a critical issue since a company in a dominant
position would theoretically have no constraint on passing its carbon emission costs onto its wholesale
prices . Companies in a competitive market would, however, suffer from competitive pressure arising
from different sources.
Of primary importance is the available generating capacity on the market. A range of price effects will
be derived depending on the level of available capacity and the carbon intensity of this capacity. If the
demand reaches such a level that the market is tight in terms of available capacity, competitive
pressure from extra available capacity will be low. In this case, companies which emit CO2 will be
encouraged to fully feed their carbon costs through their prices. It has been observed that the CO2
penalty of the Danish cap-and-trade regime has been fully passed on to the market. As illustrated on
Figure 7, the wholesale price will rise from P0 to P1 with the introduction of a carbon emission price
if market allows passing-on. P1 represents the operating costs of the gas boiler technology including
the entire carbon emission cost. Therefore, in the case of tight available capacity, prices are expected
to rise by the additional carbon cost of the marginal producer. Power producers could incorporate the
full cost of carbon emission prices and thus make additional profits by raising their prices at that level.

However, if the market is oversupplied and extra capacity is available, two distinct situations can
occur.
In the first case (Figure 8), the demand curve is such that competition on the market is between two
producers with significant differences in terms of short-run marginal costs, regardless of any CO2
price (e.g. nuclear and coal). In this case, the carbon cost does not change the power plants rank in
the merit order. Generator N has extra available capacity which he does not use , and the demand
curve is located at point where all the supply could be met by running a part of his extra unused
capacity, or could be met by both power producers. The question here is whether the carbon costs will
be included in generator Cs price or whether C will absorb his carbon costs. If generator C passes on
his carbon costs, the market price will reach P1. The latter takes the risk of losing part of its market
share since N could be encouraged to produce more power in order to gain additional profits. To what

This could be the case if the profitability level is low. Such reserve capacity could be brought into use under more
favourable market conditions.
level would N increase his production? Generator N would increase his supply to reach a quantity just
under the electricity demand. Generator C would thus remain the marginal producer on the market,
setting therefore the electricity market price. If this were to happen, there is no reason why generator
C would not pass his carbon costs onto the market.

In the second case (Figure 9), the marginal players on the merit order are carbon intensive
technologies. With the introduction of a carbon emission price, there is a switch of the power
producers position on the merit order (e.g. coal and gas since the technologies have different carbon
intensities) and there is a reversal in the merit order if the CO2 price reaches 20 per tonne. A Bertrand
type of competition will lead the market price, meaning that each generator will react to his
competitors decision. The question put forward here is how the carbon emission costs are considered.
If allowances are grandfathered , are they accounted for as a real cost (in the same way as for other
operating costs), which implies that not passing them on to prices lead to company losses? Or are
they freely allocated allowances viewed as soft costs, meaning that they could be absorbed by the
company without any real financial losses ?

The way generators perceive their carbon costs is crucial in this type of market structure:
The Bertrand model describes a duopoly market structure. Players select price strategies sequentially. In each
period, a firm selects the action that is its best response to the action chosen by the competing firm in the previous period.
In the case of grandfathering, the distribution of allowances is free of charge and is based on the past emissions
levels. The base period or historical emissions principle starts from emissions in a chosen period, either one reference year or
the average over several years.
This implies that in this example no allowances are auctioned. The value attributed to the allowances is only in
terms of the opportunity cost.
On a strictly marginal cost accounting basis, the full carbon costs would be expected to be
passed on to the price, since (assuming that each generator is allocated less than their
Business-as-Usual emissions levels) each MWh foregone on the electricity market will reduce
the number of permits they need to buy at the end of the year;
If allowances are therefore considered as real costs, it is unlikely that generators will produce
electricity if the market price does not cover their short-run marginal cost (including the
carbon emission cost in this case);
If, however, the freely allocated grandfathered allowances only have an accountability value
because of their opportunity cost, several situations might occur:
The most extreme case occurs when both suppliers are in intense competition. In order
to maintain their share of the wholesale market, generators must keep their prices the
lowest possible. In this case, grandfathered allowances might be considered as soft
costs. The only CO2 emission costs generators will pass on to their prices are the ones
resulting from the purchase of extra allowances which were not grandfathered. The
latter situation happens when generators emit more than their annual cap. If they wish
to remain competitive, generators ought to increase their prices to the level which
compensates only for the average carbon emission cost (total carbon emission costs
paid in the year / total amount of GWh produced in the year). This increase does not
therefore account for the opportunity costs of the grandfathered allowances.
The competitiveness of both players depends on the quantity of extra allowances
bought on the trading market. Generator C might decide to produce up to the level
where his costs, including the average costs of purchased allowances over the year, are
under that of generator Gs. C would therefore remain before generator G on the merit
order (See Figure 10). Overall, because of the competitive pressure, wholesale power
prices will be lower than if generators included the opportunity cost of grandfathered
allowances as well as their average carbon emission costs.

If the market structure does not indicate full competition as in the first case, then
competitive pressure among the players will be low. Although it is impossible to
predict companies decisions and the way they perceive the carbon costs, it is likely
that wholesale electricity prices will increase more than in a highly competitive market,
since generators may feed through most of their carbon costs, absorbing them only to a
limited extent.
The treatment of new entrants is another element which will influence the decision to
pass the carbon emission costs onto electricity prices. If entry must be paid, the
emission costs of new entrants would be expected to be passed on to the prices since
each MWh produced requires purchasing one allowance . Incumbents should also be
encouraged to pass on their full carbon emission costs since new entrants will need to
amortise their plants by offering higher prices. Paid entry would also do away with the
need to strictly define what a new entrant is. If, however, reserve allowances are set
aside for new entrants and are allocated free of charge, a similar uncertainty as
described above would arise. The decision to fully feed the emission costs onto market
prices would once again depend on the amount of available generating capacity on the
market.
There are also other exceptions to price feed through of carbon emission costs:
In the case where prices are regulated, the allocated allowances would not necessarily be
reflected in prices. Countries still in the process of liberalising their power markets have laws
which regulate the prices offered to non-eligible customers. In the US Acid Rain Programme,
for example, which created a sulphur dioxide allowances trading programme, under regulated
prices, grandfathered allowances were valued at zero and had no direct effect on prices
(Burtraw, 2002). The only emission costs which were allowed to be passed on to the market
prices were costs resulting from real emission reduction efforts. A regulatory treatment of
allocated allowances under grandfathering that excluded their opportunity costs would have
two effects according to Harrison and Radov (2002). Prices would not increase, and thus
consumers would not bear additional costs and producers would not obtain additional gains.
Secondly, the lack of price effects would increase the overall costs of meeting the cap because
one of the methods of reducing CO2 emissions (reductions in customer demand for the
product due to price increases) would not be available. Thirdly, in a semi-liberalized market,
any price increase could be offset by the existing regulation. The key example is Spain, where
any increase in wholesale prices will be offset in lower stranded cost compensation to
generators until the expiration of stranded costs32;
In the case of international competition, companies could suffer from competitive
distortions since competitors include companies which are not subject to any emission
constraint. This could limit the carbon emission cost feed through. This argument applies less
strongly to the power sector than for other sectors in the EU ETS since international
competition is limited by interconnection constraints;
Note that carbon emission markets should be sufficiently liquid to exert any entry barrier or price manipulation.
This assumes that stranded costs are larger than the revenue upside which almost is certainly the case.
Competitive pressure from border markets also plays a key role. The competitive
pressure from neighbouring countries will depend on the interconnection capacity of a country
with its surrounding markets. If for example, coal plants feed their carbon emission costs
through the market price, in terms of short-run marginal costs, nuclear plants will be far more
competitive. If there is additional unused nuclear capacity in a border country, suppliers may
decide to import nuclear, nuclear companies gaining additional foreign market shares. In
general, however, since all EU countries are covered by the directive, and imports and exports
from outside EU are negligible, this effect for the EU as a whole is likely to be small. In other
words, the EU market is a captive market, and this overall would encourage price feedthrough. This might not be the same for other regions considering emissions trading, nor is it
true for other sectors covered by the EU scheme that are open to international competition;
Updating allocation based on output  including between trading periods. The updating
approach bases future allocations on a plants current and future activities (i.e. power
generation). If the updating formula is based on production, for example, a plant would
clearly have an incentive to increase its output in 2008 to receive more allowances in 201033.
The power company would, therefore, be inclined to not fully pass its emission costs on to its
prices in order maintain its market share. The electricity price would not, in this case, reflect
the opportunity cost of allowances to cover the emissions from producing the power.
Updating based on emission, a more likely option under the EU ETS, could lead to similar
incentives to maintain emissions and restrict power price increases although behavior is
complicated by the presence of a CO2 cap;
Market power. Companies which benefit from an important market share in the power
generation sector could be willing to limit their emission cost feed through in order to make
entry in the market more difficult;
Customer switching. The degree at which customers switch supplier following a price
increase influence companies decision to feed-through the carbon emission cost. This point
can be related to the competition issue raised earlier. Choice potentially provides further
competitive discipline to the producers along the value chain.
Table 5 shows the potential effects that carbon emission pricing could have on electricity prices in the
wholesale markets and retail markets. The question is whether electricity companies under a CO2 cap
will be able to pass the cost on to the wholesale market or will need to reduce their profit margin. In
either case, this will have important consequences on the power sector in terms of fuel mix, as well as
capacity to raise financing for new capital investment.
Nevertheless, such updating could be counter-productive, since it in practice will incentivize a player to pollute as
much as possible (as long as there is a positive slope in the CO2-price forward slope).

The McKinsey model suggests that the average wholesale electricity spot price of continental Europe
would rise about 30 per cent above the level that would prevail without a carbon emission price at 25
per tonne of CO2. The model then forecasts a second-order effect as thermal power generation fuel
shifts from coal to gas. The gas use annual growth rate would rise to 3.8 per cent, from 2.7 per cent,
requiring the development of new and less accessible gas fields, therefore pushing up the price of gas
by perhaps 15 per cent. All else being equal, the forecasted increase would in turn raise the operating
costs of gas plants. Henceforth, as compared with their business-as-usual scenario, McKinsey
estimates that the wholesale prices of electricity would rise by a further 10 per cent, producing a total
increase of about 40 per cent by 2008. An increase of this order would in turn increase by 15 per cent
the price for end-users, since the wholesale price constitutes about 40 per cent of the domestic retail
price.
Using its proprietary Integrated Power Model for Europe which includes power plant data, CO2, NOx,
and SO2 emissions data, and transmission constraint data for more than 30 countries in the EU, EEA,
and Accession Countries, ICF Consulting estimates an average EU-wide demand-weighted wholesale
power price of 19 percent under its base case scenario. The study reveals that some countries such as
the UK and Germany may see much more significant increases. ICF Consulting's study includes
several sensitivities for different allocation scenarios as well as different market-clearing prices for
EU Allowances to assess the range of full impacts on power plant asset values. ICF Consulting's
analysis in the base case also reveals that the power sector's internal abatement cost curve reaches
approximately 17 /tonne in the 2008-2012 period.
The McKinsey report includes Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, and Switzerland.
Impact of CO2 Trading on a Country Basis
An EU survey by the Dresdner Bank forecasts electricity wholesale power price increases on a
country level. In their 2006 low carbon emission cost scenario at 7.5 per tonne of CO2, the increase
in wholesale prices will range between 3 per cent for Spain and 22 per cent for Germany. The reason
why Spanish prices may not fully reflect the higher opportunity costs resulting from CO2 trading is
because prices are still likely to be significantly influenced by regulated tariffs for the next few years.
By contrast, German power prices are below new entrant levels. The effect of CO2 trading could then
be to see substantially higher prices, reflecting the full effect on the merit order. In their high 2006
scenario at a 20 per tonne of CO2, the growth ranges between 7 per cent and 57 per cent for the same
countries.
Source: Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein
According to the merit order described in Chapter 1 Section 1, the effect of a carbon emission price at
20 per tonne of CO2 is a 21 per cent increase in Europes wholesale power prices. To calculate this
electricity price increase, we assumed that the variation in electricity demand over a year follows a
Normal distribution . Considering this merit order and a demand level at 255 GW, the weighted
average carbon cost on the market is 10 per MWh. This weighted carbon emission cost is evaluated
under the hypothesis that generators fully pass on their carbon costs to their wholesale prices. Overall,
this represents a total price increase amounts to 21 per cent .
While some plants could see dramatic increases in asset value based on increases in electricity
production and wholesale prices, others should now be considering retirement. The exact outcomes,
however, depend critically on the allocation rules set. The results clearly demonstrate that this will be
a sea change for players in the European power sector.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (2003): Emission Trading Carbon Derby, Pan-European Utility Research, UK.
A 20 per cent standard deviation from the average European electricity consumption is hypothesised. For this
exercise, the EU consumption in 2000 (2237 TWh) was used. Moreover, the average European industrial electricity price in
the same year reached 47.12 per MWh according to IEA data (Energy Prices and Taxes Quarterly Statistics First Quarter
2003).
Note that if the carbon emission price is at 25 per tonne of CO2, wholesale electricity prices increase by 27 per
cent using the same methodology as described above.
THE LONGER TERM IMPACT ON INVESTMENT DECISIONS
To encourage new capacity addition, expected wholesale prices have to cover the future long-run
marginal costs of generation. These costs include operating and capital costs required for new
capacity. It is only if the future market prices are expected to reach the long-run marginal cost of
plants that incumbents or new entrants decide on building new power plants . In liberalised markets,
electricity prices should theoretically be capped by the long-run marginal cost. If on-going electricity
prices remain above this level, new plants will be built which will push the prices back down.
The long-run marginal cost of generation depends on the technology. Nuclear plants have very low
operating costs, but high capital costs. Moreover, the lead time is approximately ten or more years,
much longer than the construction of thermal plants for example. By contrast, CCGT plants have a
low unit investment cost and a short construction time with coal lying somewhere between the two.
Both of these facts reduce the economic risk of new projects, which is especially important for smaller
new entrants even though CCGT has relatively high fuel costs. Therefore, in the long term, natural gas
fired CCGTs are projected to have an important share in terms of capacity additions as this
technology offers several financial and operational advantages.
This chapter looks at investment decisions including construction of new plants, the switching of fuels
in an existing plant, and the costs for refurbishing old plants. How carbon is factored in to these
decisions as an additional risk will then be investigated, to see whether carbon markets make
investment more or less risky, whether it affects the choice of plant, and how it might affect reserve
margins.
Resulting from the technology choices discussed above, this chapter also considers second order
effects of a carbon emission constraint. It analyses whether this could have implications on the
economics of other energy sectors, in particular the gas sector. It also examines whether market power
could be exercised on the emission trading market. Finally, it considers the possible links between
emission trading schemes and other trading markets, focusing primarily on the tradable renewable
energy certificate systems.
Changes in generation mix: directions and trends in investment
The purpose of this first section is to assess the impact of a CO2 constraint on long-run marginal costs
of different power technologies. Will some technologies become less competitive than others with the
introduction of a carbon emission allowance? Will the introduction of a carbon emission cost
influence investment decisions in new facilities? At what carbon emission price will it be more
competitive to build or replace coal plants by CCGTs?
In calculating our long-run marginal generation costs, the model built in the first section was
completed in order to include plants capital and financial costs. Table 6 gives a summary of the
technical, economic and financial parameters assumed in our CCGT assumptions. The calculations in
this model do not reflect all the details of an actual power plant project . The simplifications do not,
It is important to note that the forecasted future market prices are based on current market prices.
Therefore, the prices which actually encourage plant construction are current market prices that are above the
long term marginal costs.
For additional information on investments required across all energy sectors, see World Energy
Investment Outlook, IEA, which will be published in November 2003.
for example, take into the cash flow during construction, the Return on Equity required, or a
repayment schedule of project debt.
At baseload, the plant has an average net capacity of 600MW. The total plant development costs are
estimated at 300 million, capital cost assessed at $500/kW. In our base case scenario, the economic
plant life is set at 25 years. Fuel costs are lower than in the short-run marginal modelled assumptions.
According to the 2002 World Energy Outlook, in 2010, natural gas European imports will be
$2.8/MBtu, or approximately $2.95/GJ. Fuel costs for a future CCGT plant will thus reach
19.6/MWh, under the hypothesis that the thermal efficiency rate of a new CCGT plant will increase
to 55 per cent. The pre-tax return of the plant is fixed at 8 per cent, in line with several data for
project-financed power plants in Europe. Total generation costs of a new CCGT amount to
29.60/MWh. Fuel costs represent the largest portion, with 66 per cent of total generation costs.

Likewise, the coal assumptions in Table 7 were completed in order to evaluate the costs of building a
new coal steam-fired plant. At baseload, the plants capacity is 750MW, representative of the new
coal plants being build across Europe. The thermal efficiency of the new plant is 40 per cent, higher
than that of existing coal plants. The fuel price is more expensive, estimated at 1.66/GJ. Overall, the
total generation costs reach 34.4/MWh. This cost is higher than costs for new CCGT plants, and the
competitive differential increases when a CO2 constraint is introduced.
Conversion rate assumption is 1$ = 1

The combustion of natural gas in modern gas turbines leads to very low emissions. As underlined
above, modern plants have a very high fuel efficiency of about 55 per cent. This allows the plant to
benefit from a smaller carbon emission rate. At a 20/t CO2 price, the plants carbon cost is 7,3MWh,
at an emission rate of 0.367t per MWh produced. The long-run marginal cost including the carbon
cost reaches 36.95/MWh (See Table 8).

The effect of a carbon constraint is emphasized for a new steam boiler coal fired plant. At a 40 per
cent fuel efficiency rate, the carbon emitted is approximately 0.85 tonne per MWh. At a 20/t CO2
carbon price, the plants CO2 costs reach 17/MWh (Table 9), more than doubling the costs of
generation.

For off-shore wind generation to be competitive with gas combined cycle technologies, the price of
emissions allowances would have to approach 80 a tonne of CO2 in a high load factor scenario for
wind around 40 per cent. However, with a low load factor around 30 per cent, the allowances would
have to increase to 116 a tonne of CO2. Likewise, for on-shore wind generation to be competitive
with CCGT plants, emission allowances would have to range between 107 a tonne of CO2 and 30 a
tonne, the load factor for onshore varying from 17 to 35 per cent. On-shore wind plants could become
competitive with CCGT and coal plants if the load factor was higher than 35 per cent. However, the
load factor varies one year to another.
For biomass from energy crops to become competitive with CCGT technologies, the price of the
carbon would have to range from 140 to 245 a tonne of CO2, depending on the amount of operating
costs.
The introduction of a carbon price could stimulate investment in wind generation only to a limited
extent. Moreover, it would be necessary to guarantee that renewables such as wind and solar energy
could generate a reliable source of energy. This is the reason why separate green certificate schemes
are being discussed as a policy option to develop renewables. According to McKinsey, while such
technologies will be essential to keep emissions in compliance with the targets as energy use rises,
they will not contribute too greatly to the Kyoto compliance targets up to 2012.
CCGT plants are likely to be the option for new capacity additions in the future EU environmental
context where gas is available. Their advantages in terms of emissions, efficiency, and costs compared
to coal facilities make it likely that companies will favour building gas plants against coal plants.
However, if CCGT plants account for the majority of the generation capacity built, this will increase
dependence on gas imports, as discussed further on in the section on Second order effects.
Furthermore, the introduction of carbon costs increases CCGTs long-run marginal cost advantage. If
the price of carbon emission is relatively high, the impact of the carbon emission constraint may be so
significant that companies will also need to arbitrate between keeping their coal plants in operation
and building more efficient CCGT plants.
Comparing short-run marginal costs with long-run marginal costs shows at which level it is more
profitable to continue operating an existing coal-fired plant rather than build a new gas-fired one.
Figure 12 shows which technology is more competitive in relation to a varying carbon emission price
using a coal price at 1.50 per GJ and a gas price at 3.5 per GJ. The question here is whether it is
more profitable for a company to run its existing plants or whether it should invest in a modern power
plant with a different fuel. Moreover, under a specific carbon price, which technology is more
competitive?

Without any carbon emission price and under normal circumstances, operating costs of an existing
coal plant are lower than full costs of a new CCGT plant. However, in the decision making process,
if a carbon emission price is introduced, depending on its level, it will be a decisive element in terms
of running an existing plant or building a new one. If the carbon emission prices range between:
0 and 18.5 per tonne of CO2, operating costs of existing coal facilities are lower than that of
existing CCGT plants. Coal plants are the preferred technology. The coal plants will be
dispatched before CCGTs on the merit order if we consider the fuel prices used in Chapter 1
Section 1. The plants competitiveness nevertheless depends on the prices of coal and gas;
18.5 and 23.2 per tonne of CO2, CCGT plants are more competitive than coal plants.
Nevertheless, coal plants will continue to operate. Whether these plants will operate as
baseload facilities or shoulder capacity will depend on the demand curve;
Above 23.2 per tonne of CO2, it is more profitable for companies to shut down their coal
plants and to build modern CCGT plants. Many high-emissions plants such as old coal-fired
ones which remain in operation may be required only for regular peaks in demand;
These results do not take into account the possibilities of existing coal plants to be refurbished
or repowered in order to increase their efficiency and thus reduce their CO2 emissions per
kWh.
or long-run marginal cost
McKinsey estimates using its model described in Chapter 1 Section 2 that from 2005 to 2012, about a
third of these plants will switch to that role, which might therefore require investments to change their
operating patterns, while a third will remain at base-load capacity and a third will be shut down in
favour of gas. Thanks to better gas turbine technologies and to the assumption that there will be a long
term availability of cheap gas supplies in Europe, one effect of CO2 emission regulation would be that
gas will take over coals role as the backbone of non-nuclear electricity supply much more quickly.
It is too early to know whether the new ICGT clean coal technology could modify this environment.
What level of emission reductions would drive such CO2 prices in those ranges is not possible to
assess from the model described in this paper. However, the Boston Consulting Group assumes that if
the European power sector would have to reduce 25 per cent of the total targeted CO2 reduction
(Europes burden under business-as-usual scenario), CO2 prices would reach 25 per tonne of CO2. If
power generators were to shoulder 50 per cent of the total reduction, a carbon price would reach 35.
Economics of mothballing/retiring
The short-run marginal cost represents a floor for electricity prices in liberalised markets. Over a
monthly or yearly period, utilities will not produce power if they cannot at least cover the variable
cost of generation. Inability to cover operating costs is an economic signal that most inefficient
capacity on the system should be closed. The only exception to this rule would be circumstances
under which closure costs are prohibitive, for nuclear capacity for example.
Mothballing is the temporary closure of a power plant to the state from which it may be
recommissioned. This decision to temporarily shut down a power plant rather than leaving it in
operation lies in the fact that in some cases, it is a more economical option. The decision to mothball
may occur even when generation prices are slightly above the short-run marginal cost. To mothball a
power plant allows for significant reductions in station-level fixed costs.
Table 10 illustrates this point. The choice is whether to mothball capacity or to keep the coal plant
running at a market price marginally above the plants short-run marginal cost of 18.26 per MWh
(see Chapter 1 Section 1 for details on the coal plant assumptions). The logic here is that, while
operating above the short-run marginal cost allows the company to make a significant contribution to
station-level fixed costs, mothballing allows for a significant reduction in station-level fixed costs.
Savings in fixed costs are assumed to be around 50 per cent of the total fixed operating cost. In this
example, operating or mothballing offer equal economic rewards at a price premium per MWh of
1.75 per MWh. If the market price falls below this threshold of 20 per MWh, mothballing would be
more economic for the company.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that mothballing is a complex and expensive procedure.
Generators often need to have authorisation from the electricity regulator, an administrative process
which can last up to six months. Mothballing is also an expensive and risky procedure because of the
difficulties that lie in restarting the plants  particularly where the original labour has been lost.
Moreover, the mothballing period must be long enough to allow the generator to have sufficient
information on whether to recommission the plant or close it definitively.
The BCG assumes that to reach such a reduction in emissions, a minimum CO2 price of 25 per tonne of CO2
would be required. The price could be imposed by issuing a limited number of carbon-emission tradable permits.

The electricity price level at which power companies are profitable will change once a carbon cost is
introduced. The decision to mothball an existing coal plant may be accelerated if a CO2 price of 20
per tonne is incorporated in the power generation cost. This is because at a CO2 price of 20 per tonne
of CO2, if companies consider their opportunity cost as real costs, the electricity price has to reach
37.03 per MWh for the power generation to have the same price premium as before (See Table 11).
The electricity price that insures the same price premium could be lower if power companies only
considered the average cost paid for the allowance as part of their operating costs. If the market price
is below the levels which assure a set price premium, it is more economic for the company to shut
down its plant. An increase in the market price to reach this level will depend on the carbon cost feedthrough.

Overall, a carbon emission constraint could have a positive as well as a negative effect on the market
structure. The advantage of introducing a carbon emission constraint is that inefficient coal-fired
plants will be encouraged to leave the market because they are the plants which emit the highest
amount of CO2. However, if the decommissioning of plants is accelerated, the markets reserve
margin may be affected if the amount of lost capacity is not compensated by the construction of new
capacity, despite an increase in wholesale prices due to the uncertainties described before.
Additionally, capacity held in mothballing acts as a clear deterrent to potential new entrants coming
onto the system and curtailing the speed of price recovery. A potential new entrant is faced with the
threat that, as prices rise, capacity will come out of cold reserve. Since the plant in cold reserve is
existing capacity, it does not, unlike the potential entrant, have to cover its capital costs if the plant
has been fully depreciated and as a result, can survive in a lower price environment than the new
entrant.
In practice, mothballing rates may not be as high as expected. Despite the introduction of an ETS,
high emission plants may be able to survive at a low utilization rate and thus decrease their
emissions . The reason is that there are a number of low price hours in which high emitting plants are
This will contribute positively on the countries energy security policy.
competitive. In particular, this is the case if updating is based on historic emissions. It is also the case
for lignite plants. Their very high exit costs help to keep them online. This creates a somewhat
strange effect that lignite survives better than coal despite higher emissions.
Refurbishment of old coal plants and switching of fuel
In the near term, while energy supply and conversion remains dominated by fossil fuels, switching
from coal to oil or gas within existing plants can play an important role in emission reductions. At
similar conversion levels, when energy efficiencies are unchanged, a shift from coal to oil implies a
reduction in carbon emissions of 17 per cent, from oil to gas 23.5 per cent, and from coal to gas 43 per
cent per unit of primary energy . Therefore, one effect of CO2 emission caps could be an increase in
consumption of gas relative to coal.
However, a number of specific barriers exist for promoting a switch to lower-carbon emission fossil
fuels. The first is the availability and distribution costs of natural gas: transporting natural gas is more
expensive than transporting oil. Concerns may also arise for energy security and fuel costs 
especially in countries which have large coal reserves such as Germany and Poland. Therefore, future
availability and costs of gas may in the near term limit switching.
According to the Interlaboratory Working Group (Int, 2000) the economics are in most cases
unfavorable with the current price levels of coal and natural gas. The additional investments are not
justified by the extra cost for natural gas compared to cheap coal, and furthermore the sunk costs in
the coal-fired power plant can make the switch very uneconomical. The switching of coal plants to
gas plants would also imply investments in gas pipeline infrastructure to supply the fuel switched
power plant. However, such a switch could take place if a high carbon emission price is introduced.
Our figures suggest this would be around 23 per tonne of CO2.
Another solution which reduces carbon emission from coal plants is the replacement of coal by
biomass in existing boilers or co-combustion. In the IPCC methodology, biomass fuels are not
included in the CO2 emissions. This is because for CO2 emissions, biomass consumption for fuel is
assumed to equal its regrowth. For each kWh produced by biomass fuel, direct co-combustion
reduces the CO2 emissions in the coal plant by 918g/kWh. Specific additional investment costs for 10
per cent co-combustion from biomass energy are estimated around 40 per kW according to a survey
by Ree et al (2001). Overall, total costs reach 6.2 per t CO2 (see Table 12 in which additional
operating costs are excluded), using the coal plant assumptions in Chapter 1 Section 1.

As illustrated in Table 12, the costs for coal - biomass co-combustion are low compared to the costs
borne by coal generators who have not made these investments and face a high price of CO2
emissions. Co-firing biomass with clean coal is a developing technology, which might be deployed in
new build plants, especially within the life span of the renewable energy obligations . However, the
co-combustion is not unlimited. The potential replacement depends on many factors: technical
limitations as well as limitations imposed by the authorities, and financial and legal provisions. The
main technical constraint that limits the co-combustion capacity of biomass/waste in conventional
coal fired power plants is the quality (for instance lower heating value) of the biomass, if the load of
the plant remains the same. Other technical aspects considered when maximising biomass input in
existing coal-fired plants are the operating flexibility and the maximum load. All of these aspects are
important in a liberalised electricity market. The limits imposed by the authorities are also
determining. In the UK, for example, co-firing for renewable energy certificates must end by 2011.
In order to reduce the existing coal plants CO2 emissions, a further solution is to invest in their
refurbishment. Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in several ways including
improvements in boilers and turbines. A Mott MacDonald survey lists the major areas where coal
stations have been looking to increase efficiency. Refurbishment costs range from 8/t CO2 to 400
per tonne of t CO2.
In the UK, by April 2003, eight coal power stations were involved in co-firing, burning biomass energy
(woodchips, agricultural waste, palm nuts, etc.) mixed with coal. Interest in co-firing was sparked by the launch of the UK
governments Renewable Obligation scheme which created a guarantee for green power. Companies earn green certificates
for the power they generate from the biomass. In April, those were trading around 48 pounds a MWh, more than twice the
price of wholesale electricity.

Between 18.5 and 23 per tonne of CO2, CCGT plants are more competitive than coal plants (see
results found in Chapter 2 Section 1). If carbon emission prices are expected to remain in that range
for an extended period, companies may decide to improve their coal plants efficiency. According to
the Mott MacDonald data, if carbon prices are under 23.2, power plant owners can invest in
upgrading only existing equipments (new boiler stop valves, modified cylinder seals, etc.) The total
CO2 emissions saved if the coal power plant described in Chapter 1 Section 1 undertakes these
investments reach approximately 102 591 tonnes of CO2. This allows the plant to save around 2.13
per cent of its total CO2 emission per year using the same coal assumptions. Nevertheless, coal plant
might not reach competitiveness with CCGT technology since the difference in terms of annual
emissions between coal and CCGT plants is approximately 3 199 316 tonnes of CO2 .
Investment in Coal-Fired Power Generation, the Case of RWE
RWE Rheinbraun has completed an extensive programme of retrofits, enabling them to increase the
average efficiency of its German lignite-fired power plants by 1.3 per cent and reduce the carbon
dioxide emissions by around 2 million tonnes a year. When its lignite-fired power plant with
optimised plant engineering goes on line at Niederaussem in 2002, they will cut the carbon dioxide
emissions by another 2.5 million tonnes per annum. The power plant will achieve an efficiency of at
least 43 per cent.

Table 13 summarises the impact of a CO2 price on investments and generation costs in the power
sector. The effects of a CO2 price are, however, based on the power plants assumptions on an
aggregate level and do not include plant specificities. In reality, details in plant economics will
deviate. This will, therefore, smooth out the results. In reality, it is important to note that emission
reductions will start to occur below the 18.5 per tonne of CO2 threshold.
The value of the increased output and the CO2 effect of the increased output are included in the calculation of net
cost.

Second order effects of emissions trading on the gas market
As described above, combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) are the technology of choice for power
companies constrained by emission caps. Their advantages in terms of CO2 emissions, flexibility and
their investment costs compared to other fossil fuel technologies make them likely to become the
backbone of new capacity. This investment choice means that gas will increasingly become the
preferred fuel in power generation. However, gas production in OECD, Europe and North America is
not expected to grow as strongly as gas demand in these regions. Countries such as the EU countries
will become more import dependent as a consequence of the introduction of emissions trading. In
OECD Europe, import dependency is expected to rise from 36 per cent in 2000 to 67 per cent in 2030
and prices are likely to rise accordingly.
Short-term security of supply is not a problem in OECD Europe thanks to the spare capacity in
transportation and supply, and the numerous tools developed by gas operators to cope with possible
supply disruptions such as gas storage facilities . Nevertheless, with growing reliance of gas imports,
the access to such supply in the long term at attractive conditions is also crucial. However, most of the
potential future gas is projected to come from sources located in technically challenging and
politically risky environments. The development of new gas supplies and the infrastructure to deliver
the commodity to the market will therefore require substantial investments. Similarly, imported
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects from African and Middle Eastern countries will also be costly
in comparison to existing supplies.
Raising the capital for new investments in gas pipelines and LNG-regasification infrastructure will,
however, be challenging since several regulatory uncertainties in the sector remain. Gas players will
be unlikely to commit the needed investments without secure long-term contracts which include the
capital costs. But because of the opening of the electricity market to competition, power generators
are unlikely to agree to the tight terms that gas infrastructure players need in order to sign the
contracts. This is because wholesale electricity prices have become more volatile. Likewise, the gas
market is also opening to market competition, which will increase risks and uncertainty, thereby
making it potentially more difficult to sign long term contracts. Other uncertainties include the
stringency of emission allowances and the consequent demand for new gas-fired plants. Those
uncertainties are perceived as an additional risk by investors . Overall, for the capital to be raised,
prices of gas will have to rise to provide investors with sufficiently attractive returns .
If, however, the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply development were undertaken in
order to secure gas imports, the gas consumers could face the prospect of having to pay significantly
higher gas prices. Prices would likely rise because of the higher costs for gas delivery than the old
sources. Therefore, to make these new gas sources profitable, gas prices are likely to rise which will
in turn increase wholesale electricity prices adding to the increase following carbon emission costs.
According to WEO projections, the share of gas in European electricity generation is forecasted to increase
significantly, from 16 per cent to 41 per cent in 2030.

Generation, BCG Report, May.
Another reason why gas prices might increase is related to the way the gas prices are fixed in long
term contracts. In continental Europe, gas is mostly supplied under long term contracts, which set a
base price and a formula for adjusting that price at regular intervals. The base price has traditionally
been negotiated on the basis of the market value of the gas against competing fuels, taking into
account the cost of transportation from the delivery point to the point of final consumption. Thus the
price paid by gas companies or power producers is related to the level of competition with other fuels.
With the introduction of a carbon emission cost, gas-fired technologies ought to be the technology of
choice which gives additional value to gas. Therefore, because of the new carbon emission constraint,
gas suppliers might be inclined to claim some of the value attributed to the difference in CO2
emissions between gas and coal. Gas suppliers might include this additional CO2 emission value in
their gas contracts, thereby increasing their gas prices.
Overall, gas operating prices are likely to increase because the introduction of a carbon emission price
will lead to new investments in gas-fired technologies. McKinsey estimates that the price of gas will
increase by 15 per cent. As compared with the business-as-usual case, the wholesale price of
electricity would rise by a further 10 per cent, producing a total increase of about 40 per cent (see
Chapter 1 Section 2 for details on McKinseys assumptions).
Market Power in the Emission Trading Markets
Two types of market power are usually defined in relation to emissions trading (Burniaux, 1999) :
capacity to influence the transaction price of traded permits (cost minimising or profit
maximising manipulation);
exclusionary manipulation, by which the producer of a commodity hoards tradable permits
to prevent the entrance of competitors on the market of that commodity.
An essential component of market power in the emissions trading market is the quantity of allowances
that any participant may acquire or transfer. If allowances are grandfathered to the existing electricity
producers, the concentration of allowances on a few large producers can create a significant risk for
the first type of market power. A dominating source (or a coalition of sources) may attempt to
manipulate the price as a monopolist (seller) or monopsonist (buyer). This market power depends on
the firms size relative to the market in which it is operating. If a dominating source offers too few
allowances, this can increase the prices artificially and therefore, the company can benefit from
monopoly power by withholding allowances. If the dominating source buys too few allowances, this
can cause the prices to fall to a lower level than normal. The company thus exerts monopsony power.
In both cases, the dominant source may achieve a net gain at the expense of a cost-effective
outcome .

model. OECD paper. Economics Directorate, OECD, Paris.
Svendsen, G.T., Versterdal, M. (2003): How to design greenhouse gas trading in the EU?, Energy Policy 31
1531-1539
Under exclusionary manipulation, a firm that holds a significant share of total tradable allowances
decides to hoard them in order to exclude other firms from its product market. This second risk
illustrates the case where a dominant electricity source uses the allowance market to increase barriers
to entry for outsiders. The incentive to exclude competitors in the product market may cause a
monopolistic behaviour as a source (or a pool of sources) may refuse to sell allowances to new
entrants and thereby create a barrier to entry, i.e. a cost of production. Such a predatory source may
in this way increase its opportunity for manipulating the price in the product market (Tietenberg,
1985, p.138) . According to Svendsen and Vesterdal, this behaviour must be considered here as the
two emitting sources are direct competitors in the same product market (electricity), emitting the same
pollutant (CO2) in the same regulated area (the European Union for example).
If we take the example of EDF, the largest European electricity producer, it is also one of the smallest
CO2 emitters. A PricewaterhouseCoopers survey based on the EU15 finds that the five largest CO2
58 59
emitters
have a cumulated CO2 emissions share of 60 per cent of the total European CO2 market.
EDF is not, however, among the top five emitters. The dominant CO2 emitters could exert market
manipulation to some degree, but EDF could not, as a small emitter, influence the entry into the
electricity market by refusing to sell CO2 allowances to a potential competitor. Therefore, the second
risk concerning strategic interaction will less likely occur than the first risk.
The second type of market power may also not be a significant problem with the international
greenhouse gas emissions trading, at least in the following instances. The market players in the future
Kyoto scheme, as well as in the EU scheme, will cover a broad range of different economic activities.
A new entrant in a given sector, which must cover its emissions by CO2 allowances, would then have
access to tradable permits from entities outside its own sector. These entities would have limited
interest in hoarding their tradable permits, as they do not compete on the same market as the new
entrant. Exclusionary manipulation seems therefore difficult if many sectors and firms are allowed to
trade nationally and internationally.
Utility generators and autogenerators account for 64 per cent of the total CO2 emissions from the
different sectors covered by the European greenhouse gas market Directive , according to a Dresdner
Kleinwort Wasserstein survey . The first category of price manipulation from the dominant electricity
companies on the global EU emission trading market might, therefore, occur if they agree to act
collectively as one entity. However, the probability that the largest emitters agree to form a cartel and
behave as a single dominant player against the rest of the market players is low. Market power on the
trading market will thus be limited in the EU and will be even more limited in the international market
since no players will have a dominant share in terms of CO2 emissions. The trading market should
thus be liquid enough to avoid market power.

Linkages with renewable energy obligations and trade markets
Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are undergoing important developments at all levels in the
European Union. The European Union has adopted in October 2001 a directive on the promotion of
electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES) in the internal electricity market. The aim
of this directive is to promote an increase in the contribution of renewable energy sources in the
energy supply. The directive seeks to increase the consumption of energy from renewables to 12 per
cent, and electricity to 22.1 per cent, by 2010. This overall target has been broken down and allocated
among member states. The directive does not include mandatory targets but imposes obligations on
member states to adopt national indicative targets consistent with the European Unions overall
objective. This obligation will have an important impact on countries generation mix as well as on
emissions trading.
There is a definite link between the development of renewable sources and greenhouse gas emission
reductions. Increased use of renewable power production results in lower thermal production, which
leads to a decrease in the total amount of emissions (Jensen et al., 2003). Figure 13 illustrates the
displacement of certain fossil fuel technologies on the short-run merit order with the introduction of a
renewable energy production (or consumption) quota, which since it is obligatory, effectively comes
at the front of the merit order.

On the short run, renewable energy technologies such as onshore and offshore wind and small
hydroelectric turbines are the most competitive on the merit order of the electricity market. If
companies decide to build these technologies as an option to meet their renewable energy target,
certain fossil fuel technologies will be displaced on the spot market assuming that the demand is
stable. The green quota will therefore help lower emissions and consequently function indirectly as an
emission quota, although the amount of emissions displaced is uncertain.
Links between Tradable Renewable Energy Certificates and Emission Allowances
In the long term, renewable energy will be an important part of the solution to developing a
sustainable energy system. However, as we have seen in Chapter 2 Section 1, renewables cannot
currently compete on power grids with other fossil fuel technologies unless a high CO2 emission price
is introduced (ranging from 100 to 200). This has led to the development of separate promotion
schemes for renewables. One of the schemes that are being discussed internationally is a market for
renewable energy certificates.
Within the past few years, targets for the deployment of renewables have been set in several countries
and green certificate markets have attracted extensive interest in Europe and elsewhere. These
markets have appeared in a number of countries, including Denmark, Italy, Belgium (Flanders)
England and Australia (Morthorst, 2001). The principle of tradable renewable energy certificate
(TREC) schemes is similar to tradable emission allowances. Power companies are mandated to
produce or hold a certain share of total output from renewable energy (RE) sources and must redeem
certificates to the regulator testifying that they have done so. Certificates are issued for each unit (1
MWh in most TGC schemes) of electricity form RE has been exported to the grid. These certificates
are financial assets and are tradable.
The idea of a tradable renewable energy certificate (TREC) approach is to use market forces to
determine the necessary additional payments to investors in renewable plants. Thus, the payment to
renewables consists of two parts: one from the sale of the electricity produced to the spot market and
the other from the sale of the green certificates. As a result of this, the price obtainable by the
producer of the renewable electricity is the sum of the market-based settling prices for physical power
and green certificates.
TREC systems, at a domestic level, and possibly at an international level will operate alongside the
broader greenhouse gas emission trading system introduced under the Kyoto Protocol. The questions
raised in this section are could the two markets interact and is there a need for a linkage of the market
for renewable certificates with that for carbon certificates.
Could the Two Markets Interact?
Over the long run, as we have seen in Chapter 2 Section 1, renewable energy technologies are more
expensive than certain fossil fuel plants. However, the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of renewables
can be subdivided into two parts: one part will be covered through the sale of electricity; the residual
part has to be covered by the price of a green certificate (see above).
When tradable allowance schemes are implemented along with tradable renewable certificates, for a
domestic development of renewables, three markets interact. Figure 14 illustrates how the different
markets relate to each other.
Figure 14
The Interacting Markets between Green Certificates and Emission Allowances

RE generators

Allowance market
On the power market, three players interact. RE generators and fossil fuel producers supply
the market with electricity and at the other end consumers purchase on the physical power
market.
On the allowance market, thermal generators can purchase or sell CO2 emission allowances.
They have the obligation to hold a number of emission allowances corresponding to the level
of emissions resulting from following their production.
On the certificate market, RE generators sell the green certificates (TRECs) based on the
amount of power they produce. The buyers depend on who holds the renewable obligation 
this could either be generators or electricity suppliers. The certificates, however, also hold the
value of CO2 reductions achieved by RE investment.
The tradable green certificates could theoretically carry a certain value corresponding to the CO2
reduction since producing renewable energy decreases total emissions. Converting renewable energy
(RE) certificates into GHG emission allowances could be done if a conversion factor were accepted
by the governments in countries where the schemes were to be linked (Baron and Serret, 2002). A
TREC represents proof that renewable energy has been used to generate an amount of power (e.g. 1
MWh) .
The emission allowance market and the certificate markets could, therefore, interact. Hence, if there is
a value to every CO2 reduction which can be sold on the permit market, the value of green certificates
could be subdivided into the value of CO2 reduction and the residual which represents the TREC
(Morthorst, 2001). Figure 15 illustrates this breakdown.
However, one of the limits to the linkage between the green certificate market and the CO2 emission market is the
evaluation of the amount of emissions avoided. Finding which plants are being displaced by the RE is not impossible to
determine, but would be cumbersome, as it would require doing so every time a TREC is issued. A TREC issued at the peak
of the electricity load curve would therefore not carry the same avoided carbon as the TREC issued off-peak (Baron and
Serret, 2002).

Revenue A is the price of electricity at the spot market. The value of CO2 reduction achieved will be
equivalent to the cost of an alternative domestic emission reduction (B) (i.e. the price on the relevant
emissions trading market). Finally, the residual should correspond to the additional costs associated
with the development of renewables (C). The total revenue is equivalent to the total price of
renewables being split into the price of the TREC (B + C) and the spot price of electricity (A).
Should the governments consider splitting the TREC into its component parts, so as to allow trading
of the CO2 savings (B) to occur on the emissions trading market? Would this separation between CO2
emission reductions from renewable energy investment and the RE obligation lead to a more effective
CO2 emissions allowance market? How would the two markets be linked? We consider these
questions in the next section.
Should Renewable Energy Certificates be traded for GHG Emission Allowances?
To the extent that CO2 costs are internalized into the wholesale electricity price, the value of a TREC
will then represent the additional costs for producing renewables, excluding the carbon
improvement. Assuming that carbon costs are reflected in the wholesale electricity price, a
renewable (or nuclear or hydro) producer who sells at the market price will receive a premium for its
electricity that covers the carbon abatement resulting from the marginal production of non-carbon
electricity. In this case, the TREC would just represent A, so there is no CO2 component left to link.
CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
If future climate change policies limit the emissions of greenhouse gases at the global level, then the
energy systems will experience major changes. One would expect on the one hand important
consequences for energy consumption and, on the other hand, significant shifts in the primary and
final energy mix , towards a use of lower carbon intensive sources and technologies. Nevertheless,
the intensity of these shifts will depend on the costs associated with carbon emissions.
The impact of tradable emission allowances on the power sector is expected to change investment
trends, as a consequence of altered operating costs. If the CO2 price is above 25 per tonne of CO2 ,
the expected outcomes include new gas-fired technologies (CGGT) replacing fully amortized coal
plants, retirement of most inefficient carbon intensive power plants, development of the least costly
renewable energy plants, co-firing investments in fossil fuel plants and possibly a strong nuclear
revival depending on the political climate.
If CO2 emission prices are between 19 and  25 per tonne of CO2, there should be a reordering in the
merit order of coal and gas-fired technologies (CCGT) based on short-run marginal costs. Companies
are expected to arbitrage between running their existing coal plant or their CCGT plants. The plants
ranking on the merit order is sensitive to fuel prices and the plants efficiency rate. Without carbon
emission prices, gas prices have to decline to approximately 2.2/GJ before CCGT plants are as
competitive as coal plants on the short-run. However, with the introduction of a carbon emission cost,
the coal plants competitiveness is eroded since coal plants emit twice the amount of CO2 than
combined cycle gas turbines. Nevertheless, the effect of the carbon constraint depends on the degree
to which the carbon emission costs are integrated in market prices.
If prices are in the range of 5-19 per tonne of CO2, the current price range in Europe , the
consequences of a carbon emission price are likely to be limited. The carbon emission price will scale
up the costs of power generation on the wholesale market; however, no switch in the ranking is
expected except at the margins, and if gas prices drop relatively to coal. The introduction of a carbon
constraint would therefore only have marginal effects on investment decisions.
Elements which might exert Upward Pressure on CO2 Emission Prices:
Allocation methodologies and stringency of the emission reduction targets. The impact of
carbon emission constraints for wholesale power markets could be profound and will depend
heavily on allocation decisions. The number of allowances distributed to the installations
participating in the emissions trading market will determine the stringency of the emission
reductions target and their burden of costs. If installations receive a limited number of
allowances for free, they will have to buy the rest on the market. This might place an upward
pressure on the CO2 price;
The treatment of new entrants. If governments require that new entrants cover their
emissions on the market (paid entry), the number of players on the demand-side of the
emissions trading market will increase. This will exert upward pressure on the price of
allowances. On the other hand, free allocation to new entrants would require a reserve to be

23.2 per tonne of CO2 is the CO2 emission price resulting from the plants assumptions.
made out of the original allocation, so price impacts of allocation treatment of new entrants
may not be very significant;
Ability of companies to reduce their emissions. Because it is such a large emitter, the
energy sector is generally seen as having a key role in reducing GHG emissions. When,
however, the power installations have gone through most cost-effective emission abatement
investments, they might decide to purchase needed allowances on the market which will in
turn increase the demand for allowances;
Phasing-out of nuclear. Nuclear presents many advantages in terms of price stability,
indigenous supply and CO2 emissions although it also raises other environmental concerns.
Nuclear power produces 35 per cent of the European Union's electricity without producing
carbon dioxide. However, the policies of a number of EU countries - including Germany,
Belgium and Sweden - have opted to phase out nuclear power stations. This decision could
have substantial consequences on the costs of carbon emission mitigation;
Higher than expected economic growth, driving up industrial output.
Downward Pressure on CO2 Prices would come from Several Factors:
Renewable Energy Obligations. In several countries, power companies are mandated to
produce or hold a certain share of total output from renewable energy (RE) sources and must
redeem certificates to the regulator testifying that they have done so. The renewable energy
obligation policy ought to reduce the demand for allowances. Companies which decide to
build these technologies as an option to meet their renewable energy targets will benefit from
less carbon emissions. Certain fossil fuel technologies will be displaced on the spot market
considering that certain renewable technologies are as competitive as fossil fuel plants on the
short run. The green quota will therefore help lower emissions and consequently function
indirectly as an emission quota, although the amount of emissions displaced is uncertain.
The case of Accession countries in the EU ETS. The inclusion of additional players such as
EU Accession countries in the emission trading market would reduce the cost of emissions
trading by giving access to more cost-effective. Those countries also already have surplus
allowances since they have exceeded their Kyoto commitments as a consequence of their
economic decline in the 1990s. Their presence in the EU emissions trading scheme could put
a downward pressure on the CO2 emissions price;
Flexibility mechanisms: CDM and JI. The inclusion of CERs66 and ERUs67 in the trading
schemes will let imported allowances enter the market. The inclusion of these projects would
put downward pressure on CO2 emission prices due to the anticipated access to more costeffective emission reduction projects available outside the EU. In the case of the EU ETS,
there may be some limit to the use of CDM and JI credits. A review will be triggered once the
number of credits converted for use in the EU emissions trading scheme reaches 6 per cent of
the total quantity of allowances allocated by the Member States for the 2008-2012 period. The
See Carbon Market Europe Report for quoted prices (bids on the EU market are at 10 per tonne of CO2).
ERs are certified emission reductions. Tradable emission reductions generated by CDM projects undertaken in
developing countries, to be certified in order to be transferable.
RUs are emission reduction units. Tradable emission reductions generated by joint implementation projects.
outcome of such a discussion may, for example, be a quantitative limit of 8 per cent for the
remainder of the Kyoto Period, according to the proposal. The downward pressure would thus
be constrained.
The possibility to bank allowances during the commitment periods will give installations some
intertemporal flexibility in their decisions regarding allowances. If companies are able to operate
below the allocated emission cap, they can arbitrate between selling credits from any underutilization
in the market and banking them to off-set future emissions. Likewise, companies facing high emission
constraints will be authorized to borrow allowances from other companies. This should allow
companies to reduce the risk associated to CO2 price volatility and smooth the CO2 emission price
volatility.
The Decision to Pass on Carbon Emission Costs:
Carbon emission costs could have an impact on power companies business and financial profiles.
Installations with an emission cap could be negatively affected if they are unable to pass these costs
through the end-users. However, the decision to pass on the carbon emission costs or only part of it
depends on several factors. The most important elements are market competition, price elasticity of
the demand and available generating capacity on the market.
In power markets with tight capacity, competitive pressure from extra available capacity will be low.
In this case, companies which emit CO2 will be encouraged to fully feed their carbon costs through
their prices. Wholesale prices of electricity are expected to rise by 27 per cent in Europe if carbon
emission costs were to be fully passed on to the generators prices. However, countries will be
affected differently since some EU countries are more carbon intensive than others (see Appendix 1
for details).
However, there are several exceptions to price feed through of carbon emission costs:
In the case where prices are regulated;
In the case of international competition;
Updating allocation based on output  including between trading periods;
Market power.
Will the ETS affect the Power Generators Differently?
Existing nuclear power plants are likely to become highly valuable with the introduction of a carbon
emission constraint. They will benefit from higher wholesale prices without bearing additional costs.
Their main challenge will be to prolong their lives.
Coal power producers should plan which investments will occur when their emission caps are
implemented and their response will depend on CO2 prices. At high CO2 prices, they should manage
the retirement of their plants or consider operational measures such as co-firing with biomass and
improving the plants ability to supply on shoulder or peak capacity and not just run on baseload. One
way to remain in the coal-firing technologies would be to get subsidies for clean coal technologies,
although such technologies are not yet economic.
Gas power producers are expected to benefit from the introduction of CO2 price, although obtaining
high returns will depends on several factors. Of primary importance will be the access to gas supply
and the price of the fuel. This will depend on their ability to sign long term contracts under favorable
terms.
Will the ETS affect the Investment Signal?
In a simple economic analysis, the presence of a carbon emission cost in itself would not adversely
affect the overall investment volumes, since the profitability of producing electricity would remain at
the same level as without the ETS. The cost of allowances would be reflected in wholesale prices and
be considered as an operating cost.
However, in practice investment signals may be distorted in a number of ways. The investment signal
in new plants depends on several factors. Incentives for shutting plants down are of primary
importance. Companies which are due to shut down an inefficient carbon emitting plant in one
commitment period but would not receive the corresponding allowances in the next trading period
may decide to delay the plants closure. This could prevent investment in new plants and have a
negative signal on the market. Details of the national allocation plans also have an impact on new
investment decisions. By forcing companies which invest in new plants to purchase allowances, then
the emission constraint might represent an entry barrier. On the other hand, allocating to new entrants
for free could penalise investment in capacity expansion for incumbents.
Will the ETS affect the Technology Choice when Investing?
What is expected to occur with the implementation of an ETS is a change in where the profits can be
made. Emission trading will have an effect on the investment signals for different types of technology.
CCGT plants are likely to be the preferred option for new capacity additions in the future
environmental context. Their advantages in terms of emissions, efficiency, and costs compared to coal
facilities make it likely that companies will favour building gas plants against coal plants. Many highemissions plants such as old coal-fired ones which remain in operation may be required only for peaks
in demand or back-up of wind. This might therefore require investments to change their operating
patterns.
Is the CO2 value likely to be an Incentive to build new Renewable and Nuclear Capacity?
Compared to coal power plants, nuclear and renewable technologies do not have to invest in
purchasing allowances. However, the current costs of renewable energy make these technologies less
competitive than coal or CCGT plants. The question is whether the introduction of a price for carbon
emission could improve the attractiveness of investments in such power plants, and whether the
emission trading scheme might change the generation mix in participating countries:
Ranking of permits between each commitment period in the EU ETS is not yet clearly stated, leaving some
flexibility to governments.
The limits of wind power. The share of wind power is becoming larger as a result of an
improving cost position and subsidies from governments69. With the introduction of an
emission cap, its competitiveness could improve, but to be as competitive as CCGT plants, the
CO2 price would need to range between 30 and 116 per tonne of CO2 (see Chapter 2 Section
1 for more detail on assumptions). Moreover, the cost of wind power does not only include its
capital and operating costs. The full cost of wind is higher because wind is unreliable and
cannot be counted on for time of peak demand, when it is most needed. Therefore,
conventional capacity would be needed to back up wind-generation capacity, adding to its
cost. The level of these additional costs will depend on whether new conventional power
plants must be built or whether existing plants can play this role. Coal plants which are
expected to retire because of a carbon emission constraint could continue to generate
electricity when wind power is insufficient. This would thus reduce the additional costs for
wind power, although investments might be necessary to give the coal plant flexibility;
Biomass and other renewable energy. Biomass might also contribute to lowering carbon
emissions. However its share would only grow to a limited extent because the costs of this
technology are relatively high except for co-firing (see Annex 4). The price of carbon
emissions would have to range from 140 to 245 a tonne of CO2, depending on the amount
of operating costs for the technology to be as competitive as CCGT. Other renewable
technologies such as solar and hydrogen-powered fuel cells might also increase their share.
But since their viability depends on technological breakthroughs, it is unrealistic to believe
that a carbon price will stimulate their construction in the short term;
Nuclear Power as a possible solution to reduce carbon emissions. Investment in nuclear
technology is currently more expensive than new CCGT power plants. Nuclear generation, in
contrast to CCGT has high capital costs and relatively low fuel and operating costs. Under our
price assumptions, carbon emission prices would need to reach approximately 26 per tonne
of CO2 for nuclear to be as competitive as CCGT (see Annex 2 for details). This breakeven
price will be sensitive to specific plant costs. For example, the full investment costs of nuclear
power plants in Finland and in France are as low as 22 per MWh compared to the 38.8 per
MWh found based on our assumptions. Nevertheless, economies of scale have tended to
favour very large plants resulting in a relatively large capital commitment to a single
construction project and thus associated investment risk. In most OECD countries, building of
new nuclear power plants have slowed down because of litigation, construction delays and
environment threats since the mid 1970s. If, however, solutions were found to security and
environmental issues, there could be a case for investing in nuclear. According to the Boston
Consulting Group, between 2012 and 2020, after 40 years of operation, 25 GW of prime baseload capacity is due to be closed in Europe. The lost capacity would put further pressure on
the power generation industry, increasing the demand for gas. Nevertheless, investments in
existing nuclear power plants to extend their life time could temporarily postpone this
pressure on the capacity market.

Will the Emission Trading Scheme raise a Barrier to Entry, thereby Discouraging New
Investments?
Several methods exist for the allocation of allowances within an emissions trading scheme , the main
ones being auctioning, grandfathering, and updating (Harrison and Radov, 2002, Burtraw et al.,
2002). In these three methods, emissions are capped. However, another allocation mode exists in
which total emissions are not capped. This mode is based on a fixed carbon emission per output (e.g.
kWh):
In the case of auctions, participants in the trading system have to purchase the allowances to
cover their expected emissions. The returns of the auction could then be recycled back into the
economy, for example by means of reducing various tax rates. One of the advantages of
auctioning allowances is that it avoids the difficult negotiation of source-by-source
allocations. Instead, each source decides how many allowances it needs to buy to cover its
projected emissions, and bid for these allowances on the marketplace;
In the case of grandfathering, the distribution of allowances is free of charge and is based on
the past emissions levels. The base period or historical emissions principle starts from
emissions in a chosen period, either one reference year or the average over several years.
Nowadays, the term grandfathering refers also to distributions using external benchmarks,
for instance regarding emissions per unit of output71;
A third approach is updating, in which allowances are also distributed free of charge to
entities, and the emission cap is fixed during the whole period. Each entitys allocation is
updated between trading periods on the basis of its activity level measured by a given metric
such as industrial output. Such a method of allocation offers the opportunity to give firms
additional allowances when they are needed;
A fourth approach is a fixed carbon emission intensity. The difference between this allocation
mode and the other three lies in the fact that total emissions are not capped during the
commitment period. Companies can produce a variable amount of emissions as long as they
fulfil the carbon intensity constraint.
The choice of initial allocation has important effects on the efficiency and overall cost of a trading
programme. According to Burtraw and al. (2001), the auction is significantly more cost-effective than
the other approaches  roughly one half of the societal cost of grandfathering or updating. The
differences in the cost of the three approaches flow from the effect of each approach on electricity
price.
The allocation mode used in European carbon dioxide emissions trading scheme is closer to the updating
allocation mode than pure grandfathering. This is because emission caps are fixed for each commitment period but can be
revised and modified for the following commitment period. In contrast, pure grandfathering means allocating emissions for a
lasting period as it was the under the US Acid Rain Program. In this program, SO2 emissions were allocated to the emitters
for a period of 30 years. In the EU, the allocation mode is free (up to 95 per cent) and bench marking is not excluded.
The benchmark principle uses some kind of standard representing an equal position for all installations in a sector
or subgroup.
A fundamental question regarding investments in the power sector relates to the treatment of new
plants . The issue here is whether new entrants (new generators which enter the power market and
incumbents who build new plants) might be discouraged to enter the power market because of the
allocation mode which covers their emissions. Will they be allocated part of their allowances for free
as the incumbents in case of grandfathering or will they have to purchase all allowances to cover their
emissions (either from the market or by auction), which might be seen as a disadvantage in terms of
competitiveness:
A barrier to entry? The choice between auctioning versus free allocation for new
installations will have an impact on the number of new investments and on the raising of entry
barriers. If incumbents are allocated their allowance free of charge (grandfathering) and
owners of new plants have to buy the allowances, new entrants costs will include the price of
allowances. They will not be able to compete on the market unless the price pays for the
allowances. This could discourage the building of new plants. If new entrants receive, as the
incumbents, the allowances free of charge73, then competition will be fully exercised. The
decision to invest should not be restricted by the emission trading scheme. On the other hand,
free allocation to new entrant could be seen as distorting the investment signals in relation to
expansion of capacity in existing plant, where new allowances would need to be purchased. It
will be important for policy makers to minimise these distortions, and much will rest on how
new entrants are defined and treated in the scheme;
The allocation of free allowances is one way to cover additional investment risks. The
uncertainty concerning the CO2 price and future allocation of allowances, would drive the
investment risk premium and thus make the investment more expensive; and this would not be
reflected in the electricity price. The level of free allowances to new plants, given that it is an
investment incentive, must, however, be very carefully considered. This would reduce barriers
to entry but could complicate the investment signals for incumbents. If it were too high, it
would create a boom-and-bust behaviour in the industry.
An incentive for higher power prices? The choice between auctioning versus free
allocation for new plants will have an impact on the behaviour of insiders. Whether the latter
will actually reduce their price premiums with the arrival of new competitors  the difference
between prices and marginal costs  depends on the treatment of new entrants in the trading
scheme. If incumbents are allocated their allowance free of charge (grandfathering) and
owners of new plants have to buy the allowances, the price premiums will not be decreased.
Incumbents, therefore, do not have any incentive to pass on the subsidy in the prices74 and
will receive a free transfer of wealth. If new plants receive, as the incumbents do, the
allowances free of charge, then competition in the market can result in a decline of the price
premiums. In this case, the price of allowances does not fully appear in the new entrants
costs. The latter will be able to supply against an unchanged market price;
It is important to keep in mind that the new entrants issue is of a transitory character. What is a new entrant in one
trade period will be an existing installation in the subsequent period and be treated in the same manner as all other existing
installations. Moreover, it may be quite difficult to distinguish real new entrants from incumbents that want to expand
generation capacity.
This could be done if countries chose to build a reserve of allowances for new entrants.
Mannaerts, H. and Mulder, M. (2003): Emissions Trading and the European Electricity Market, Consequences of
emissions trading on prices of electricity and competitiveness of basic industries, CPB Memorandum, Netherlands.
Consequences of a non harmonised allocation mode in participating countries. The nonharmonisation of allocation modes for new entrants will have implications on the choice of
investment location of the new operators. If some countries require that market entry must be
paid for while other countries allocate allowance free of charge, new investments are likely to
be implemented in the countries where allowances are grandfathered. New entrants who have
paid for their entry should suffer from this competitive disadvantage compared to those who
did not bear this incremental cost.
Discouraging Early Actions?
Once allocation plans have been established for a committed period, the allocations cannot be
modified during that time. This anchoring is expected to bring credibility to the system in the short
term, and incentives to reduce emissions if abatement costs are below the carbon market price.
However, long-term decisions will be exposed to national plans revisions. This issue is particularly
important for power plant retrofitting. If a power company decides to switch fuel (e.g. from coal to
gas), it would benefit from the allocation based on historically high emissions. Whether the company
would be able to hold these benefits for several trading periods is not known. This uncertainty could
delay abatement measures since companies might wait until this uncertainty is resolved.
Will the Regulatory Uncertainty Delay Investments?
Uncertainty regarding the stringency of the allocation plans may delay investment decisions. The
stringency of a countrys cap-and-trade regime will depend on the emissions of the sectors which are
not covered by the scheme and the economic growth rate of the country. The main issue has to do
with the forecasted growth of emissions from the transport and household sectors, both of which are
not covered by the cap. Since a countrys cap is determined by the sum each sectors emissions, if the
transport sector has a very rapid growth rate thereby increasing its share in the total emissions, other
sectors may bear this increase. Likewise, if emission reductions are made in other sectors, the capped
sectors may benefit from these reductions. Stringency on the power sector is therefore expected to
result partly from the other sectors emissions. The level of stringency will nonetheless depend on the
policies and measures applied to the transport and household sector, and the efforts made in these
sectors to mitigate emissions.
Uncertainty also arises from the opening - or not - of the emissions trading market to Russia and
Ukraine. Several conditions need to be met if Russia and Ukraine decided to participate to an
emission trading market. Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is of primary importance. Secondly,
those countries would have to meet the eligibility requirements to trade. The eligibility requirements
in the Marrakech Accords specify that Parties that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol should have in
place national systems for estimation of emissions and sinks of greenhouse gases, inventory systems
for recording these, and that it is in compliance with the procedures for reporting of these emissions,
sinks and assigned amounts. Countries that are in compliance with these requirements would be given
a well-defined allocation of AAUs . Finally, if these countries decided to trade their AAUs on the
European ETS, for example, bilateral agreements between those countries and the EU would have to
be signed.
Also called assigned amount units. Permission to emit one tonne of CO2 equivalent. The initial sum of a Partys
allowances is its assigned amount, or allocation.
If only the first two requirements were met, a dual trading market could emerge. The EU 25 ETS, on
one side, could limit its access and allow trade only within its borders. Trade with the rest of the
world including Russia and Ukraine, would be limited and would represent a second market.
If all of the conditions were met, and the EU emission trading market was open to the rest of the
world, this may have perverse consequences and have a critical impact on the stringency of the
targets. The possibility of including Russia and Ukraine in the emissions trading scheme would reduce
the cost of meeting emission caps by giving access to more cost-effective and therefore cheaper ways
of reducing emissions. If no limit is imposed on the inclusion of hot air, the quantity of quotas
allocated above the countries actual emissions would lead to a downward pressure on CO2 prices. For
a sustainable outcome therefore, the amount of hot air included in any linked trading schemes would
have to be carefully controlled and any Russian ET scheme would need to include allocation rules
with similar restrictions as specified in the EU scheme in Annexe 3 . The discussion about ways in
which to manage treatment of hot air is also linked to the development of a Green In vestment
Scheme (GIS) .
Given the uncertainty about whether the Kyoto Protocol will be ratified and what will happen after
2012 if it is ratified, companies may decide not to invest immediately in new power plant technologies
or abatement costs. Power companies may chose to delay their investments or the closure of their
most inefficient plants until they know how rigorously the Kyoto accord is going to be implemented.
Understanding how the market might develop both at the international and at the national level will
determine the risk exposure of companies. Without resolution of these unknowns, it is likely that
investments in new gas supplies, gas infrastructure and power plants may be deferred. Regulators
could solve this investment delay by doing what they can to shape policy and regulation issues are
soon as possible.
Introducing an emissions trading scheme is not expected to adversely impact on overall investments,
although it could change the technology choice for new plants. However, the uncertainty surrounding
the trading market currently seems to cause definite hesitance to invest in the market. As described
above, these unknowns may delay investments. In the power sector, plants which are currently built
will be expected to still be operating in 20-30 years. It will not be possible to remove regulatory
uncertainties over these timescales, but a trading market should help to transfer the regulatory risk to a
market price of carbon which should be easier to manage through options, futures, etc. Emission
trading provides additional flexibility to power companies compared to other regulatory measures
such as emission standards. Nevertheless, in the early stages of the carbon market, these risks will be
relatively high, and could affect investments. Whereas it is clear that the risk will be lower once the
market has settled down, the remaining risk should not be underestimated. The fact that there will be
ongoing new allocations and targets mean that investors will only have a short (three to four years for
the first and second commitment periods) foresight into ETS (which will be the potentially most
important value driver) when they commit themselves to a 20-30 year investment.
In Annex 3 Criteria for National Allocation Plans, article 1 stipulates that The total quantity of allowances to be
allocated shall not be more than is likely to be needed for the strict application of the criteria of this Annex.
Green Investment Schemes are developed as a way of managing hot air in AAU transactions. For additional details
see Bltyh, Baron (2003): Green Investment Schemes: Options and Issues, OCED/IEA AIXG, Paris.
Is the Emissions Trading Scheme a (Re)distribution of Wealth?
Overall, whatever the allocation mode, creating a cap and trade regime imposes costs on the producers
and consumers of electricity and gas. At a given cap level, there is a given price impact on consumers,
regardless of what share of permits are allocated freely to producers.
Consumers will bear electricity price increases from two sources (carbon emission costs and increased
gas prices in the long run due to increased demand for gas from the power sector). This consequence
might cancel out the price decrease as a result of the electricity deregulation movement. Therefore, the
free allocation of permits to producers acts as a transfer of rents from government/taxpayer to the
producers. One solution could be to have companies pay for allowances through auctions.
Governments would then have to decide how to distribute the income from the auction which in itself
would have distributional effects. In addition, these distributional effects should ideally be taken into
account when designing CO2 or energy tax structures.

APPENDIX 1
EUROPEAN POWER GENERATION AND RELATED EMISSIONS
The power sector is the primary CO2 emitter in the European Union, representing 31.4 per cent of the
European Unions total CO2 emissions . Nonetheless, large disparities exist among EU countries. In
countries such as Denmark, Germany, Greece and Finland the share of the power sector in total CO2
emissions is above the EU15 average. The impact of emission trading on the power sector will thus be
considerably higher in those countries than in countries such as France and Sweden.

Table 15 shows the disparities among European countries based on the share of fossil fuels in their
generation mix. The question is whether some countries will undergo more carbon cost than others,
and whether this will lead to possible competitiveness implications if a carbon value is added to
electricity prices, considering that companies might transfer the value of their carbon costs on the
market prices.
The Power Sector includes Public Electricity and Heat Production and Unallocated Autoproducers.
In comparison, the transport sector is the second emitter accounting for 26 per cent of the EU total.

The burden of a carbon constraint depends on the share of fossil fuels in power generation. There are
significant differences in fuel mix across EU countries. The share of fossil fuel plants in Denmark,
Ireland and Greece for example, is high above the EU average. The impact of CO2 allowances will
henceforth be greater than in countries where the generation mix is essentially based on hydro or
nuclear technologies. However, to consider neighbouring countries are direct competitors implies that
there are no transmission and interconnection constraints between the power markets. Nonetheless, in
the European Union, interconnection capacity is a significant issue. The European power market is
fragmented into several regional markets, the boundaries of which are driven by limitations in
transmission interconnections. Some Member States are relatively isolated with very limited
capacities with neighbouring countries. For example, Italian electricity imports from France must
transmit through Switzerland, a country whose grid capacity is often constrained. Therefore, due to
inadequate transmission capacity, Italy is unable to import from France the total amount of less
carbon intensive electricity requested.
According to the European Commission, the European electricity system may be considered as
consisting of one core area: the central European market (which stretches from France to borders of
Italy and takes in Germany, Austria and the Benelux countries), and six satellites (the Iberian
Peninsula, Italy, Great Britain, Scandinavia/Nordel, Ireland/Northern Ireland and Greece). The four
largest satellites all have a limited import capacity, the extreme case being Iberian Peninsula where
import capacity is only 2 per cent of the total capacity in the area, followed by the UK (3 per cent),
Scandinavia (4 per cent) and Italy (7 per cent). Among the core countries, there is a group of Member
States which have a degree of interconnection capacity of around 20 per cent or more (Denmark,
Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands), which are all relatively well connected with
surrounding markets. France and Germany are the two following Member States with an
interconnection level of around 10 per cent. Henceforth, the introduction of a carbon constraint may
not affect the countries competitiveness in terms of power prices as much as if there were no
interconnection capacity constraints.
Nevertheless, a carbon constraint will have implications on a plants competitiveness as not all
facilities emit the same amount of greenhouse gases. Depending on the price of the carbon, thermal
facilities will become less competitive than nuclear plants; and among fossil fuel plants, certain
technologies might become more competitive than others. The reason for this is that the carbon
intensity of conventional thermal generation differs largely from one country to another in the EU15
and from one company to another.
The carbon intensity for coal plants appear to vary greatly. The Danish, Finnish and Swedish plants
emit half the amount of CO2 per kWh than the French or Italian coal plants. Several reasons can be
invoked, the first of which is the average plants efficiency. In France, the baseload facilities are
essentially nuclear plants, running at maximum efficiency. The coal plants are the marginal units on
the market, operating as the shoulder producer. Their efficiency is therefore relatively low, leaving the
facilities with a higher carbon emission. In contrast, in Denmark, coal facilities run as baseload
capacity. Another reason lies in the plants lifetime. In Italy, coal plants are relatively old facilities
compared to Swedish or Danish plants. Refurbishment investments must still be made, leaving the
carbon intensity of those plants high. A similar argument can be invoked for the oil plants. Finally, in
the Nordic countries, a number of CHP plants run on coal. This allows those plants to benefit form a
high efficiency rate, lessening the carbon intensity of the plants.
It is important to note that the impact of a CO2 constraint on the European power companies
competitiveness would have been limited if the deregulation movement had not been introduced. The
main reason is that under the previous regulation, there was no competition between electricity
companies. Each utility was in a position of local monopoly. However, the creation of a single
European power market implies that companies with very different fuel mixes are now in competition.
APPENDIX 2
LONG-RUN MARGINAL COST ASSUMPTIONS
FOR A NEW NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
The published estimates of nuclear costs vary widely, so for our nuclear scenario, assumptions were
made which take a mid-point of these costs where possible. The average fuel costs used in the
calculations were 6.65 per MWh (compared to a range from 2.3/MWh in Canada to 14.8/MWh in
Japan), and the variable and fixed maintenance costs of the plants were assumed to be 9.1 per MWh
taken from the OECD (IEA/NEA) report of 1998. On decommissioning, the OECD 1998 report
provides discounted costs at 10 per cent discount rate ranging from 1 to 4 $/kWe. For our
assumptions, the decommissioning costs are 0.27 per MWh assuming a discounted cost of $2 per
kWe. The cost of capital reaches 22.8 per MWh, assuming that the capital cost totals 1700$ per kW,
the plant availability rate equals 85 per cent and the plant size is 1200 MW. Therefore, for the
assumed new power plant, the long-run marginal costs reach 38.85 per MWh.
The full investment cost of a nuclear plant depends on a number of assumptions such as the interest
rate, plant availability, etc. The LRMC found below is not country specific, and therefore does not
represent the investment costs of nuclear plants in France nor in Finland where these can reach around
22 per MWh in the latter. The capital cost is highly sensitive to the type of nuclear plan built and the
size of the plant. For example, in the French DGEMP report , the capital cost is as low as 1043  per
kW for a new series of European Pressurised Reactors. In the report, the capital cost contribution is
lower than 20 per MWh (around 17-18  per MWh). On the other hand, a recent MIT study assumes
that capital cost of a nuclear plant reaches 2000$ per kW . The cost effectiveness of the nuclear
technologies (including the effects of carbon price i.e. the breakeven CO2 price) compared to other
technologies will depend on specific plant costs.

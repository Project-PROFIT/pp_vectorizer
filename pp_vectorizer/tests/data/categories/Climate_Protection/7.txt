Climate Change & the Financial Sector:
An Agenda for Action
A publication of Allianz Group and WWF
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Executive Summary
1. Climate change is real
Climates have always been changing. But this
time there is one big difference: the changes are
principally man-made. The issue has become
urgent because the pace of change is accelerating.
This report identifies actions for key stakeholders: Allianz Group, its clients, co-financiers and
policymakers.
Europe is not only warming 40 percent faster
than the world as a whole, but has already sustained severe damage from climate change. Storms
in 1999 and floods in 2002 each cost 13 billion
euros, while a heat wave in 2003 cost 10 billion
euros. Although no precise estimate of all future
costs can be made, a European Commission paper
puts the future cost of all the potential cumulative
global damage at 74 trillion euros at todays value
if effective action is not taken.
Climate change will have a multitude of effects
on human society and on nature if we fail to take
clear actions to slow it down. While milder winters may seem an attractive proposition for Europeans, it is a prospect that deceives. Climate
change will lead to increased heat stress, a rise in
insect-borne diseases, and increases in rates of
skin cancer and food poisoning. Globally, climate
change already results in about 160,000 deaths a
year, and this is likely to rise sharply because of
increasing shortages of food and water.
The extraordinary heat wave in 2003 caused
27,000 deaths in Europe and disrupted agriculture, inland shipping, and electricity production.
Huge swathes of forests covering a total of 5 percent of Portugals surface area were destroyed in a
loss put at one billion euros.
By the end of this century such a summer
could be routine. Mediterranean agriculture
might be in a state of collapse. Everywhere in
Europe rainfall will be more intense. The number
of major floods in Europe has already risen from
one per year to 15 in recent decades. In the UK,
the annual cost of flooding this century will rise
to as much as 30 billion euros. Businesses are
increasingly reporting reduced profitability because of unusual weather. Many European Union
holiday destinations will suffer  in a region
where travel and tourism generate about 4 percent of GDP.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. Climate change policies are
changing the economics
Governments are starting to introduce policies to
tackle the causes and combat the effects of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and these policies will
alter the economics of entire industries. They will
affect company share prices, both positively and
negatively. Examples from industry show that
proactive strategies tackling CO2 emissions reap
economic benefits. And climate change might not
be the only reason for taking such steps. Other
benefits of climate change policy might include
reducing dependence on energy imports, achieving more reliable energy price levels, ensuring
clean air, and creating jobs. The growth of carbon
markets associated with emissions entitlements
offers revenue opportunities for developing countries and more efficient companies, and will
need a range of services from the financial sector.
International emissions trading could be worth
between 50 and 800 billion euros in 2025.
Climate change policies will have an effect on
a number of industry sectors. The most sensitive
sectors are either energy-intensive, such as cement,
aviation, metals or energy industries such as oil
and gas, coal, power utilities; or provide energyconsuming products such as automobiles.
The driving force behind much of the current
carbon market activity is the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Some of the early warnings of
huge effects in certain sectors seem unlikely now,
but the current market price has climbed to over
20 euros per tonne of CO2 (May 30) which is not
negligible.
There has been a steady flow of research
reports looking into the issue of carbon constraints on corporate earnings since 2002. They
demonstrate that there are clear differences in the
present value of corporate earnings, across a range
of possible future climate policy scenarios. This
means that managements and investors cannot
assume that there will be time to react to policy
when it is approaching implementation.
A WWF study found that certain electricity
companies could face costs of as much as 9 per-
6 Climate Change
cent of gross earnings, though costs may be
passed on, while low-cost producers can extract
larger margins. A Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW) study concluded that 8 out of 18
cement companies were overvalued by up to
13 percent.
3. Financial sectors need for
consistent, long-term policy
frameworks
To combat the negative effects of climate change
consensus exists that the global average temperature should not increase by more than 2 degrees
Celsius and rather stay below this threshold.
This will imply a cut in annual GHG emissions
of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 globally, from the
current level of almost 7 billion tonnes of carbon
to under 2.5 billion. In line with these targets,
individual EU member states have already
announced national greenhouse gas reduction
goals that support a path of deep and consistent
reductions. For example, France proposes a 75 percent reduction by 2050, the UK a 60 percent cut by
2050, and Germany is considering a 40 percent
cut by 2020. However, specific actions are rarely
defined beyond a horizon of 2012, the conclusion
of the first Kyoto commitment period.
Early action is needed to provide greater certainty for business, long-term investment and
technological change. Inconsistent policies or no
policies at all simply deter investment. Among
the inconsistencies: the EU subsidized fossil fuels
by 24 billion euros in 2004 compared to 5.3 billion euros for renewable energy sources; and
international transport fuel is tax-exempt. The
best strategy would involve a mix of actions on
energy efficiency, including conservation measures, renewable energy and switching to low CO2
fuel and gases. Perhaps half of the potential growth
in emissions could be saved by greater energy
efficiency.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
4. New risks and new demands for
financial services companies
The financial services industry needs to adapt its
internal processes and policies and its products
and services to meet the challenges its clients face
as well as to safeguard its own viability. To enable
financial services companies to play a responsible
role in mitigating climate change they require a
reliable, transparent and international co-ordinated policy framework as well as long term, appropriated CO2-reduction goals. That gives certainty
for investment decisions and provides business
opportunities for clients.
In order to adapt their own operations to the
new challenge, financial services companies should
include climate change risk in their internal governance procedures, in line with the existing
financial corporate risk identification, controlling
and reporting structures and best practice in
reporting requirements.
INSURANCE
Climate change and climate policy affect insurers
through the risks they accept from clients. Since
climate experts predict changes in the intensity
and distribution of extreme weather events (especially water-related and storms), and because of
the resultant risk of catastrophic property claims,
insurers are likely to regard climate change as a
threat rather than an opportunity. The high number of tropical storms worldwide pushed insured
weather losses in 2004 to a record 32 billion
euros. While the incidence of tropical storms is
not conclusively linked to climate change, their
increased frequency is part of a pattern of higher
activity.
Projections for the UK from the Association of
British Insurers suggest that by 2050 the annual
cost of weather claims will double to 3.3 billion
euros, while an extreme year might cost 20 billion
euros. In Germany the total exposure to flood
damage in one event might be 15 billion euros.
Climate change is increasing the potential for
property damage at a rate of between 2 and 4 percent a year. Because insurance pricing relies on
historical data, this could lead to an underpricing
of weather risks by as much as 30 percent due to
the time lag between the historic data that is used
to set prices, and the future period in which
claims will occur. In Allianzs global industrial
insurance business for example, around 35 to
40 percent of insured losses are already due to
natural catastrophes  mainly floods and storms 
so this could materially affect the overall profitability of insurers. Other effects are expected to
include claims for loss of sales, heat stress among
clients or staff, damage to vehicles, travel delays,
and pollution from floods.
But climate change will also bring more
demand for conventional risk transfer and open
opportunities in new areas such as emission
reduction projects.
Insurers Agenda for Action:
 Gather information on future climate risks and
thereby better predict and underwrite climateassociated risks.
 Control their exposure to natural catastrophes
and other climate-related risks by developing
adequate risk assessment tools such as flood
zoning and establishing expertise for natural
catastrophes.
 Upgrade risk assessment methodologies such
as identifying potential new liabilities from
carbon emission or using environmental due
diligence screening of a company.
 Develop risk management expertise regarding
low carbon technologies jointly with industrial
clients to develop new products supportive of
low carbon technology.
BANKING
Banks play an important role in climate-related
financing and investment, credit risk management, and the development of new climate risk
hedging products. On the downside, they face
credit risks because policies to cut emissions can
create costs for carbon intensive sectors and companies. Price volatility in carbon markets (CO2,
oil, gas, coal) and climate-related commodities
leads to uncertainty in financial projections. For
Climate Change 7
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
example, the price of CO2 varied between 5 and
20 euros per tonne in the two years to June 2005.
But climate change also creates opportunities.
According to the World Energy Council, the
renewable energy market could be worth 1.4 trillion euros by 2020. The global carbon market in
2010 could be worth up to 200 billion euros, estimates Point Carbon. Exploiting the Kyoto Mechanisms could enhance project returns by up to 15
percentage points e.g. in methane reduction projects. Weather derivatives offer potential to banks:
the total notional value of this market rose to 3.5
billion euros in 2003/04. Emission trading creates
new relationships between corporates: cross-border, cross-commodity, cross-product, and that in
an increasingly international context. Significant
new investments will be required internationally
in high value added technologies for both large
and small scale aspects for each project. A key
challenge here is to marry long-term investment
horizons with short-term regulatory change.
Banks Agenda for Action:
Banks taking leadership on climate change issues
will therefore need to
 Review and optimize their own carbon risk
management and (further) develop assessment
tools applied to carbon risks and carbon risk
reduction strategies (e.g. by using carbon related economic analysis for sectors or companies
and/or by developing climate change related
risk matrixes).
 Define clear risk requirements for clients
regarding carbon risk reduction and market
strategies (e.g. by discussing rating requirements with clients).
 Foster the development of carbon risk hedging
products e.g. derivatives.
 Facilitate finance for public programmes that foster the introduction of low carbon technologies.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
Climate change is one of the most financially significant environmental issues facing investors
today. It distinguishes itself in the fact that it has
implications for a number of sectors that are
exposed to policy-driven strategies to mitigate
climate change. Therefore, understanding to
what extent and how climate change will impact
or enhance the value of investments is crucial if
shareholder value is to remain protected. Although
there is increasing evidence to suggest that climate change considerations are starting to permeate into investor thinking, it is an issue that as
yet still lacks incorporation into mainstream
investment considerations. Barriers exist in the
lack of understanding of the implications and
uncertainty around climate change policy and
regulation which remain complex.
Furthermore, the availability of comparable
and consistent data on companies emissions levels, as well as tools to assess risks and opportunities remain limited. Looking at the asset management chain of responsibility  institutional
investors, consultants, fund managers, financial
analysts and companies  each face different
challenges. But what is clear is that each one of
them can take specific action, primarily to develop understanding and respective tools regarding
the financial implications of climate change.
Specifically, fund managers and financial analysts should:
 Evaluate their client portfolios for climate
change risks and opportunities in order to be
able to respond to changes in climate change
policy and legislation.
 Engage with company management to understand how climate change is impacting their
business and what strategies they are employing to minimize its risks or maximize opportunities from it; educate clients about the benefits
and processes being used to incorporate extrafinancial issues in the management of their
assets.
 Request and reward external research providers
e.g. brokers to produce consistent, quality, long-
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
term research, which incorporates extra-financial issues such as climate change and integrate
such issues into their mainstream analysis and
investment decisions also by utilizing the help
of their in-house or external SRI expertise.
5. Financing low-carbon energy
The solution to climate change is essentially to
convert the worlds economies to low-carbon technologies, through both alternative energies and
more efficient energy conversion. Low-carbon
energies can be a contribution to the mitigation
of GHG emissions and a business opportunity for
project developers and investors.
The future outlook for the low-carbon energy
market is promising. According to the International Energy Agency investment in cleaner energy at present is USD 20 billion a year, mainly to
solar and wind power, expected to grow to USD
100 billion globally within 10 years. Investment
in renewables and clean energy technology rose
150 percent between the years 2000 to 2004,
across a wide range of applications (efficiency,
windpower, fuel cells, etc.).
The growing market opens increasing opportunities for financial services providers.
However, renewable energy technologies, given
their innovative character, often face a number of
additional barriers compared to other projects,
e.g. technical problems or higher upfront costs.
Therefore it is necessary to develop specific
expertise and financial involvement in low-carbon energies and to diversify the risks of such
energy projects.
6. Adressing climate change is
5. crucial for the financial sector
Climate change will increase costs for the financial
sector if no action is taken. Banks and investors in
particular need a clear regulatory framework on
climate policy which they can adapt and base
their investment and lending decisions on, while
insurers face the prospect of heavy losses.
Integrated financial organisations need to be
aware that climate change could result in a compounding of risk across the entire business spectrum, diluting some of the benefits of diversification. For example, an insurer is exposed to
property losses from extreme events, but so too is
a property investor, and also a banker providing
services to the property management sector. Furthermore, if the insurer seeks to reduce his risk by
withdrawing cover, other stakeholders (investors,
bankers etc.) are left with greater, uninsured risks.
Therefore, integrated financial organizations
need to develop pro-active strategies to manage
the increasing risks due to climate change.

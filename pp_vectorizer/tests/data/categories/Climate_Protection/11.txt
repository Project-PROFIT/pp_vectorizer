FOREWORD
This document was prepared by the OECD and IEA Secretariats in September and October 2005 in
response to the Annex I Expert Group on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). The Annex I Expert Group oversees development of analytical papers for the purpose of
providing useful and timely input to the climate change negotiations. These papers may also be useful to
national policy-makers and other decision-makers. In a collaborative effort, authors work with the Annex I
Expert Group to develop these papers. However, the papers do not necessarily represent the views of the
OECD or the IEA, nor are they intended to prejudge the views of countries participating in the Annex I
Expert Group. Rather, they are Secretariat information papers intended to inform Member countries, as
well as the UNFCCC audience.
The Annex I Parties or countries referred to in this document are those listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC
(as amended at the 3rd Conference of the Parties in December 1997): Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Community, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, and United States of America. Korea and Mexico, as OECD member countries, also participate in
the Annex I Expert Group. Where this document refers to countries or governments, it is also intended
to include regional economic organisations, if appropriate.

1. Background and Objectives
At their March 2005 meeting, the AIXG delegates asked the Secretariat to investigate how different
approaches to climate change mitigation, undertaken by various countries, could be integrated in the
future. This paper is an attempt to shed some light on this question, define integration and explore its
rationale, its possible mechanisms and implications.
Integration may have at least two distinct purposes in this context. One could be to enhance synergies
between approaches adopted independently in different countries. Another could be to help the negotiating
process to take into account preferred approaches by various countries in establishing future agreements,
thus expanding efforts and participation. This paper addresses both purposes.
Approaches for future international action to mitigate climate change can be broadly classified into two
categories: those that place quantitative objectives for greenhouse gas emissions, and those that do not. The
first category itself divides into options for different target types, and options for different allocation
methods. The second category includes international coordination of policies and measures, of carbon
taxes, and international technology agreements (Philibert, 2005).
Published and unpublished work undertaken thus far under the AIXG auspices has focussed on options for
future quantitative objectives1, and international technology collaboration.2
Options for future commitment types were essentially considered in relation to emissions trading. Several
other AIXG papers examined various aspects of linkages between existing or developing systems.3 The
linking of various emissions trading systems is certainly one possible type of integration, but integration
can be broader, in particular when extended to fundamentally different approaches.
One aspect of integration may be how countries following different approaches with respect to their own
emissions could collaborate in helping other countries reducing their emissions, and how help to others
relates to the approaches taken by each country to mitigate its own emissions. For example, the Clean
Development Mechanism, supposed to help developing countries achieving sustainable development, is
based on the desire for Kyotos developed countries to search for cheaper emission reduction possibilities
in developing countries. Can it be integrated with support for technology transfers by industrialised
countries following another approach?
This paper discusses first the various arguments favouring integration, and the likely effects of various
possible forms of integration. As comparing approaches, either by comparison of efforts or comparison of
results, appears crucial to any form of integration, the paper then considers in more details how different
approaches can be compared, with respect to a countrys own emissions as well as to its action to help
other countries reduce theirs.

2. Reasons for Integration and Likely Effects
Integration may take place when objectives are set and policies adopted, so each countrys policy more or
less stems from an international negotiating process; integration may also take place at a later stage, when
national policies set up independently may be somewhat adapted to maximise synergetic effects at
international levels. Ex-ante and ex-post integration may be inspired by the same motives; however, they
may not entail exactly the same effects.
While one could think of various reasons for integrating different approaches, most if not all relate to the
presumption that this would create the necessary conditions for an eventual increase in the level of action.
The various arguments are the following:
The public good argument: climate stability is a public good. As such, it would be undersupplied
by agents and countries acting in isolation, for countries would aim at equalising their marginal
abatement cost with the marginal benefit they derive from their action alone. Provided free-riding
can be avoided, collective or integrated action would drive higher level of mitigation, for
countries would aim at equalising their marginal abatement cost with the (greater) marginal benefit
they derive from the action of all countries;
The competitiveness argument: Unilateral or uneven action against climate change may raise
concerns about companies competitiveness on global markets, and undermine emission reduction
efforts of these companies while entailing emission leakage. Integration may help alleviate these
concerns and facilitate increased level of action;
The fairness argument: Unilateral or uneven action may raise perception of unfairness which could
reduce policymakers and publics will to act; this argument may be compounded by the
considerations made above about competitiveness;
The static cost-effectiveness argument: If different approaches can be combined or linked in some
way, it may improve the cost of effectiveness of the combined regime by making the whole greater
than the sum of its parts. For example, integration of national emissions trading approaches, i.e.,
linking, could lead to greater economic efficiency and broader participation. It enhances economic
efficiency by expanding low cost reduction opportunities. It could expand participation by
reducing competitiveness concerns.4 It could also help enhance technology transfer in providing
some up-front financing for emission reductions in the countries part of the integrated scheme.
The dynamic cost-effectiveness argument: Some clean technologies still in their early development
would improve performances and reduce costs through learning by doing processes. Such
improvements may be greater and happen faster if markets are broader; as collaboration may
broaden these if approaches lead to broader participation and are linked. It could reduce mitigation
costs faster; collaboration may also help share information, research and development costs; lower
abatement costs would justify governments requiring lower emissions.
Benito Mller (2005) writes that significant surplus permits for the most populous developing countries  would
definitely not do the job of mitigating concerns about competitiveness and leakage, since, by definition, surplus
permits do not impose a mitigation cost. However, even surplus emission rights could, with proper domestic policy,
create an opportunity cost for emissions. Such costs would certainly not affect the profitability of the companies in
countries with surplus emissions as they may in countries short in emission allowances, but it would still deter
increases in activity and emissions in the former countries, i.e. leakage, as a consequence of the carbon constraint.
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
The technology transfer argument: Mitigating climate change will require improved or breakthrough clean technologies; most are in the hands of industrialised countries; collaboration
between industrialised and developing countries help disseminating them more widely; integration
of industrialised countries efforts could lead to more technology transfers as the public good
argument applies in this context as well.
How do these various arguments relate to each other? Obviously there are numerous synergies between
them. Collaboration may simultaneously increase level of action, as suggests the public good argument, as
a result of alleviating concerns for competitiveness, leakage or unfairness, in reducing short term and long
term costs through market based instruments and technology development and transfers. However,
combining approaches may induce conflicts not just lead to synergies. A complete assessment of options
for integration would require a complete evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages. Such an
assessment would be part of any future paper beyond this scoping effort.
One area deserving particular attention in analysing the integration of different approaches comparable
may be that of timing. Some approaches, such as the Kyoto targets, have a clear short term focus. They
may still have a long term impact, although less easy to evaluate, in particular as it strongly depends on
what follows the first commitment period. Other approaches may have a longer term focus. This time
dimension may be important, as for example efforts deemed comparable if expressed, say, in monetary
terms, may not do much to alleviate competitive or fairness concerns.
3. Comparing Different Approaches
The successful integration of different approaches may result from rounds of negotiations and trade-offs,
and never require nor rely on a transparent assessment and comparison of Parties respective contributions.
Such a process is not suited for analysis, as it requires an understanding of negotiating positions and
Parties preferences, all difficult to observe and likely to change over time, including during the negotiation
process itself. The interaction with domestic policy-making is another complication for such analysis.
As an alternative, we seek to identify objective means of comparisons of countries efforts, putting them in
perspective to each other. This section offers a first examination of issues in comparing approaches
directly.
Comparisons can be made either on the efforts (to be) accomplished, or on the results (to be) achieved. The
first option would need methodologies to translate efforts-oriented approaches5 into result-oriented
approaches, using comparable metrics. In both cases it would be to account for efforts and results relating
to one countrys own emissions and those relating to assistance provided to other countries emissions
reductions  especially, but not exclusively, to developing countries.
Comparing domestic efforts
A possible comparison metric is costs. Costs might be evaluated ex ante or ex post, or both. Comparisons
should involve costs for the governments and costs for emission sources, i.e. administrative and mitigation
costs. Some approaches may be more able to reveal costs than others, however.
Or input-based approaches, as opposed to output-based approaches, to adopt the terminology of Heller and
Shukla, 2003.
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
For example, carbon taxes would provide ex ante a straightforward indication of marginal costs, but
evaluating total costs will require evaluating ex ante or ex post the amount of abatement achieved, not to
mention possible interaction with the existing or evolving fiscal basis in each country. If this can be done, a
good approximation can be given of total costs from marginal costs and volume, although the cost schedule
can entail different total costs.
A broad emissions trading system would also reveal much ex post information on actual unit costs for
mitigation. Changes in entities or countries registry accounts, indicating net trades, would be useful
indicators of countries costs incurred  or benefits received  internationally through trading mechanisms.
In the absence of underlying price information, a strategic information for private stakeholders, average
prices over the period could be acceptable substitutes. Comparison of baseline trends and targets would
provide useful information. Emissions trading system with price cap would ease ex ante assessment of total
costs, although presumably the multiplication of the estimated emission reductions and the price cap level
provides only an upper estimate.
However, even a single price resulting from linking several emissions trading systems may hide large
differences in costs resulting from differing features in the systems involved, such as rules for closure or
treatment of new entrants. Moreover, emissions trading schemes are likely to interfere with many other
policies and measures. While some would simply aim at making markets more efficient, others would be
inspired by the willingness to develop some specific technology responses, as illustrates the EU renewable
directive, which coexists with the EU emissions trading system. Countries policy mixes already
integrate different approaches, which may or may not facilitate the integration of approaches at the
international level.
As a matter of fact, costs associated with technology approaches may be even more difficult to assess, at
least ex ante. Spending from public and private partnership on R&D can usually be estimated with some
precision. Costs associated with standards are more difficult to assess ex ante, and ex post information may
be difficult to gather. The history of environmental regulations shows that ex ante cost estimates are often
several times higher than ex post assessments. This was notably the case for the strengthening of the
environmental standards for fuel in both North America and Europe (see, e.g., Harrington et al., 2000).
Estimating costs of environmental programmes has proven difficult. However, past programmes  with
limited sectoral and geographic scope  were relatively simple compared to the multiple measures that
greenhouse gas mitigation programmes may involve. According to the IPCC, effective GHG mitigation
may imply hundreds of end-use technologies (Metz et al., 2001) when energy efficiency is the primary
lever for action.
Further, climate change mitigation will involve actions that have multiple benefits and costs. Saving fuel,
reducing local pollutants, reducing urban congestion, reducing fatalities from traffic, are but a few
examples of actions, where either the climate or the other benefits could be considered ancillary to each
other. This is one well-known difficulty in project-based mechanisms, as additionality is often difficult to
demonstrate when non-climate benefits exceed costs. When non-climate benefits are other externalities, it
is even more difficult to decide if these benefits must be taken into account in the analysis  this would be
equivalent to bet whether and when policies able to internalise these costs would be implemented..
Another difficulty is that public-private partnerships may tend to give national companies some
competitive advantage over others. Therefore, other countries may be reluctant to take associated costs into
consideration. Although not a methodological issue, this may have negotiating implications.
Technological approaches based on standards and norms are likely to be more costly than cap-and-trade
approaches. For example, Edmonds and Wise (1999) stated that their technology approach would cost
about 30% more than a cap-and- trade approach to achieve a similar environmental outcome. Comparing
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
efforts may thus over estimate the significance of efforts where governments take less effective policies
than others. However, these expenditures may also provide more emission reductions in the long run.
Indeed, one possible difference between efforts-oriented and result-oriented approaches is that they may
lead to different emission reduction profiles over time. All these issues move the focus from assessing the
efforts to assessing the results, and will be examined below.
If comparisons are to extend to domestic efforts by developing countries, an array of new issues will
appear. Should one use exchange rates or purchase power parities as the basis of these cost comparisons?
Should one focus on monetary values themselves, or on the welfare derived from expenditures?
In any case, one might still consider global, direct comparisons between the policies and measures
undertaken in different countries. Thomas Schelling (2002), for example, considers that the Marshall Plan
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) could offer a model for what might succeed the
Kyoto Protocol if it fails or evolves into something else, adding that their procedure is one that the main
developed nations might pursue prior to any attempt to include developing nations.
NATOs burden-sharing exercise included targets for national military participation, conscription of
soldiers, investments in equipment, contributions to military infrastructure and real estate, and so on. ()
the process was one of reciprocal scrutiny and cross-examination, with high-level officials spending
months negotiating. As Schelling views it, NATO has been an enormous success; member nations made
large contributions in money, troops, and real estate. They did it all voluntarily; there were no penalties
for shortfalls in performance. And, without explicit trading, they practiced the theory of comparative
advantage (in geographical location, for instance, or demographics, or industrial structure). It was an
example of highly motivated partnership, involving resources on a scale commensurate with what a
greenhouse regime might eventually require.
Schelling thus suggests that not all countries need to do exactly the same things, and that broad and direct
comparisons of levels of efforts implied by various policies and measures remain possible. One question is
the potential complexity and necessary time of such negotiations in the case of climate change, if these
comparisons are to serve some of the purposes assigned to integration in section 2. Climate change, on the
other hand, is a long term issue. Another difference between NATO and possible future climate
negotiations is that NATO involved essentially direct governmental expenses, while climate mitigation
would involve efforts from all  governments, regional or local authorities, companies, individuals.
Comparing efforts in helping others
Costs comparisons may be a better metrics of effort when applied to assisting other countries to address
their emissions. Capacity building costs can be estimated, as travel costs, costs of equipment transfers,
patents offered or waived, workers trained and the like.
It would be useful to distinguish donor technology purchase requirements, often the case in bilateral
agreements, when making comparisons with aid forms such as contributions to the Global Environment
Facility (GEF). In practice however making this distinction in expense comparisons may be difficult, as
these economic returns might be difficult to assess.
For somewhat similar reasons, it may not be easy to take into account facilities given to technology
exporters through development banks or export credit agencies. One may also wonder what types of
projects should be considered as helping others to address their emissions. Should one take into account
the whole cost of a more efficient coal fired power plant, for its emissions per kWh would be lower than
those existing in the host country? Or should the reference be the more recent and efficient similar
investments? Should one take into account the costs of natural gas pipelines, or LNG terminal, for similar
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
reasons? Should nuclear power projects be taken into account? Could projects to halt deforestation be
considered? Very likely the same issues than those currently discussed about project-based mechanisms
will have to be considered here even if the needed precision might be lower in this case than what is
required to support market mechanisms. However, crediting emission reductions need not be an inherent
part of such efforts, which would reduce the monitoring cost of these efforts from what they would be
under a crediting mechanism.
Annex II countries are fulfilling part of their obligations under the UNFCCC in financing climate
programmes of the GEF, which funding evolved from voluntary contributions to more organised
replenishment procedures (Sjberg, 1999). Countries could simply do more by increasing their
contribution to the GEF. This is, for example, Schellings preferred approach, as he explains (Schelling,
2002): Eventually, to bring in the developing nations and achieve emissions reductions most
economically, the proper approach is not a trading system but financial contributions from the rich
countries to an institution that would help finance energy-efficient and decarbonised technologies in the
developing world.
Annex II countries, however, also have bilateral or plurilateral agreements  the most recent being the
G8 Climate Action Plan adopted at Gleneagles and the Asia-Pacific agreement announced in Vientiane,
both in July 2005. If and when these agreements trigger significant financing targeted to climate change
mitigation, whether directly or through technology cooperation, participating countries may want these
efforts to be accounted for in any future comparison.
Those Annex II countries that participate to the Kyoto Protocol may also acquire certified emission
reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism, or Emission Reduction Units under Joint
Implementation, or Removal Units. Under future agreements, this may extend to buying emissions
allowances from developing or transition economies under various forms of emission targets. These
countries may be willing to have these action credited to them in this comparison of efforts to help others.
In this case, however, they should not take also into account these reductions against their own targets, or
this would amount to double-counting.
Comparing domestic results
The other main option to make approaches comparable is to balance their results. For countries under a
quantitative emission target approach, determining emission reductions would be relatively straightforward
in comparing baseline trends and actual emission levels. It is likely to be more difficult with other
approaches based on a variety of policies and measures and technology programmes, although this will
depend on their exact form.
In case of approaches focusing on R&D programmes, estimating resulting emission reductions may prove
rather difficult and controversial. Moreover, the results may be expected on longer timescales than in the
case of quantitative targets  although, for example, fifteen years separate the adoption of the Kyoto targets
from the end of the first commitment period. Some technology programmes, as well as other policies and
measures, still have a longer term horizon. For example, carbon capture and storage is not expected to
provide significant reductions before 30 years, neither is photovoltaic, let alone nuclear fusion.
Strengthening building codes has little short term effects, as the built capital stock rotates slowly, but
important cumulative long term effects.
How important is that difference in the timing of emission abatements? At first glance, it may appear of
relatively second order importance, as climate change is a cumulative issue. With respect to long term
concentration levels, emissions taking place later may even seem to matter more than those taking place
earlier, thanks to the natural decay of carbon or methane in the atmosphere.
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
Climate impacts, however, are a different matter. Reducing carbon dioxide and methane contributions to
climate change at a late stage may have long-lasting impacts on the rate of climate change, if not its
eventual extent. Moreover, reaching earlier some unknown thresholds in concentration levels can trigger
positive feedbacks, such as the thawing of permafrost releasing more methane emissions, or the drying up
of tropical forests weakening the terrestrial carbon sink. In sum, feedbacks and non-linear cause-effects
relationships make the comparison of emissions at different points in time very complex (e.g., see SBSTA,
2002), and possibly controversial.
There is another obvious difficulty in comparing the results of approaches that would lead to emission
reductions at significantly different points in time: such comparison must be done on the basis of estimates
 or be performed only years or decades after the action took place.
For approaches based on norms and standards, comparison with results-oriented approaches may be easier.
As already noted, technology approaches based on standards would be similar to quantitative approaches
based on sector-wide output-based targets. More generally, if results of standard-based approaches could
be assessed in quantitative terms of emissions avoided, all forms of quantitative approaches come close to
them  close enough perhaps to allow tradability and close enough probably to ensure the other possible
benefits expected from integration. In this case, standard-based approaches would share with indexed
targets and important characteristic: actual emissions would remain dependant on economic scenarios.
Moreover, trading regimes based on indexed targets can be linked to trading regimes based on fixed and
binding targets and other target types; therefore, it is conceivable to integrate and perhaps efforts-oriented
approaches based on performance standards to any kind of result-oriented approaches  and even perhaps
to link them to each other in the sense of linking emission trading regimes.
Still, the issues of the timing of emission reductions, and the sheer number of technologies involved may
be obstacles. The only simple standard-based approaches found in the literature are rather comprehensive,
focusing on supply side and, perhaps as a consequence, on long time-scales. For example, Edmonds and
Wise (1999) suggested a protocol requiring all new power plants in industrialised countries to be zero
emitting by 2020, all existing power plants by 2050, and similar plants in developing countries when they
reach the same level of per capita GDP expressed in purchasing power parities. In fact, the ex ante
assessment of the outcome of such approach suffers from the uncertainties inherent to a technologyforcing approach  for technology development always remains unpredictable at least in part (Philibert,
2003).
Other, less ambitious approaches, would need much greater levels of detail to target the hundreds of
technologies at end-use level quoted by the IPCC (Metz et al., 2001), and to achieve significant results.
This may lead to rather complicated negotiating processes.
Would the NATO example be of some help in this case? As Schelling (2002) underscores, One striking
contrast between NATO and the Kyoto Protocol deserves emphasis: the difference between "inputs" and
"outputs," or actions and results. NATO nations argued about what they should do, and commitments were
made to actions. What countries actually did -- raise and train troops; procure equipment, ammunition,
and supplies; and deploy these assets geographically -- could be observed, estimated, and compared. But
results -- such as how much each NATO nation's actions contributed to deterring the Warsaw Pact -- could
not be remotely approximated. But what could not be approximated with respect to NATOs non discrete
objective could possibly be approximated in the case of climate change where emissions can be observed
and reductions estimated. One such example may be found in the Methane-to-Markets Partnership, which
sets a specific target of a 50 million metric ton equivalent of carbon reduction by 2015.
Thus, a negotiating procedure following NATOs example, while focusing initially on comparing efforts,
could still allow some rough comparison of results if efforts are formulated in terms of norms and
standards for some, in quantitative emission terms for others. This would need to estimate the likely results
COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT(2005)10
of each and every action, unlikely to be easy task. Real and comprehensive emissions trading, however,
may be out of reach  although some trading may take place at sectoral level, for sufficiently accountable
activities.
Comparing results in helping others
On a project basis, when one only investor intervenes, estimating the results is not beyond possibilities 
this is what is undertaken in the project-based mechanisms framework. However, estimating more globally
the effects of the efforts of each country in helping another may be hopeless. These effects may be difficult
to distinguish from those due to the domestic efforts of the country receiving help, and from efforts
undertaken by other countries in helping the same country  not to mention the role possibly played by
multilateral institutions to which all Annex II countries contribute.
4. Conclusions
Integrating options for GHG mitigation with fundamentally different structures and designs is very
difficult, although not necessarily impossible. This is especially the case between approaches addressing
emissions in a quantitative and comprehensive manner and those establishing output-based standards for
well-identified sectors on the basis of best available or forthcoming technologies.
With respect to domestic efforts to mitigate climate change, comparisons can be based either on efforts,
e.g. through expense evaluation or detailed policies and measures examination, or on results, e.g. measured
in emissions or emission reductions. With respect to efforts to help other countries mitigating climate
change, comparisons may be far from straightforward. Any comparisons may best be based on efforts,
preferably through common institutions.
Such comparisons of approaches could help countries engage in more action, as the public good theory
predicts, and in alleviating concerns about free-riding. In some cases, such as technology approaches or
other policies based on standards, the structure of such approaches could be similar enough to allow
emissions trading, provided the time frames of the different approaches are comparable. This high level of
integration would enhance cost-effectiveness, which could in turn raise the level of action. In some other
cases, the deployment of similar policies in different countries could help increase cost-effectiveness in
accelerating learning-by-doing processes in the development and deployment of new climate-friendly
technologies.
Technology approaches focusing exclusively on research and development programmes are less easy to
compare to result-oriented approaches. Integrating such fundamentally different approaches would be
difficult. However, as R&D approaches tend to have a longer time horizon than all other approaches, they
could be seen as complementary to these other approaches. The relevant issue may thus be integrating
different approaches in individual countries, as well as integrating different approaches followed by
different countries.
Comparisons of efforts in helping others could also increase technology transfers, and this would likely
enhance all the positive effects of integration of approaches in broadening the scope of international action.
All these comparisons, however, are likely to more complex, time and resource-consuming than
comparison between quantitative emission objectives.

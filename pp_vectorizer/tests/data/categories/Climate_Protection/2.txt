THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction to the project
WWF has commissioned ILEX together with a consortium of consultants1 from
across Europe to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme (ETS). We have focused on Phase I (2005 to 2007) and Phase II
(2008 to 2012) of the scheme.
Purpose and scope of this report
The purpose of this report is to provide an independent analysis of the national
allocation plans (NAPs) in six key Member States: UK, Germany, Italy, Poland,
Spain and the Netherlands. This report focuses on the evaluation of the total
number of allowances (or caps) allocated by different Member States2 by:
developing criteria against which to assess the environmental effectiveness of
the EU ETS;
evaluating the number of allowances allocated in Phase I (both in terms of the
level and the way that that level was calculated);
recommending best practice principles for setting cap levels in Phase II;
identifying particular areas and key improvements to address to make NAPs
more environmentally effective in Phase II;
exploring options for the harmonisation of cap-setting approaches in Phase II;
discussing recommendations for future phases of the scheme (beyond 2012).
These six key countries were chosen since their NAPs include approximately 68%
of the allowances3 allocated under the scheme. As a result, policy decisions in
these countries will have a significant impact on the environmental effectiveness
of the scheme. In addition, the NAPs for these countries reflect a wide range of
approaches to cap setting that has allowed us to compare and contrast a variety of
options.

A separate report The environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency of the
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme: Structural aspects of the allocation
authored by the ko-Institut evaluates the way that these allowances have been
distributed to individual installations.
Allowance is the term used to describe the emissions permits that are traded in the EU
ETS. Each EU allowance (EUA) equates to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2).

Organisations involved
Five consultancies were involved throughout the course of this project: Avanzi
(Italy), EcoSolutions Consulting (ESC) (Poland), ILEX (UK), ILEX Iberia
(Spain), ko-Institut (Germany). Each provided country-specific data, analysis
and wider comment on the approach and findings. ILEX led the analysis and was
ultimately responsible for delivering this report.
The project was funded by WWF-UK, WWF-Germany and WWF-International.
The initiation of the project, preparation of draft versions and review of the final
report included input from WWF offices in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland,
Spain and UK, as well as WWF-International and WWF European Policy Office.
Contact details for these offices are provided on the back cover of this report.
Focus of the study
The study has assessed both the total number of allowances allocated by each
Member State (the cap) and the way that these allowances are distributed to
individual installations (structural issues)2. It is these two areas that determine the
effectiveness of the scheme:
the total number of allowances allocated is a key determinant of the aggregate
level of emissions from all these installations; and
the way that they are allocated can potentially change the way that
installations are operated on a day-to-day basis and affect decisions regarding
installation closure and construction.
This report focuses on the first of these areas.
Criteria for environmentally effective caps
Definition of a cap
In the context of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a cap is defined as the total
number of emission allowances given to installations in each participating country
(i.e. Member State). The sum of all the caps in the EU determines the total level
of emissions under the scheme.
Criteria used for this study
We have developed our criteria by reviewing the requirements of the Directive
and subsequent guidance provided by the Commission. In light of these criteria
and our own experience of the scheme, we consider the following four areas to be
important for defining an environmentally effective cap:
The key driver of environmental effectiveness will be the level of a cap. It
should be set to achieve emissions levels below those that would have
occurred in the absence of the scheme (i.e. beyond business as usual) and be
in line with any national and international (e.g. Kyoto) targets.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
For a cap to be environmentally effective it is also necessary that it is based on
a principle of economic efficiency; i.e. that it takes into account the costs of
abatement (both within and outside the traded sector) in order to meet
emissions targets at least cost.
Fairness should also be considered. If a cap is not perceived as fair, it will
call into question the integrity of the scheme and therefore impact on its
acceptability. A cap level should take into account differences between
countries and sectors.
In order to uphold the integrity of the scheme and gain buy-in from
stakeholders, the cap setting process should be transparent. The assumptions
behind the cap level need to be explained in sufficient detail that the level can
be evaluated. The consultation process should be open to all interested parties
and the cap should be set early to provide early certainty for investors. All
relevant documentation should be made available to the public, preferably by
publishing it on a website.
In Table 1, we present eight detailed criteria, under each of these headings, which
we have used for this study.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Evaluation of Phase I NAPs
By using these criteria we have built an objective basis against which to evaluate
each NAP. The ratings are relative, based on a comparison of each of the six
countries. As is the case with any evaluation of this sort, a degree of judgement
has been applied to produce the summary ratings (shown in Table 2 above) and
we recommend that they are considered alongside the full text of this report to
give a full picture of the status of each NAP and the reasons behind the rating.
In summary, none of the caps in Phase I meet all our criteria for environmental
effectiveness. There are some lessons to learn and other good examples to follow
if Phase II caps are to meet our criteria for cap level, economic efficiency, fairness
and transparency. Some of the good examples from Phase I include:
the consultation process in the Netherlands was inclusive;
the UK reflected the characteristics of different sectors by placing the greatest
abatement burden on the power sector; and
in Spain and Italy, the cap was set below business as usual projections of
emissions.
The key points for each country are summarised in Table 3 below.
Table 3  Key findings from Phase I NAPs
Country
Our view
Germany
The Phase I cap appears lax if it is compared to BAU. In addition, the relative
costs of abatement were not taken into account. The bargaining approach to
cap setting that was used limited the opportunity for stakeholder input. The cap
level was, however, set early compared to other countries and the methodology
is relatively clearly documented.
Italy
The final cap in Italy is relatively stringent compared to BAU. However, it
does not take into account the Kyoto target directly. The costs of abatement
were not incorporated into the cap and the cap is not in line with Italys
commitment under the burden sharing agreement. The cap does take into
account differences between sectors to some extent. The stakeholder
consultation process was weaker than that in other countries.
Netherlands
The cap is broadly in line with projected emissions, rather than going beyond
them. The methodology sets out how Kyoto will be met and takes into account
the relative costs of abatement between sectors. However the commitment
under the burden sharing agreement is not reflected and the details of the cap
calculation methodology are not presented. The Dutch approach to stakeholder
consultation was transparent and the cap level was set relatively early.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Country
Our view
Poland
The Polish cap level seems high compared to some projections of BAU, even
after the Commission adjustment. However, the cap is still below the level
implied by Polands Kyotos commitment. The cap does not take into account
the costs of abatement but does account for the differences between sectors.
The prolonged negotiations in Poland have meant the cap setting process has
not been transparent, although the total number of allowances was set relatively
early.
Spain
The Phase I cap stabilises traded sector emissions at historical levels (the
average of 2000 to 2002). The resulting cap is below projected emissions
(which are expected to rise). However, it is not in line with either the Kyoto
target or the burden sharing agreement. Differences between sectors have been
taken into account. The approach to stakeholder consultation was relatively
transparent and the cap calculation methodology can largely be understood
from the documentation5.
The UK cap is broadly in line with both business as usual and the Kyoto target.
However, it is arguably not stringent when compared to the reduction implied
by the national target. The contribution of other policies and measures included
in the UK Climate Change Programme (which covers installations in the nontraded sector as well) was listed in an appendix to the NAP. The cap set for the
power sector reflects the differences between sectors. The supporting
documentation is relatively transparent and a similar approach to consultation
was used to that in other countries. The cap definition was linked to emission
projections, which meant that it changed when the projections changed. The
UK cap was set late.

Lessons learned and recommendations
The evaluation above shows how different countries set their cap for Phase I in a
range of different ways. The key lessons that we have learned from Phase I are
those set out below.
One of the things that we have seen is how difficult it is to compare different
NAPs when each is presented in a different way, contains different information
and explains each aspect of the cap decision differently. Improved co-ordination
of the way that information is presented is a key consideration for Phase II.
Level of cap
The total number of allowances should be fixed as soon as possible and be left
unchanged, as was the case in Germany.
The cap level should be based on a clear and transparent methodology  we
discuss our preferred approach below.
The approach to installation-level allocations is evaluated in a separate report authored by
the ko-Insitut.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
The relationship between the cap level and the Kyoto (and national) targets
should be explained  for instance, the UK NAP includes a chart which
illustrates trend line emissions based on Kyoto and the national target and
where the cap sits in relation to these.
Economic efficiency
The implied abatement burden on the non-traded sector should be set out
clearly and justified  for instance information published for the Netherlands
allows stakeholders to build up a picture of total national emissions taking into
account all the different sectors.
Fairness
The Commission evaluation of the NAPs should include an assessment of
whether and how the contribution of the non-traded sector has been
incorporated into each Member States cap level.
The Commission approval process should consider the burden that each
Member State has placed on its traded sector in the light of the caps set by
other Member States.
Transparency
The assumptions behind the cap calculation should be presented explicitly.
Where projections are used, they should be agreed at the start of the process,
rather than changed as debate develops.
The cap definition should not be linked to projections, but rather a historic
level that is fixed and will not change over time.
Projections will continue to be used to evaluate the level of need of the
traded sector and so to ensure that the cap level is consistent with the Directive
criteria. In order to ensure that the cap is fixed early, however, it is necessary
to ensure that it is linked either to historic emissions or a fixed absolute
amount, rather than to a projected level.
Consultation should be formalised both to increase the transparency of the
way that governments take into account stakeholder views and to ensure that
all stakeholders are given a comparable opportunity to input at an early stage.
Where possible, the Commission should set guidelines to ensure that each
Member State follows minimum requirements for consultation with interested
parties.
All relevant information should be published on a single website to ensure
equal access to information for all interested parties.
Data should be published to allow stakeholders to understand the derivation of
the final figure.
We suggest that guidance from the Commission to standardise the information
provided in the NAPs could help stakeholders to evaluate the NAPs and compare
the approaches in different countries more easily. Without access to this

information, it is difficult to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of the
scheme.
Principles for Phase II NAPs
Best-practice cap setting approaches for Phase II
The evaluation above has shown how countries used a variety of approaches and
methodologies to set caps in Phase I. The Directive and subsequent guidance
issued by the European Commission allowed each country considerable flexibility
in this regard.
WWF has asked us which cap methodology we would recommend based on the
evaluation of environmental effectiveness and lessons learned from Phase 1. In
our view, the distance to target approach is the most attractive. Under this
approach the cap is set at a level that reflects a predefined emissions target for the
traded sector or progress towards it. This target could be either an international
target (e.g. Kyoto) or a national target or one set on the basis of economic
efficiency considerations.
A distance to target approach facilitates:
like-for-like comparison of caps from one period to another  i.e. it is
transparent;
comparison with international (or national) emissions targets  i.e. it enables
an evaluation of whether the cap level is environmentally effective. Where
these targets have been set in a way that is agreed to be fair, the approach
can also result in cap levels that are fair;
consistency over a number of phases (thus providing a degree of certainty and
so ensuring that appropriate and efficient abatement decisions are made); and
can be calculated from published information  again assisting transparency.
Some key elements of the approach are described below.
Cap definition
One of the most important things is that it must be possible to evaluate the level of
a cap in order to establish whether or not it is environmentally effective. If the
baseline for change is an historic data point (rather than a projection), this can stay
fixed over time, which again assists with transparency.
Consistency with international and national commitments
If the cap is set based on international (or national) commitments, then this
approach can result in an environmentally effective level of cap that is also
perceived to be fair. For instance, Member States have agreed that the burden
sharing agreement distributes abatement in a manner that is fair and so setting a
cap on this basis could also meet the fairness criterion.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Economic efficiency
We think that if an analysis of the marginal costs of abatement6 feeds into the
level at which the target is set, then the resulting cap can also be economically
efficient. However, the only way to ensure that the total number of allowances
allocated at an EU level is economically efficient (at an EU level) is to discard
national caps in favour of a pan-EU cap. We expect that caps will continue to be
set independently by each country in Phase II.
Liquidity
Where a liquid carbon market exists (and so the EU ETS functions perfectly),
emissions abatement will be undertaken wherever it can be achieved at least cost,
regardless of which installations the initial allocation is made to. However, as
soon as there is a lack of liquidity7 and it becomes less likely that the market will
work efficiently, it becomes more important that the initial allocation of
allowances (the caps) are determined on an efficient basis if abatement is to be
achieved at least cost.
Best practice menu for Phase II
We have highlighted throughout our analysis how environmental effectiveness
requires caps that are transparent, economically efficient, fair, and are set at a
level that achieves real emissions reductions. The purpose of this best practice
menu is to summarise the findings that we have drawn from the detailed analysis.
A best practice cap would:
fix the total number of allowances (cap) early, in line with the Directive
timescales as a minimum, in order to provide certainty and assist in the
optimisation of investment decisions;
be based on a clear and transparent methodology, preferably expressed as:
a distance to target (in terms of the change on an historic base year); and
include an analysis of the marginal costs of abatement (for both the traded
and non-traded sectors) to show why it is environmentally efficient;
present the NAP calculation step-by-step:
the national Kyoto commitment (including that under the burden sharing
agreement where applicable);
the expected level of carbon dioxide emissions from the traded sector to
meet this commitment;
The marginal abatement cost is the cost to reduce emissions by one unit. This cost will
vary between countries and organisations depending on the source of emissions, the
technology employed and the fuel used in each.
For instance, due to delays in the issuance of allowances, or because a small number of
participants control a large share of the allowances.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
the expected level of carbon dioxide emissions from the non-traded sector
to meet this commitment;
 the targets and measures in place to meet each of these levels;
 comparison of each of these levels against the Kyoto base year and a
recent historic years emissions;
use projections that are:
independently verified and agreed at the start of the process;
 based on published and clearly identified input assumptions;
 explained clearly;
show the relationship between the cap, the Kyoto target and any national
commitments explicitly; and
be subject to formal consultation and comment:
early enough in the decision making process for views to be taken into
account;
taking into account views of all interested parties (including stakeholders
and the public);
supported by informal discussions with all stakeholders; and
the timetable for consultation should be published and kept up-to-date.
In our view, it is likely that governments would need to use projections to inform
their view of the appropriate reduction on the base year. However, it would be
possible to fix the projections used relatively early on to minimise the uncertainty
that changes to the projections at a later stage could cause. Bottom up data could
be used to verify the projections.
Key areas of focus for Phase II
We have noted above that none of the caps in Phase I meet all our criteria for
environmental effectiveness. We note here three key areas of focus in each
country in order to improve the environmental effectiveness of the caps in Phase

Harmonisation
Our evaluation of the Phase I caps has highlighted how different Member States
set their caps in a wide range of ways. This has made it difficult to be sure that
we are comparing like with like and to understand the detailed assumptions
behind the final caps. There is therefore significant scope for both the cap setting
methodologies and the documentation explaining them to be harmonised in Phase
In order to improve the environmental effectiveness of the scheme, harmonisation
would need to affect each of the areas we have considered above:
the level of each cap;
the way that it is calculated, to take into account:
economic efficiency, i.e. the costs of abatement inside and outside the
scheme;
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
fairness, the way that abatement is distributed between different countries
and installations; and
the way that the cap calculation is explained and presented, to improve
transparency.
In this context, harmonisation means aligning the level of national caps by
ensuring that the ways that they are calculated and presented are similar.
We consider that it would be possible to align the approach used in different
countries more closely in Phase II than was the case in Phase I, and improve each
of these areas.
In terms of ensuring that the cap level is environmentally effective, using a
single set of projections to evaluate the NAPs would help to ensure that each
country cap was being assessed in the same way and would also assist in
ensuring fairness between countries.
Given the time constraints for Phase II, it might at least be possible to ensure
that the level of each cap is compared against the same source of historic data.
This would assist transparency and help to ensure that caps are assessed in a
consistent way, both of which would help to ensure that caps are perceived to
be fair.
Member States could be encouraged to explain the way that they have
incorporated both national and international targets in a similar way, in order
to improve transparency and to assist the comparison of the cap levels across
countries.
From an economic efficiency perspective, it would be best to ensure that all
cap levels are set together, to ensure that the total number of allowances is set
at a level that is efficient on an EU-wide scale.
However, given the time and political constraints that would need to be
overcome to make this feasible for Phase II, it should at least be possible to
ensure that each cap takes into account the marginal costs of abatement
between the traded and non-traded sectors.
Lastly, there is plenty of room for harmonisation in the way that information is
presented and the way the cap levels and their calculation are described and
explained. For instance, the format and structure of each NAP could be made
consistent, all relevant documentation could be published on a single website
and the timetables for the cap setting process could be published and kept up
to date.
Beyond 2012: cap recommendations
Given our analysis of the Phase I NAPs, the key issues that we consider important
for the setting of environmentally effective caps beyond 2012 are set out below.
These are points that could be borne in mind by all decision makers when
determining policies for the period beyond Phase II.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Decisions should be made as early as possible not just on the cap level, but
also on the principles for the long-term operation of the scheme in order to
provide operators with a degree of certainty.
The total number of allowances and role of project credits should be set at as
aggregate a level as possible (i.e. an EU level).
Harmonisation of approach at any level would help keep things simple,
reducing the range of methodologies that interested parties need to understand
and facilitating the like-for-like comparison of each aspect;
Steps should be taken to ensure that a liquid market develops  this objective
could be facilitated through expansion of the scheme.
The length of each Phase should be fixed. Keeping to the same length as
Phase II (5 years) would help ensure consistency.
Projections will inform the debate but a single, published set should be used
by everybody.
Given the uncertainties surrounding projections, targets and commitments
should also be described against a historical base.
Rules and decisions should be explained in as transparent a way as possible.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
WWF has commissioned ILEX together with a consortium of consultants8 to
evaluate the environmental effectiveness of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
(ETS).
Purpose of this report
The purpose of this report is to provide an independent analysis of the national
allocation plans (NAPs) in six key Member States: UK, Germany, Italy, Poland,
Spain and the Netherlands. This report focuses on the evaluation of the total
number of allowances (or caps) allocated by different Member States9.
For this report, we have compared the approaches used for cap setting in each of
the countries in Phase I (2005-7). We have based this assessment on a series of
criteria agreed with WWF and described below.
We have used our analysis to identify areas to address to improve the
environmental effectiveness of the scheme in Phase II (2008-12). We have also
developed a list of the key components necessary to ensure that caps are
environmentally effective (a best practice menu).
Policy background
Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has committed to reducing the basket of six
greenhouse gases10 by 8% compared to base year levels by 2008-1211. Figure 1
shows how recent emissions were just 2.9% below base year emissions showing
that considerable effort still needs to be made to meet this target.

A separate report The environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency of the
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme: Structural aspects of the allocation
authored by the ko-Institut evaluates the way that these allowances have been
distributed to individual installations.
Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
The joint EU commitment under the Kyoto Protocol applies only to the EU Member
States at the time of the adoption of the Protocol. The base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O is
1990; for the fluorinated gases 13 Member States of the EU-15 have chosen to select
1995 as the base year, whereas Finland and France have chosen 1990. As the EC
inventory is the sum of Member States inventories, the EC base year estimates for
fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 13 Member States and 1990
emissions for Finland and France.

Each Member State has assumed a legally binding commitment under the socalled burden sharing agreement. This agreement distributes the reductions
required to meet this EU-wide target across different Member States.
Member States can use a variety of national policies and measures to meet these
targets, to encourage abatement from a range of sources, including in the
domestic, transport, commercial and industrial sectors.
In addition to national policies, the Kyoto Protocol allows Member States to use
flexible mechanisms to achieve abatement. Countries may surrender credits
generated under the flexible mechanisms listed below to comply with their
emissions limit under the Protocol:
international emissions trading (IET): allowing states to trade emissions
credits (also called allowances) in order to ensure that abatement is achieved
at least cost;
joint implementation (JI): projects to reduce emissions (or remove emissions

Introduction to the EU ETS
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) began on 1 January 2005 and is linked
to the first category of flexible mechanisms described in paragraph 1.8 above for
the year 2008 and beyond.
1.10
The Emissions Trading Directive14 established a framework for the rules of the
scheme, which is divided into phases. The first, a pilot phase, will run for three
years (until 2007). Subsequent phases will be five years in length. Phase II is five
years in length and runs from 2008 to 2012. Each Member State is required to
develop a National Allocation Plan (NAP) that determines the total number of
allowances that they will allocate to installations covered by the scheme. The
NAP details the number of allowances allocated to reserve for new entrants and
the number of allowances issued to individual installations in each year of any
phase.
1.11
Operators of installations included in the scheme have an obligation to surrender
sufficient allowances each year to cover the installations annual emissions. They
may either use allowances allocated to them for free in the NAP or buy
allowances from other installations in the scheme. In Phase I, operators may also
use CERs and in Phase II, both CERs and ERUs to comply with their obligations.
1.12
The EU ETS is a mandatory scheme that captures combustion installations and
manufacturing processes, from boilers in universities and hospitals, to power
stations and other key sources of greenhouse gas emissions, e.g. steel plant,
cement production facilities and refineries. As such, it covers some of the major
emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe. It therefore forms a key part of the EU
strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto target.
1.13
Phase I of the scheme covers carbon dioxide emissions specifically. In Phase II,
Member States may decide unilaterally to expand the scheme to cover other
sectors and gases.

APPROACH TO THIS STUDY
Scope of project
The purpose of this report is to provide an independent analysis of the cap levels
and approach to cap setting for six key Member States: UK, Germany, Italy,
Poland, Spain and the Netherlands.
These six countries were chosen since their NAPs include approximately 68%15 of
the allowances allocated under the scheme. As a result, policy decisions in these
countries will have a significant impact on the environmental effectiveness of the
scheme. In addition, the NAPs reflect a wide range of approaches to cap setting
that have allowed us to compare and contrast a variety of options.
Structure of project
The study has assessed both the total number of allowances allocated by each
Member State (the cap) and the way that these allowances are distributed to
individual installations (structural issues)16. It is these two areas that determine
the effectiveness of the scheme:
the total number of allowances allocated is a key determinant of the aggregate
level of emissions from all these installations; and
the way that they are allocated can potentially change the way that
installations are operated on a day-to-day basis and affect decisions regarding
installation closure and construction.

Approach to analysis
In order to review the caps on a like-for-like basis and to ensure that we are
capturing all of the areas relevant to assess the environmental effectiveness of the
scheme, we developed a series of criteria to form a framework for our assessment.
These criteria are designed to reflect the key areas that will impact on the level of
Several further revisions of the NAP have been produced since this project began,
however the total number of allowances (on which we concentrate here) has been fixed
since March 2005. The fourth version was available at the start of the project and
provides more information regarding the allocation of allowances between sectors than
earlier versions. (The first version of the NAP was the most detailed, but we have not
used it here since it was rejected by the Commission.)

emissions under the scheme. We set out both the criteria and our evaluation of
how each Member States NAP meets these in Section 3 below.
Our analysis has been based on the information contained in the NAP documents
themselves and other supporting information. The level of detail provided varies
significantly from country to country, as does the way that information is
presented and the format in which it is reported. Throughout the course of the
project we have attempted to ensure that we are comparing equivalent
information; however in some instances it has not been straightforward to confirm
that this is the case. It is important to bear this in mind when interpreting the
results and conclusions set out below.

CAPS AND REDUCTION POTENTIALS
In this section of the report, we compare and contrast the ways that different
Member States set cap levels for Phase I of the scheme. We explore how these
decisions might impact on the environmental effectiveness of the EU ETS. We
then discuss the way in which caps could be set in Phase II and have analysed
quantitatively the kinds of levels these approaches could imply.
Definition of a cap
In the context of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a cap is defined as the total
number of emission allowances given to installations in each participating country
(i.e. Member State).
In their National Allocation Plan (NAP), each Member State determines the level
of this cap i.e. total number of EU allowances (EUAs) that they will allocate to all
the installations included in the scheme during the period of trading and also set
aside in a reserve for new entrants in that phase. The installations covered by the
scheme will be able to emit up to this level and can trade EUAs between
themselves. They will also be able to buy project credits from CDM and JI (see
paragraph 1.8).
Some Member States separated out the total allocation between the activities or
sectors captured in the scheme, resulting in sector and even sub-sector caps (e.g.
the UK has over 50 sub-sectors). Others (such as Germany and the Netherlands)
have not used sector specific allocations at all18 .
Role of the cap in ensuring the environmental effectiveness of the
EU ETS
At an EU level, the caps, together with the extent to which countries allow project
credits to be used, determine the maximum level of emissions allowed from
installations covered by the scheme in each Phase. The tighter (or lower) the
caps, the fewer allowances that are issued and so the lower emissions under the
scheme will be. Laxer (or higher) caps will mean more allowances are issued and
so emissions under the scheme can be higher.
We consider the level of emissions under the scheme to be the key determinant of
its environmental effectiveness. The total of the caps for all the Member States
determines how much installations will need to reduce and manage their
Germany and the Netherlands have shared out the total number of allowances by
calculating the number that should be given to each installation without grouping these
installations into sectors first.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
emissions. In order to deliver national and Kyoto commitments, governments
must set caps in line with achieving these goals.
The sum of all the national caps determines the total level of emissions from the
EU traded sector as a whole. In order to drive abatement in the traded sector to
assist the EU in reaching its Kyoto target, the total number of allowances
allocated will need to fall over time.
We discuss the key criteria that we use to assess the environmental effectiveness
of each countrys cap and the way that it is set below.
Principles for setting caps in Phases I and II
When calculating the total number of allowances to allocate, a Member State must
ensure that it complies with the criteria in the Emissions Trading Directive and
guidelines set out by the Commission. We present these below.
Directive requirements for the caps
3.10
The Emissions Trading Directive requires that the total number of allowances to
be allocated in each year should be reported in the NAP. The total must be
calculated using the following principles:
consistency with each Member State's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol
(and where applicable the burden sharing agreement), taking into account:
the proportion of future emissions for which the traded sector will be
responsible; and
 national commitments and targets, both in terms of energy policy and
domestic climate change programmes;
allocation in line with need:
Phase I caps should put Member States on a path to at least achieve the
burden sharing agreement and Kyoto Protocol commitments;
consistency with actual and projected progress in national emission as reported
to the Commission;
3.11
consistency with the traded sectors abatement potential; and
ensuring that one undertaking or activity is not unduly favoured over another.
In order to comply with the Directive, Member States must also ensure that the
NAP:
is based on criteria that are transparent and objective;
takes due account of public comments;
is supported by allowing stakeholders to access explanations of the decisions
taken;
allocates at least 95% of allowances for free in Phase I, 90% in Phase II; and
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
takes into account the need to allocate allowances to new entrants.
Commission guidance
3.12
The Commission also elaborated guidance19 for Member States which reinforced
the criteria set out in the Directive (listed above) and also clarified that:
the higher the cap for the traded-sector, the lower emissions from the nontraded sector would need to be to meet any target level;
where other policies and measures mean that emissions levels are expected to
increase in the future, for instance due to the replacement of nuclear power
plant, accommodation of the projected increase in the cap would be
acceptable;
when ensuring a Member State was on course to at least achieve its Kyoto and
national targets, the cap would be expected to be on a trend line (not
necessarily a straight line) to those targets;
a Member State should demonstrate how it has taken into account the Kyoto
target;
the cap calculation should take into account the proportion of emissions
covered under the scheme, based on the most recent data available:
the NAP should explain assumptions regarding the future proportion of
emissions outside the scheme;
 any significant deviations from the current proportion of emissions from
the traded sector should be explained;
the Commission views likely need to be linked to projections of the traded
sector as a whole;
once a Member State has decided the proportion of emissions for which the
traded-sector is responsible, this should be used together with a countrys
commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (and burden sharing agreement where
applicable) to calculate the cap;
the abatement potential of the traded sector should consider:
the difference between the options available to operators in the long and
short term;
 the economic and technical potential to abate; and
that the impact of legislative and policy instruments need only be considered if
the expected impact on emissions is significant.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Criteria to assess the environmental effectiveness of the Phase I
and II caps
3.13
The aim of this part of the report is to assess whether we consider the Phase I
NAPs to be environmentally effective, where they could have been improved and
the principles that should be used in developing Phase II caps to ensure that they
are environmentally effective.
3.14
We set out the criteria that we have used to make these judgements, based in part
on the Directive and Commission principles above and also on our own view of
what constitutes environmental effectiveness. We have grouped these criteria into
the following areas:
level of the cap;
economic efficiency;
fairness; and
transparency.
Level of the cap
3.15
The key driver of environmental effectiveness will be a caps level, including how
it compares to business as usual and any national targets. To assess this, we have
developed two criteria, that a cap should:
be at a level to drive real emissions reductions beyond those that would have
happened anyway; and
be at a level that (together with expectations/targets for the non-traded sector)
will result in stated national and international emissions targets (e.g. the Kyoto
targets for 2008 to 2012) being achieved.
Economic efficiency
3.16
For a cap to be environmentally effective, it is also necessary that it is based on a
principle of economic efficiency; i.e. that it takes into account the costs of
abatement (both within and outside the traded sector) in order to meet emissions
targets at least cost. Our next criterion is therefore that a cap should:
be at a level to achieve the abatement necessary to meet the targets at leastcost. In other words, it should properly reflect the economic abatement
potential of the traded sector (as compared to the non-traded sector).
Fairness
3.17
Fairness should also be considered. If a cap is not perceived as fair, it will call
into question the integrity of the scheme and therefore impact on its acceptability.
To be fair, a cap should distribute the economic burden between installations
covered by the scheme and the non-traded sectors equitably. When considered
together, the EU caps should also distribute allowances across the Member States
in a way that reflects their national and international commitments. If the
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
distribution is not balanced in this way, it could be perceived to impact on the
international competitiveness of one or more Member States.
3.18
For the purposes of this report, in order to be considered fair, as between
countries, sectors and installations, a cap should:
meet our third criteria (for economic efficiency) above;
be at a level that takes into account the differential costs and potential for
abatement in different countries (while taking national targets into account);
be at a level that takes into account the differential costs and potential for
abatement in different sectors (for this report, we concentrate on the power
sector).
Transparency
3.19
In order to uphold the integrity of the scheme and gain buy-in from stakeholders,
the cap setting process should be transparent. The assumptions behind the cap
level need to be explained in sufficient detail that the level can be evaluated. The
way in which economic efficiency and fairness have been considered should be
explained in a sufficient level of detail that stakeholders can understand how the
cap meets the criteria above. It should:
be set through a transparent and clearly documented methodology;
be developed in a way that includes consultation (with stakeholders and the
public). The consultation should:
be open to all interested parties;
 allow time for stakeholders to understand the issues and provide comment;
 be early enough that stakeholders views can feed into the decision making
process;
be fixed as early as possible to provide certainty for stakeholders as they
consider investments that affect emissions in the short, medium and long-term.
3.20
It is therefore the level of allocations and also the way in which they are
calculated, plus the way that the methodology is explained to stakeholders, which
determines the environmental effectiveness of a cap. If stakeholders do not have
confidence in the level of allocations in the long-term then that will undermine the
EU ETS as a whole.

Description of the caps in the Phase I NAPs
In the following pages we present a description of the way that the cap was set in
each of the six countries that we have examined (Table 6). We have considered:
the total number of allowances allocated;
the calculation methodology used to determine the cap;
whether projections have been used and if so:
the basis for the projections (e.g. historic interpolation);
 what assumptions are included in the projections;
 the base years to which these projections are applied;
 how growth factors differentiate between sectors;
 whether there are any correction factors;
transparency in using projections and the way in which caps were developed;
how project credits have been accommodated, both for individual installations
and government;
any special circumstances;
how the cap relates to the non-traded sector; and
political considerations in the history of the process of developing the cap and
NAP submissions.

In total, the NAP allocates 499MtCO2 per year for Phase I. This
amount is allocated equally for each year of the phase.
The German cap for 2005/2007 was developed in a two-step
approach. The cap is the result of a pure bargaining process among
the ministries and with industry.
1. Based on the most recent emission inventories available in 2003 the
CO2 emissions of EU ETS sectors amounted to 505MtCO2 (on
average between 2000 and 2002, the base period for Germany). As a
result of the bargaining process, the annual average emissions target
for the sectors was defined as503MtCO2.
2. Based on the reduction from 505MtCO2 in the base period to
503MtCO2 for the period 2005 to 2007, a reduction factor of 0.996
was calculated. The collection of bottom up data showed coverage of
501MtCO2 for the EU ETS. The annual cap of 499Mt CO2 resulted
from a multiplication of the bottom up result and the reduction factor.

A total of 717MtCO2 for Phase I was approved by the Commission.
The cap figure is the same for each year.
The final cap was calculated by the Commission and published in
the Commission Decision of 8 March 2005. The subsequent Polish
NAPs attempt to distribute the allocations among sectors and
installations, correcting the initial NAP-1. The original baseline
emissions quota included forecast emissions from all the
installations covered by the system. The resulting approach is
therefore bottom up, incorporating projected emissions.

original basis for calculation resulted in a cap that exceeds projected

expected and outturn generation would have been reflected by
changes to allocations to the power sector. A number of special
reserves for incumbent coking plants, unidentified installations, and
unplanned emission growth in the EU ETS sectors also resulted in
higher emissions levels than the Commission deemed appropriate.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Evaluation of the Phase I NAPs against criteria for environmental
effectiveness
As set out in paragraphs 3.15 to 3.20, we have considered criteria in four key
areas in assessing whether or not each of the six Phase I caps is environmentally
effective. We consider each of these areas below.
It is worth noting that it is difficult to find historic emissions figures that refer to
the EU ETS population specifically; the relevant historic data are not available in
all of the NAPs. For this report, we have used the data in countries National
Inventory reports20 to make sure that we are using a consistent basis; however the
coverage of these data are somewhat different to that of the scheme.
1. Level of the cap: beyond business as usual
In order to meet our first criterion, a cap should be at a level to drive real
emissions reductions beyond those that would have happened anyway (i.e.
business as usual). For this to be true, we would expect the caps to result in
emissions below our projections for emissions in the absence of the scheme21. In
addition, the aggregation of all national caps should show a reduction on historic
emissions (and, in particular, base year emissions) for the EU as a whole. (This
may also be the case for individual member states as discussed in paragraph 4.10
below.)
One of the key questions is the appropriate level for business as usual. A wide
range of uncertainties exists in projecting emissions in Phase I  from fuel prices
to carbon prices, economic growth to weather  all have an impact on expected
emissions. Each national government, not to mention stakeholder, will have a
different view of the likely level of emissions in Phase I and these views will
change over time as new information comes to light. The potential for differences
in opinion was highlighted during the development of NAPs for Phase I, as the
UK adjusted emissions projections a number of times. In Germany, on the other
hand, the cap was based on an emissions budget rather than projections. For the
purposes of this report we have used the Electrowatt-Ekono projection of BAU
emissions to ensure that the assumptions behind them are consistent across the six
different countries.

http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/national_inventories_submissi
ons/items/2761.php
We address the question of how to ensure that emissions decrease over time when we
look at the way international and national targets have been incorporated (criterion 2
below).
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
The chart below (Figure 2) compares the allocation of each of the six countries
against historic emissions22 in the traded sector and projected business as usual
emissions23. The figures show the difference between each countrys Phase I cap
and projected Phase I emissions.
It should be noted that when making comparisons of this sort, it is not always
straightforward to compare like with like. For instance, the historic data available
varies from country to country and often covers installations or point sources that
are outside the scope of Phase I of the ETS. For the purposes of illustration here,
we have used historic data provided in National Inventory reports as a published
source of information that is reported on a consistent basis across different
countries. However, as noted in the comments under Figure 2, this might
introduce some inconsistency in emissions coverage. For this evaluation we have
evaluated the criterion on the projections, which are tailored to cover the traded
sector specifically, and therefore minimises this problem.

Phase I cap  caps from Phase I National Allocation Plans.
Figure 2 shows how only one country will allow emissions to increase compared
to recent (2003) historic emissions during Phase I. They have all applied some
reduction compared to the projection of business as usual emissions, although
some (such as Spain) are more ambitious than others (e.g. Poland).
On the basis of the assumptions presented here then, all these Phase I caps in the
six countries meet the first criterion, in that all are driving emissions reductions
beyond the projections of business as usual used here (see paragraph 4.5). We
have rated the effort implied by the Spanish and Italian caps as good, by the UK
and the Netherlands as average and Germany and Poland as weak for our
summary evaluation set out in Table 13 (on page 37).
2. Level of the cap: in line with Kyoto and national targets
4.10
In order to meet our second criterion, the Phase I caps would need to be at a level
which, when considered alongside expectations and targets for the non-traded
sector, will result in stated national emissions targets and Kyoto targets being
achieved.
4.11
One of the difficulties in evaluating performance against this criterion for Phase 1
of the scheme is that the Kyoto targets:
cover six greenhouse gases (not just carbon dioxide as the EU ETS does);
cover national emissions rather than just those from the traded sector; and
are targets for 2008-12 (the timescale of Phase II rather than Phase I) and
therefore the targets do not directly apply to Phase I.
4.12
Similarly, the time frame for any national targets is often different to Phase I. The
emissions and sectors covered by national targets are also sometimes different to
the Phase I EU ETS coverage.
4.13
We have considered how each NAP explains the cap puts that country on a path
to Kyoto and national targets. Table 7 sets out our findings for each.

Together, the caps for the traded sector,

emissions to the average level of the
historical emissions in 2000-2002 was
enough to put EU ETS sectors to the
path of Kyoto.
There are no national targets for carbon
dioxide emissions in the traded sector
in Spain.
The UK Kyoto target results in
emissions above BAU and therefore, by
setting a cap below BAU, the UK cap is
in line with Kyoto.

on 1990 levels by 2010) was
considered in the Climate Change
Programme Review, which determined
the abatement contribution of the
traded sector.

4.14
In order to provide a rating under this criterion, we have also considered whether
the recent emissions trend appears to be in line with the Kyoto (and national)
target or whether a country will have significant work to do to meet it.
4.15
This chart illustrates whether emissions have fallen over recent years, or whether
they are increasing. It also shows the level of emissions that result if we take the
Kyoto commitment (using the burden sharing agreement for five of the six
countries) and apply this to emissions in the base year. For the UK Figure 3 also
shows emissions using the national target24 calculated in a similar way (national
targets either do not exist or were not considered in the development of the Phase
I NAP in other countries, see Table 7). We have not included the cap level in this
part of the evaluation, since the coverage of the historic data is not the same as the
traded sector.
The UK national target applies to 2010, the mid year of Phase II.

Notes: Data sources are the same as for Figure 2. We have used information from the NAPs

the Kyoto target to base year emissions (1998). UK national target constructed by applying 20%
reduction to 1990 emissions.

We have used the trends in the chart, combined with whether or not the cap
calculation took the targets into account to inform the ratings set out below:
Germany: the incorporated Kyoto target was considered in the cap calculation.
Recent emissions show an upward trend which would need to be corrected to
be in line with Kyoto: average;
Italy: the link to the Kyoto target was not considered in the cap calculation.
Recent emissions show an upward trend which would need to be corrected to

The Netherlands: the link to Kyoto was considered in the cap calculation.
Recent emissions show an upward trend which would need to be corrected to

Poland: the link to Kyoto was considered in the cap calculation. Recent
emissions show an downward trend which is well below the Kyoto target:
good;
Spain: the Kyoto target was not an explicit assumption in the cap calculation
(which stabilises emissions at historic levels). In light of projections of
emissions for the traded sector, the Phase I cap would need to be more
stringent to put the traded sector on a path to Kyoto: weak; and
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
United Kingdom: the Kyoto target was considered in the cap calculation, as
was the national target. Recent emissions will need to be reduced to be in line
with the national target during Phase II: average.
3. Economic efficiency: achieve abatement at least cost
4.17
Our third criterion requires that a cap ensures that the abatement required to meet
the international and national goals above is balanced between the traded and nontraded sector appropriately. If too great a burden is placed on the traded sector, it
will cost more to achieve the same level of emissions reductions than would have
been the case had the non-traded sector played a greater role.
4.18
For the purpose of evaluating the Phase I NAP, we have based our analysis on the
information provided in the NAP documents themselves. The NAPs do not
provide consistent information about the assumptions that made to assess the
abatement costs in different sectors. For the purposes of the evaluation here then,
we have been able to consider how the contribution of the non-traded sector is
described rather than the validity of the assumptions. For this analysis, if a NAP
has set out and explained how the differential costs of abatement are taken into
account, it does at least go some way to ensuring that the burden is spread
appropriately between sectors.
4.19
Table 8 sets out the approach used in each country. We consider that although a
majority of the countries mentioned the contribution of the non-traded sector, the
assumptions made regarding it are not always very clear (hence the average
rating). Therefore to achieve a good rating here, the Member State must have
quantified the expected effort of the non-traded sector.
4.20
We consider that, although all six countries met the relevant criteria in the
Directive (see paragraph 3.10), only the Netherlands, really sets out and quantifies
the expected contribution from the non-traded sectors in a way that allowed their
contribution to be compared to the traded sector.

Poland
Instead of abatement potential of the non traded sectors, NAP-1
forecasted limited emissions growth from these sectors, based on the
assumption of the growing energy intensity of production in sectors
outside trading system and in services (due to expected increases in
electricity consumption). Transport was singled out as a sector with
expected significant emissions growth.

Emissions from the non-traded sector were considered in calculating
the path for Spain to reach its Kyoto target. How that information is

Notes: Good  targets for non-traded sector explained; Average  costs of abatement outside

4.21
One of the concerns that have been raised is that although policies and measures
might be in place to achieve abatement in the non-traded sector, these measures
might not deliver. WWF has expressed particular concern that abatement may be
more difficult to achieve in the non-traded sector than in the traded sector (even if
abatement could be made relatively cheaply there e.g. energy efficiency
measures). We acknowledge that it can be more difficult to change behaviour in,
for instance, the domestic sector than industrial sectors. We consider that this
should be factored into the estimates of the abatement that each measure is
expected to deliver. The information provided in the NAPs is not sufficient for us
to make a judgement on the extent to which different countries have taken this
into account for this evaluation.
4. Fairness: take into account the differences between countries
4.22
Our fourth criterion takes into account the fact that the cost of abatement and the
potential to reduce emissions varies from country to country. This is one of the
reasons that we would not expect the Phase I caps to reflect a uniform level of
emissions reduction in the six countries.
4.23
One of the difficulties in evaluating all of the criteria under the heading of
fairness is that every stakeholders view of what is fair will differ. For the
purposes of evaluating this criterion in this report, we have considered whether the
Installation-level information collected from operators was used to inform decision
makers of the emissions sources covered by the scheme.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
levels of reduction broadly reflect the distribution of abatement required under the
burden sharing agreement (and the Kyoto target for Poland)26.
4.24
We have taken this approach because the Kyoto targets and burden sharing
agreement have, at some level, been agreed to be fair and take into account the
differences between countries. Although they apply to all greenhouse gases rather
than just those sources covered by the EU ETS (see paragraph 4.11) we have used
them to assess at a high level in which countries abatement might go beyond the
requirements under these agreements.
4.25
From Table 9, we can see that even though Spain already has the greatest increase
in allowances under the burden sharing agreement, its allows traded sector
emissions to increase still further.

Notes: Good: cap implies greater reduction that target; Weak: cap implies smaller reduction than
target. Target base year for Poland 1988, 1990 for all other countries. We used information on
historic emissions from the NAPs where it was available. Where it was not (for Italy, Poland and
the UK), we assumed that the traded sector emitted the same proportion of total national emissions
as in the nearest year for which we do have emissions data split between the traded and non-traded
sectors.
It should be noted that Poland is not covered by the EU burden sharing under Kyoto since
it joined the EU in 2004. We understand that this is one of the fundamental reasons for
the prolonged negotiations of the National Allocation Plan.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
5. Fairness: take into account the differences between sectors
4.26
In our analysis we have also considered whether or not the Phase I caps take into
account the differential costs and potential for abatement in different sectors, by
concentrating on the power sector as an example.
4.27
The power sector contributes the majority of emissions in the EU ETS
(approximately 60% of the total emissions captured in Phase I, across all EU
countries).
4.28
For the purposes of this evaluation, in order to assess how closely aligned the
sector cap is to the expected emissions of the installations captured in it, i.e. how
well the NAP has taken into account the characteristics of the sector, we have
compared the sector cap against business as usual projections.
4.29
It should be noted that this is not the same as asking whether the NAPs require the
maximum possible level of abatement from different sectors, rather that they have
at least assessed the contribution that could be expected from the power sector in
particular. It would be possible to construct scenarios for lower (or indeed higher)
levels of emissions from these installations, which would then affect our rating of
the NAPs below. The key question for fairness though is whether or not the
differences in potential for various sectors to abate has been considered and
incorporated. We have looked at questions of whether an appropriate number of
allowances have been issued under the criteria concerning the level of the cap
above.
4.30
This is a more straightforward task in those countries (such as Spain and the UK)
that determine an allocation to this sector. We have not been able to perform this
evaluation for those countries that do not set a cap for a power sector defined in
their NAPs (Germany and the Netherlands).
4.31
Figure 4 shows how the burden placed on the power sector in Phase I varies
significantly from country to country. In the UK and Spain, the power sector has
been allocated allowances below business as usual projections (although, as noted
above, it would be possible to construct scenarios with lower (or higher) levels of
emissions). In other countries, operators have been allocated in line with business
as usual projections (e.g. Italy).
4.32
In our view then, given the focus of this report on the power sector, we consider
that Poland, Spain and the UK have taken into account the abatement potential of
the power sector (and therefore achieve a rating of good against this criterion).
Italy has allocated more closely in line with need and therefore achieves a rating
of average. As explained above, we have not been able to evaluate the
allocation to the Netherlands and Germany.

6. Transparency: clearly documented methodology
4.33
In order to assess whether a cap meets any or all of the criteria established above,
sufficient information should be available on which to be able to make such a
judgement.
4.34
For each Member State, the most important source of information about their cap
is their National Allocation Plan, list of installations and any supporting
documentation. The format and detail of these documents is guided by the
Directive. Each of the countries that we have looked at has chosen to report
different information and to present it in a variety of ways. This makes it difficult
to get to the bottom of the details of how the caps were calculated and also to be
certain that we are comparing like with like.
4.35
In our view, the actual cap calculation is not fully transparent in any of the
countries. Table 10 summarises the information provided in each NAP and how
comprehensively the cap setting process is explained.

The main principle of calculating the national cap as indicated by the
Commission is clear but as the subsequent NAP versions changed,
the level of allocations assigned to the reserve, and the principles of
calculating emissions for the individual installation groups are not
sufficiently explained.
Weak
Spain
Spain decided to allocate 157.86MtCO2/a to existing installations,
which is the average emission in 2000-2002. Its not transparent
how they decided that this was a sufficient allocation to be on the
path to Kyoto.
Average
It is hard to equate the final cap to the original stated methodology.
There are a large number of sub-sectors and it is not straightforward
to determine how the allocations to each of these have been
calculated. The UK did provide relatively detailed information on
its emissions projections compared to other Member States.
However, given the revisions to them and the subsequent rejection
of the associated cap amendment by the Commission, it could be
argued that the process lacked transparency.

Average  the high-level principles can be discerned from the NAP, but it is difficult to understand
the details; Weak  it is difficult to understand even the high-level principles on which the cap
calculation is based.
7. Transparency: include consultation with all interested parties
4.36
We have also considered how consultation was used in Phase I. One of the
requirements of the Directive is that public comment be considered in finalising a
countrys NAP (although not its cap explicitly). However, there is a difference
between opening up the issues to public comment once decisions have effectively
been finalised and taking on board the views of both EU ETS operators and other
interested parties as an integral part of the decision-making process.
4.37
In order to meet this criterion, the consultation should:
be open to all interested parties;
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
allow time for stakeholders to understand the issues and provide comment;
be early enough that stakeholders views can feed into the decision making
process.
4.38
In addition, all documents should be published on a website and so be equally
accessible to all interested parties.
4.39
Table 11 explains the approach to consultation used in each country. It is a
difficult area to evaluate since, as is the case with fairness, every stakeholder is
likely to have a different view of how the consultation process worked from their
perspective, influenced to some extent by how closely the eventual outcome of the
process matches their view.
4.40
We have therefore taken a simple approach. Where government opened the
decisions up for more than one round of formal consultation and published
documents on the internet (possibly on more than one website), we consider this
to be average.
4.41
Where either the opportunity for formal comment was less than this, or industry
meetings were focussed on a small number of stakeholders, or information was
not published, we consider the approach to be weak for the purposes of this
evaluation.
4.42
Where all stakeholders were given both formal and informal opportunities to
comment, the documents were published on a single website and, in our view, the
process by which stakeholders could comment was made public, we have rated
the approach as good.

Notes: Good: all stakeholders were provided with opportunity to comment on the cap decision

4.43
One of the key concerns of the Phase I process was the extent to which
stakeholders were able to influence the allocation process outside the formal
consultation route. It is difficult to tell how much an impact industry lobbying
had on the cap levels, either through adjustment to the inputs to projections or
changing the abatement burden placed on the traded sector. Given that, by
definition, limited comparable information is available on this impact, we have
not attempted to evaluate it here.
8. Transparency: be set early
4.44
Our final criterion is that the total number of allowances should be set as soon as
possible. This is in order to allow operators of installations in the scheme to make
the necessary operational and investment decisions for the scheme to impact on
their emissions. In addition, indications of the likely cap level in future phases of
the Scheme allow operators to plan ahead and form a view of the future cap level.

4.45
The Directive required that the Phase I NAPs, including the cap level, be finalised
by March 2004; however, as set out in Table 12 below, very few Member States
achieved that deadline.
4.46
In order to evaluate each country against this criterion, we have taken into account
the date on which the total number of allowances was approved by the
Commission and accepted by the Member State. (Although it has taken some
countries much longer to decide how to distribute this cap amongst installations,
this aspect of transparency will be considered in the accompanying structural
report).
4.47
We have also noted whether or not the NAP indicates the likely level of effort
required from the scheme in future Phases. Yes means either that a government
explicitly showed how the burden would fall on the traded sector (e.g. Italy) or
that it provided some quantified indication of the measures it will take to meet the
Kyoto target in Phase II (e.g. Spain). No means that there is no indication of the
level of ambition (i.e. share of the abatement burden) for the traded sector in
Phase II and beyond.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Table 14  Key issues arising from our analysis of the caps
Country
Our view
Germany
The Phase I cap appears lax if it is compared to BAU. In addition, the relative
costs of abatement were not taken into account. The bargaining approach to
cap setting that was used limited the opportunity for stakeholder input. The
cap level was, however, set early compared to other countries and the
methodology is relatively clearly documented.
Italy
The final cap in Italy is relatively stringent compared to BAU. However, it
does not take into account the Kyoto target directly. The costs of abatement
were not incorporated into the cap and the cap is not in line with Italys
commitment under the burden sharing agreement. The cap does take into
account differences between sectors to some extent. The stakeholder
consultation process was weaker than that in other countries.
Netherlands
The cap is broadly in line with projected emissions, rather than going beyond
them. The methodology sets out how Kyoto will be met and takes into
account the relative costs of abatement between sectors. However the
commitment under the burden sharing agreement is not reflected and the
details of the cap calculation methodology are not presented. The Dutch
approach to stakeholder consultation was transparent and the cap level was set
relatively early.
Poland
The Polish cap level seems high compared to some projections of BAU, even
after the Commission adjustment. However, the cap is still below the level
implied by Polands Kyotos commitment. The cap does not take into account
the costs of abatement but does account for the differences between sectors.
The prolonged negotiations in Poland have meant the cap setting process has
not been transparent, although the total number of allowances was set
relatively early.
Spain
The Phase I cap stabilises traded sector emissions at historical levels (the
average of 2000 to 2002). The resulting cap is below projected emission
(which are expected to rise), however it is not in line with either the Kyoto
target or the burden sharing agreement. Differences between sectors have
been taken into account. The approach to stakeholder consultation was
relatively transparent and the cap calculation methodology can largely be
understood from the documentation28.
The UK cap is broadly in line with both business as usual and the Kyoto
target. However, it is arguably not stringent when compared to the reduction
implied by the national target. The contribution of other policies and
measures included in the UK Climate Change Programme (which covers
installations in the non-traded sector as well) was listed in an appendix to the
NAP. The cap set for the power sector reflects the differences between
sectors. The supporting documentation is relatively transparent and a similar
approach to consultation was used to that in other countries. The cap
definition was linked to emission projections, which meant that it changed
when the projections changed. The UK cap was set late.

4.50
In summary, while none of the cap methodologies meet all our criteria. There are
however some good examples from Phase I. For instance:
the consultation process in the Netherlands was inclusive;
the UK reflected the characteristics of different sectors by placing the greatest
abatement burden on the power sector; and
in Spain and Italy, the cap was set below business as usual projections of
emissions.
However, the environmental effectiveness of each cap could be improved by
addressing the aspects of the criteria that we have evaluated here (as illustrated in
Table 13). We have set out the key lessons learned and recommendations below.
We have also identified and summarised areas for improvement in each of the
countries in Section 7 (page 57).
Lessons learned and recommendations
4.51
The evaluation above shows how different countries set their cap for Phase I in a
range of different ways. The key lessons that we have learned from Phase I are
those set out below.
4.52
One of the things that we have seen is how difficult it is to compare different
NAPs when each is presented in a different way, contains different information
and explains each aspect of the cap decision differently. Improved co-ordination
of the way that information is presented is a key consideration for Phase II
(something that we explore in more detail in the section on harmonisation below).
Level of cap
The total number of allowances should be fixed as soon as possible and be left
unchanged, as was the case in Germany.
The cap level should be based on a clear and transparent methodology  we
discuss our preferred approach below.
The relationship between the cap level and the Kyoto (and national) targets
should be explained  for instance, the UK NAP includes a chart which
illustrates trend line emissions based on Kyoto and the national target and
where the cap sits in relation to these.
Economic efficiency
The implied abatement burden on the non-traded sector should be set out
clearly and justified  for instance information published for the Netherlands
allows stakeholders to build up a picture of total national emissions taking into
account all the different sectors.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Fairness
The Commission evaluation of the NAPs should include an assessment of
whether and how the contribution of the non-traded sector has been
incorporated into each Member States cap level.
The Commission approval process should consider the burden that each
Member State has placed on its traded sector in the light of the caps set by
other Member States.
Transparency
The assumptions behind the cap calculation should be presented explicitly.
4.53
Where projections are used, they should be agreed at the start of the process,
rather than changed as debate develops.
The cap definition should not be linked to projections, but rather a historic
level that is fixed and will not change over time.
Projections will continue to be used to evaluate the level of need of the
traded sector and so to ensure that the cap level is consistent with the Directive
criteria. In order to ensure that the cap is fixed early, however, it is necessary
to ensure that it is linked either to historic emissions or a fixed absolute
amount, rather than to a projected level.
Consultation should be formalised both to increase the transparency of the
way that governments take into account stakeholder views and to ensure that
all stakeholders are given a comparable opportunity to input at an early stage.
Where possible, the Commission should set guidelines to ensure that each
Member State follows minimum requirements for consultation with interested
parties.
All relevant information should be published on a single website to ensure
equal access to information for all interested parties.
Data should be published to allow stakeholders to understand the derivation of
the final figure.
We suggest that guidance from the Commission to standardise the information
provided in the NAPs could help stakeholders to evaluate the NAPs and compare
the approaches in different countries more easily. Without access to this
information, it is difficult to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of the
scheme.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
PRINCIPLES FOR PHASE II CAPS
Challenges for decision makers in Phase II
Demands on the Phase II caps
Phase II of the Scheme is considerably different to the pilot Phase:
the scheme runs for five years rather than three  the rules will apply (to more
installations if the scope of the scheme is expanded at all) for longer;
Member States can decide to unilaterally extend the Scheme to more sectors
and gases;
operators have had earlier warning of this Phase and its possible impacts;
governments and stakeholders have experience of developing (and to a limited
extent operating under) the Phase I rules;
the Phase I process has set a precedent in many ways  industry is now aware
of the effect that their lobbying can have;
many Member States have collected data and so have a better understanding of
the installations covered by the scheme; and
the Kyoto targets are binding  national governments will need to ensure that
total national emissions do not exceed the number of assigned amount units
(AAUs) allocated to them, so there will be strong incentives to ensure that
both traded and non-traded sectors are brought in line with the target.
These factors point towards stronger NAPs for Phase II.
However one key constraint remains: time. Once again, for Phase II, governments
are making decisions on the cap level and allocation methodology simultaneously.
It would be unreasonable to expect that political considerations will not continue
to affect the way that different countries implement the Directive. Especially
where significant abatement is required in Phase II, governments and decision
makers will come under even greater lobbying pressure than for Phase I.
Considerations in setting a cap in Phase II
Each government will take into account the issues set out below when deriving its
Phase II caps.
Who bears the cost
The EU ETS captures only a subset of the installations and gases on which Kyoto
targets (and national targets) are based. As a result, governments must share the
burden of reaching the target between the traded sector (those installations
captured under the scheme) and the non-traded sector.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Economic efficiency
In theory, the appropriate balance would be to set the EU ETS cap at the point
where the marginal cost of abatement in both of these groups of installations (in
the traded and non-traded sectors) is equalised (shown on the left of Figure 5).

In practice, Member States need to take into account a range of issues at the
national level as the NAPs are developed. One of these is how the costs of
abatement in the traded sector relate to those in the non-traded sector at a national
level (the right-hand diagram in Figure 5). Some other issues are highlighted
below.
International competitiveness
First of all, each Member State is developing its own National Allocation Pan,
independent of the other countries meeting the EU wide target. The burden
sharing agreement means that much of the bargaining over the balance of effort
has already taken place. However, each countrys national government has an
incentive to do as well out of the scheme as it can by minimising the abatement
burden that it places on its industry and allocating proportionately at least as many
allowances to national companies as do the governments in competitor countries.
5.10
Competitiveness concerns, such as the impact on the costs of particular industries
and on international investment, are at the forefront of decision-makers minds.
Efforts to incorporate industry views have also prompted observers to ask how
much of the cap is set by analysis of the fundamentals and how much through
lobbying power.
International emissions targets
5.11
Since the first Kyoto target commitment period is also not until the second Phase
of the scheme, it is difficult to show whether caps set for the first Phase really put
the traded sector on track to meet Kyoto. Caps for Phase II will need to be in line
with the Kyoto target given that the timeframes are the same. Even in the second
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
phase, whether the cap is as effective as it could have been will depend on other
policy measures adopted to constrain emissions.
National goals
5.12
Member states that have set national targets for emissions will also consider these
when setting caps for Phase II. For instance, the UK has set a domestic target for
a 20% reduction on 1990 emissions by 2010. Decision makers will consider how
much of the burden to meet this target should be placed on the traded sector and
so incorporated into the cap calculations.
Availability of data
5.13
When considering the abatement potential of the installations in the scheme,
abatement cost calculations are subject to a wide range of uncertainties and
comprehensive data are difficult to find. Estimates of projected and expected
emissions during the phase are therefore inherently uncertain.
Political constraints
5.14
Governments also face political considerations when deciding how to implement
the EU ETS. In order for the introduction of such a scheme to be accepted by
industry, the burden placed on them must be perceived to be fair. Each
stakeholders perception of fairness will be different, depending on their
environmental goals, the investments they may have made already and the
structure of their industry. The short-term costs that will be incurred by
individuals and Member States can obscure the longer-term value of
environmental benefits.
Differential treatment of industries
5.15
There is therefore pressure for the cap level to take into account the particular
circumstances of different operators and industries. Even within the constraints of
the Directive, it is possible for governments to differentiate treatment in this way.
The differential treatment of industries has caused the process for cap making in
Phase I to become more and more complicated, often less transparent more and
difficult to understand from the outside.
Timing
5.16
The Directive requirement that the EU ETS is divided into phases, together with
its short time frame overall (only eight years), restricts the certainty that the
current structure provides. The Commission approval process aims to ensure that
all the countries involved stick to the rules. However, the timing of their
decisions and the high level at which adjustments have been made at these times
have resulted in prolonged uncertainty for many operators.
Beyond 2012
5.17
The rules and framework for the scheme are not yet in place beyond Phase II. As
a result, decision makers will be balancing the need to take action to reduce
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
emissions today against uncertainties surrounding climate change policy in the
future. Governments will also consider the extent to which Phase II might be
considered to set a precedent for future phases. We discuss these issues further in
Section 7 below.
Managing uncertainties
5.18
The Phase II NAPs will be finalised in 2006 and will determine allocations out to
2012. A wide range of factors could influence emissions levels within these
timescales. Amongst other things, emissions in Phase II will depend on the rate of
economic growth, the development of clean technologies and trends in energy use.
Governments will take all these factors into account, when setting a cap.
5.19
In addition, since all Member States are setting their caps at the same time as each
other, government will also need to manage uncertainties about the abatement
burden other countries will place on their traded sector. Although decision
makers will have an idea of the kinds of levels that caps might be set at elsewhere,
there is no certainty until the other NAPs have been approved by the Commission.
Use of project mechanisms
5.20
The mechanisms to generate and accommodate credits generated through project
mechanisms (Joint Implementation and also the Clean Development Mechanism)
should be further developed by the start of Phase II. The Kyoto Protocol requires
that the purchase of credits be supplemental to domestic action, however there are
no hard and fast definitions for what supplemental might mean. As a result
Governments will need to consider the extent to which they will allow operators
to use certified emissions reductions (CERs) and emissions reduction units
(ERUs) in the EU ETS and how they will be used at a national level to comply
with the Kyoto targets.
Approaches available
5.21
We describe in Table 15 the range of approaches that are available to decision
makers for setting caps, and then recommend a preferred methodology in terms of
environmental effectiveness below (see paragraph 5.34).
5.22
The final methodology that a country uses will depend on how strongly it weights
each consideration against the others. For instance, in some countries
competitiveness issues might be considered more important than ensuring
economic efficiency.
5.23
It is worth noting that in principle any of these approaches could result in the same
level of cap (which is what we consider really drives the effectiveness of the
scheme). However, since each method places different weight on the issues
discussed above, it is unlikely that they will. Whether one will result in a higher
or lower cap depends on the specific circumstances of the country and the
assumptions made in the calculations.

Table 15  Approaches to calculate a Phase II cap
Description of approach
Level:
cap beyond
emissions
Marginal abatement
cost
The cap level is set at
that where the marginal
cost of abatement both
inside and outside the
traded sector is
equalised (see
paragraph 5.7).
Equal cost burden
The resulting cap may
be beyond BAU at the
national level if this is
the way total emissions
are calculated. Even if
total emissions are
beyond BAU though,
the allocation to the
traded sector may be
above or below that
level. It will depend on
whether it is more
expensive to abate
inside or outside the
traded sector.
The resulting cap may
be beyond BAU at the
national level if this is
the way total emissions
are calculated. Even if
total emissions are
beyond BAU though,
the allocation to each
individual sector may
be above or below that
level. It will depend on
whether it is more
expensive to abate in
one particular sector
than another.
The cap level is set to
equalise the expenditure
on abatement required
from each sector within
a country or the same
sector in different
countries.
Distance to target
The cap is set at a level
that reflects a
predefined emissions
target for the traded
sector or progress
towards it. This target
could be either an
international target (e.g.
Kyoto) or a national
target.
If the target requires
emissions lower than
BAU, this criterion
would be met.
Proportional
contribution
Emissions (and so the
cap) in the traded sector
are set as a proportion
of total emissions (for
this analysis, we
assume this total is
determined through a
distance to target
approach).
If the proportion of
emissions assigned to
the traded sector is
based on history, then
given this is likely to
change in the future, the
resulting cap could be
higher or lower than
BAU. If the target used
to calculate total
emissions is lower than
BAU, this criterion
would be met.
Bargaining
The cap level is defined
through discussion,
between e.g. different
government
departments, other
regulatory bodies and
stakeholders.
Whether the approach
meets this criterion will
depend on the relative
bargaining position of
each participant and the
compromises reached.
It is possible (although
unlikely) that no
consideration will be
given to expected
emissions in Phase II.
The starting point could
instead be either the
Phase I cap or a historic
emissions level, for
instance.

Distance to target
Yes, this approach
should result in a cap
that is in line with
targets.
Proportional
contribution
It could be argued that
the cap and target are
more likely to be
aligned if the traded
sectors share is taken
as its share in the base
year for the target. This
will depend completely
though on how the
balance between
emissions in the traded
and non-traded sectors
has varied over time in
the particular country.
Bargaining
Again, a cap might
meet this criterion,
particularly if a preexisting agreement such
as a target is more
acceptable to the
participants than some
other level. However,
unless the target is
considered explicitly, or
aligns closely with one
of the parties
bargaining positions, it
is unlikely this criterion
will be met.

Yes, this approach
should result in a cap
that is economically
efficient.
Equal cost burden
It will depend how the
total number of
allowances to allocate
is determined. If it is
based on some preagreed emissions level
that takes into account
the differences between
countries, then it could
meet this criterion.
It will depend how the
total number of

whether the

to achieve an equal

across countries or
within a country.
No, not between
sectors, since the
abatement burden is not
distributed on the basis
of economic efficiency.
Instead, the calculation
places the abatement
burden even in those
sectors where
abatement is expensive
to achieve.
Distance to target
It depends on the way
that the target was
established. For
instance,
if the relative costs of
abatement are
considered explicitly,
and the balance
between costs of
abatement inside and
outside the ETS is the
same as the balance of
emissions, then this
criterion could be met.
If the target already
takes into account
difference between
countries (e.g. the
Kyoto target), then this
criterion could be met.
Proportional
contribution
If the balance between
costs of abatement
inside and outside the
ETS is the same as the
balance of emissions,
then this criterion
would be met.
The proportion of total
emissions that the
traded sector
contributes can be
tailored to the specific
country. However,
whether or not this
approach meets this
criterion will depend to
a larger extent on the
way that the total
number of allowances
is determined.
Bargaining
Analysis of the relative
costs of abatement is
data intensive and
requires a range of
assumptions to be
made. It is quite
possible that one or
more parties will base
their starting position
on such an analysis.
However, it is unlikely
that two parties
analyses will result in
the same level of cap
and so therefore that
this approach will result
in a cap that is
consistent with this
criterion.
If the participants
represent interests
beyond the Member
State setting the cap,
then it is more likely
that the resulting cap
will take into account
the relative position of
that particular Member
State.

Yes, although it does

differentiation between

The data intensity of
this approach and the

The calculation to work
out the cost burden to

rather complicated to

based on a large
number of assumptions.
The basis for the
distribution could
probably be simplified
and based on published
data.

It is possible that
targets could be set for
different sectors and
aggregated to a sector
cap. Given the
relatively simplicity of
a distance to target
approach, the cap could
be disaggregated
between sectors
relatively easily.
We consider that the
relative simplicity of
this approach
(particularly if preexisting targets are
used) means that this
should be the easiest
approach to explain
clearly.
Proportional
contribution
This approach could
take into account
differences between
sectors, but only really
in a high-level way (if,
for instance the target
on which it is based is
disaggregated for
different industries).
The high level approach
is relatively
straightforward and
could therefore be
clearly explained to
stakeholders. Since
emissions data are
published, it should also
be possible to make the
basis for the
proportional split
readily available.
Bargaining
Yes, it is likely that this
approach will result in
differential treatment of
sectors. However,
whether the resulting
caps are fair will
depend on the lobbying
power of each of the
sector representatives.
Depending on the
nature of the
compromises reached
and also the basis for
each partys input, this
is likely to be one of the
more difficult
approaches to document

approach is more likely
to be limited under this
approach (for instance,
on the way that the total

how any target is shared

5.24
In order to compare these approaches, we have assumed that for Phase II each
country will determine its cap on its own. We discuss scope for harmonisation of
caps and agreements to co-operate on cap setting in the beyond 2012 section
(section 7) of this document.
5.25
It is worth noting that it is unlikely any country will use a pure form of the
approaches described here. It is more likely that each Member State will start
with one approach but take into account a range of other factors (such as political
concerns and other domestic policies). In addition, whatever the approach a
Member State chooses for its NAP, the Commission approval process introduces
some degree of bargaining.
5.26
We summarise some of the detailed evaluation from the table in the text below.
Marginal abatement cost
5.27
The main advantage of the marginal abatement cost approach is that it ensures that
the total number of allowances allocated under the scheme is as consistent with
the costs of achieving abatement inside the sector as outside it (i.e. it is
economically efficient). This is consistent with the efficiency principles behind
the emissions trading scheme. The main downside is that it is data intensive and
subject to a range of assumptions. This makes it more difficult to explain and so
possibly less transparent than some other approaches. The results can apparently
conflict with the fairness criteria, since more abatement will be targeted at those
sectors that can abate more cheaply.
Equal cost burden
5.28
The main advantage of the equal cost burden approach is that some operators will
perceive it to be fair since the same level of expenditure would be assumed for
all sectors within a country. On the other hand, those sectors that had already
invested in abatement or those might equally consider the approach unfair. One
of the main difficulties of the approach would be deciding the appropriate level of
cost to share amongst installations and then the level of abatement that each might
be expected to achieve for that sum of money. This makes it a relatively
complicated approach to explain and so it would lack in transparency. In addition,
the approach does not meet the efficiency criterion since the relative costs of
abatement are not equalised.
Distance to target
5.29
The main advantage of this approach is that it can be expressed in simple terms,
particularly if linked to historic emissions (for instance a 5% cut on 2004
emissions). It is therefore transparent. It can also be changed over time to reflect
a tighter cap by changing the percentage reduction. The first consideration is the
best way to determine the appropriate level of target, then how to justify and
explain it. Whether or not the level of the cap that results is environmentally
effective will depend on the target chosen (e.g. whether it is an international or
national commitment). If the marginal costs of abatement are taken into account
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
explicitly in the derivation of the target then it could meet the economic efficiency
criterion. It will meet the fairness criterion if the relative burden placed on
different groups of installations is considered in setting the target.
Proportional contribution
5.30
The simplicity of this approach is its key advantage. The fact that it can also be
linked to a target (and so be made consistent with (inter)national commitments) is
another point that would aid transparency. If the approach is to be considered fair,
however, it would be necessary to explain why the proportion of the total
emissions was appropriate, and also how and why the target was derived (see
paragraph 5.29). In addition, to be economically efficient, the proportion would
need to take into account the relative costs of abatement.
Bargaining approach
5.31
The main attraction of this approach is that it can leave all stakeholders involved
in the bargaining process with a perception that the resulting number is fair. For
this to be the case, however, the process by which agreement is reached would
need to be transparently presented and the interests of all relevant stakeholders
considered. In addition, it is possible that all parties will walk away feeling the
result in unfair. It is very unlikely that the outcome will be either transparent or
economically efficient. It is also quite possible that the final level will not be
environmentally effective, although this will depend on the positions and relative
strength of the different bargainers.
Top down versus bottom up
5.32
One question remains, whichever of the approaches set out above is used: whether
to build up the cap level from installation-level data (bottom up) or to set it at a
high level first and share it out later (top down). Phase I showed that either
approach was considered to meet the Directive criteria, since NAPs using both
approaches were approved.
5.33
The main advantage of the top down approach is that it allows the total number of
allowances to be fixed based on the kinds of approaches we have described. One
of the disadvantages is that, if it is based on projections, it is possible that the total
number of allowances can change every time the projections are adjusted. One
advantage of a bottom up approach is that it enables the total number of
allowances to be tailored to the installations covered by the EU ETS. It can be
more data-intensive though and, once the information is aggregated, can also
result in a total number of allowances that does not appear to directly relate to the
high level principles for the cap.
Preferred approach to set Phase II caps
5.34
Table 15 shows that although each approach can meet all of our criteria, whether
it does so will depend to a great extent on the detailed information used and the
way that the process is conducted.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
5.35
WWF has asked us which cap methodology we would recommend based on the
evaluation of environmental effectiveness above and lessons learned from Phase
1. In our view, the distance to target approach is the most attractive in that it
facilitates:
like-for-like comparison of caps from one period to another  i.e. it is
transparent;
comparison with international emissions targets  i.e. it enables an evaluation
of whether the cap level is environmentally effective;
consistency over a number of phases (thus providing stakeholders with a
degree of certainty and so ensuring that appropriate and efficient abatement
decisions are made); and
can be calculated from published information  again assisting transparency.
5.36
If the baseline for change is an historic data point (rather than a projection), this
can stay fixed over time, which again assists with transparency. As we have
highlighted in the lessons learned section of the report, one of the most important
things is that it must be possible to evaluate the level of a cap in order to establish
whether or not it is environmentally effective.
5.37
If the cap is set based on international commitments (or national commitments if
they are more stringent), then this approach can also result in an environmentally
effective level of cap that is perceived to be fair. As discussed in the evaluation
above, Member States have agreed that the burden sharing agreement distributes
abatement in a manner that is fair and so setting a cap on this basis should also
meet the fairness criterion.
5.38
We think that if an analysis of the marginal costs of abatement feeds into the level
at which the target is set, then the resulting cap can also be economically efficient.
However, the only way to ensure that the total number of allowances allocated at
an EU level is consistent and economically efficient is to discard national caps in
favour of a pan-EU cap. (We discuss harmonisation in Section 7). In our view, it
is likely that governments would need to use projections to inform their view of
the appropriate reduction on the base year. However, it would be possible to fix
the projections used relatively early on to minimise the uncertainty that this
caused. Bottom up data could be used to verify the projections.
5.39
We have kept this preferred approach in mind when identifying the best practice
approach to cap setting set out in the section below.

BEST PRACTICE FOR CAP SETTING
We have drawn on the evaluation of NAPs in Phase I to set out the key points that
we suggest should be taken into account by Member States when setting caps for
Phase II. We have highlighted throughout the document how environmental
effectiveness requires caps that are transparent, economically efficient, fair and
are set at a level that achieves real emissions reductions. The purpose of this
section of the report is to summarise the findings that we have drawn from the
analysis described in detail above.
On this basis, a best practice cap would:
fix the total number of allowances (cap) early, in line with the Directive
timescales as a minimum, in order to provide certainty and assist in the
optimisation of investment decisions;
be based on a clear and transparent methodology, preferably expressed as:
a distance to target (in terms of the change on an historic base year); and
include an analysis of the marginal costs of abatement to show why it is
environmentally efficient;
present the NAP calculation step-by-step with regard to:
the national Kyoto commitment under the burden sharing agreement;
 the expected level of carbon dioxide emissions from the traded sector to
meet this commitment;
 the expected level of carbon dioxide emissions from the non-traded sector
to meet this commitment;
 the targets and measures in place to meet each of these levels; and
 comparison of each of these levels against the Kyoto base year and a
recent historic years emissions;
only use projections to inform cap setting processes that are:
independently verified and agreed at the start of the process;
 based on published and clearly identified input assumptions; and
 explained clearly;
show the relationship between the cap, the Kyoto target and any national
commitments explicitly;
be subject to formal consultation and comment:
early enough in the decision making process for views to be taken into
account;
supported by informal discussions with all stakeholders;
the timetable for consultation should be published and kept up-to-date; and
provide an indication of future cap levels in future phases (to provide
operators with greater certainty).
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Where a liquid carbon market exists, abatement will be undertaken wherever it
can be achieved at least cost, regardless of which installations the initial allocation
is made to. In such a market it is therefore the level at which the cap is set (rather
than who they are allocated to) that is the key determinant of environmental
effectiveness. However, as soon as there is a lack of liquidity and it becomes less
likely that the market will work efficiently, it becomes more important that the
initial allocation of allowances is determined on an efficient basis if abatement is
to be achieved at least cost.
Use of Projections
Projections were widely used by member states to set caps for Phase I29. We
consider that projections are an important part of any allocation methodology;
both to:
show how a cap compares to (national and international) emissions targets;
show how a cap level compares with need.
A best practice approach would thus use projections to inform the level of cap.
However we consider that once the cap level has been determined in this way, it is
preferable to define it either as an absolute amount (i.e. xMtCO2) or as a change
on a historic base year (e.g. x% reduction on 1990 levels), i.e. a distance to target.
Member states took into account both expected economic growth and future emission
levels by using projections.

KEY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
In Section 4 we evaluated each of the Phase I caps (summarised in Table 13). We
note here three key areas for improvement in each country in order to improve the
environmental effectiveness of the caps in Phase II.
Germany
Level and distance below BAU  could Germany do more?
Fairness of allocation between sectors  the allocation to the power sector in
Phase I appears relatively generous.
Transparency of documentation  the explanation of the assumptions used to
build up the cap could be clearer.
Italy
Cap level  the Phase I cap level does not appear to be in line with the Kyoto
target.
Economic efficiency  the relative costs of abatement should be considered to
determine the abatement required from the package of abatement measures
that forms Italys climate change programme.
Transparency of documentation  the level of detail in the Italian NAP could
be improved to allow a more complete understanding of the cap calculation.
Netherlands
The Netherlands places a relatively small proportion of the abatement burden
on the traded sector due to its reliance on project credits.
The relationship between the burden placed on the traded sector and meeting
the Kyoto commitment should be confirmed.
The NAP should clearly set out the assumptions made to determine the total
cap amount.
Poland
The traded sector should be required to deliver real emissions reductions.
The process to set the cap should be aligned with the allocation methodology
at an installation-level.
All stakeholders should be given equal access to all information.
Spain
The Spanish cap is not in line with the Kyoto target given historic trends in
emission.
The NAP should make clear the assumptions made regarding the relative costs
of abatement in the traded and non-traded sectors.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
The consultation process with stakeholders could be improved to ensure that
all interested parties are given equal opportunity to influence the process.
United Kingdom

Use a cap-setting process that requires a fixed proportionate reduction on a
historic base year, in line with stated national and international commitments.
Set the final cap within the timescales prescribed by the Directive.

HARMONISATION ISSUES FOR CAPS IN PHASE II
Our evaluation of the Phase I caps has highlighted how different Member States
set their caps in a wide range of ways. This has made it difficult to be sure that
we are comparing like with like and to understand the detailed assumptions
behind the final caps. There is therefore significant scope for both the cap setting
methodologies and the documentation explaining them to be harmonised in Phase
In order to improve the environmental effectiveness of the scheme, harmonisation
would need to affect:
the level of each cap (as set out in paragraph 3.15);
the way that it is calculated, to take into account:
economic efficiency, i.e. the costs of abatement inside and outside the
scheme (see paragraph 3.16);
 fairness, the way that abatement is distributed between different countries
and installations (see paragraph 3.17); and
the way that the cap calculation is explained and presented, to improve
transparency (see paragraph 3.20).
In this context then, harmonisation means aligning the level of national caps by
ensuring that the ways that they are calculated and presented are similar. We list
the key areas where harmonisation could be used to improve environmental
effectiveness below.
Level of caps
As we have identified above, in our view, one of the key determinants of
environmental effectiveness is the total number of allowances issued under the
scheme. So long as there is a liquid trading market, the total number of
allowances will determine the resulting level of emissions more than which
country or installations they are allocated to. As a result, this is a key area where
the scheme could benefit from increased harmonisation. The different options are
set out below. We identify which of these options we consider would be feasible
for Phase II.
Pan-EU cap setting
If an EU-wide cap were to be set then it would be possible to ensure that the total
number of allowances allocated contributed real emissions reductions, very
directly, beyond those that would have happened anyway.30 As discussed above,
For instance, one of the principles to set an EU cap would be that it was a fixed amount
below an agreed projection of emissions.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
this is essential to ensure the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. It is
unlikely, however, that such an approach will be possible for Phase II given that
the Directive currently allows Member States to determine the number of
allowances to be allocated at a national level and we do not expect that the
Directive will be revised for Phase II. (We discuss pan-EU cap setting further in
Section 7). In that event EU wide emissions will be capped at the level dictated
by the aggregation of the individual Member State caps  with no guarantee of a
reduction against BAU for the EU as a whole.
Harmonisation of projections
Projections were used in Phase I, both to evaluate cap levels (e.g. to confirm
consistency with the Directive criteria) and also to calculate the number of
allowances to allocate. A range of input assumptions and modelling approaches
were used. The result was that it is difficult to compare the approaches and also to
ensure that they are consistent (and so to ensure also that the levels of cap require
emissions reductions beyond those that would have happened anyway, i.e. are
environmentally effective).
For Phase II, we consider that it would be possible to develop and publish a single
set of projections, of both emissions from installations covered by the EU ETS
and also from sectors and gases outside the scheme that affect the EU Kyoto
target. These projections could be used to31:
Indicate the level below which each national cap would need to be to imply
real emissions reductions against those projections, so facilitating the
evaluation of each NAP.
Analyse the contribution that other sectors and gases are expected to make
towards the Kyoto target, and so the total number of allowances that would put
the EU in line with its Kyoto target.
Member States Phase II cap levels could then be compared against these
projections to ensure that they are at an environmentally effective level. Since
each Member States NAP is already evaluated (by the Commission), this type of
harmonisation is much more closely in line with the rules already in place than the
kind of EU-wide cap setting described in paragraph 8.5.
The extent to which such harmonisation is feasible for Phase II depends on the
extent to which such work has already been undertaken and the extent to which
the assumptions on which it is based can be put into the public domain.
Harmonised use of historic data
8.10
In the time available for Phase II then, it might be more straightforward to ensure
comparable evaluation of Phase II caps against historic emissions information.
For comment on the use of projections see paragraph 6.4.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
8.11
Although differences in opinion will exist about the most appropriate sources of
data to use, it might be possible to ensure that, say, where Kyoto targets require a
reduction in emissions, the cap is on a downward trend compared with recent
emissions. Or, for instance, that if the traded sector has emitted a proportion of a
countrys emissions in the past, the cap reflects a similar proportion of expected
national emissions for the future.
8.12
This could form part of the Commissions evaluation of the NAPs. Although such
evaluations might not ensure that the caps meet the criteria for economic
efficiency and fairness that we have established for our analysis, they could
enhance transparency, which is another requirement for environmental
effectiveness. Since historic data are already available, we consider that such
comparisons should be feasible for Phase II.
Incorporation of international targets
8.13
The Directive requires that cap levels be in line with targets for emissions
reductions. Since Phase II of the scheme corresponds to the first Kyoto
commitment period, it will be important to ensure that the caps are in line with
these targets to ensure the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. As we have
discussed above, one of the fundamental principles of the Kyoto Protocol is that
there is a degree of flexibility in the way that Member States can meet these
targets. It would not therefore be appropriate to suggest that all Member States
incorporate the targets in the same way.
8.14
It would however be possible to ensure, perhaps as part of the Commissions
evaluation of the NAPs, that the way in which these targets have been
incorporated and the implied burden on the non-traded sector are evaluated and
approved in a consistent way.
Incorporation of national targets
8.15
Where Member States have set a national target unilaterally it will be more
difficult to ensure that these targets are incorporated in a harmonised way,
especially since the incorporation of such a target will only improve the
environmental effectiveness of the scheme if it is more strict than the international
targets mentioned above.
8.16
It should however be possible to ensure that where such targets do exist and are
applicable for the traded sector, the way that they have been incorporated into the
cap is evaluated in a consistent way.
Economic efficiency
8.17
We have discussed above how it is important to balance the costs of abatement
inside and outside the traded sector if the scheme is to deliver emissions
abatement at least cost. One of the lessons we have learned from Phase I is that
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Member States have often not explained how these costs have been considered
and the assumptions used to compare costs are not always clear.
8.18
One of the factors that should be considered in assessing the abatement potential
at any price should be the likelihood of that abatement taking place (we have
mentioned above how, for instance, it is easier to affect the energy use of
industrial customers compared to, say, households).
8.19
For harmonisation to improve the environmental effectiveness of the scheme, all
Member States should move towards a cap-setting methodology that takes into
account these relative costs explicitly. We set out the different ways that
economic efficiency could be incorporated (given sufficient time and resources)
below.
Efficiency at an EU level
8.20
On a theoretical basis the optimal option is one where the relative costs of
abatement would be balanced at an EU-wide level, by comparing the costs of
abatement in the traded and non-traded sector of each country. Each Member
States cap could then be set on this basis (possibly taking into account some
adjustment for fairness, discussed below).
8.21
However, such an approach would require extensive international cooperation; the
optimal outcome would only be achieved if each Member State agreed to set its
cap on the same principles. For Phase II then, it might be possible to use a single
published analysis of the relative costs of abatement to evaluate each national cap.
However, it would be necessary to collate and make consistent data from each
Member State and possibly from a range of information sources within each
country.
Efficiency at a national level
8.22
It would also be possible to ensure that Member States move towards an approach
which sets out explicitly the way that the relative costs of abatement have been
analysed and incorporated into both the cap and wider national climate change
strategies. For instance, part of the Commission approval process could be to
ensure that each Member State provides the same information to the same level of
detail on the way that the contribution of the non-traded sector has been
incorporated.
Fairness
8.23
Given the difficulties in defining fairness and the different perspectives of each
Member State and each stakeholder, harmonisation is only likely to deliver a more
fair outcome if the total cap is determined at an EU level and the effort then
distributed on a transparent and robust basis. Even then, whether the cap is fair
will depend on the approach to distribution taken and the bargaining power of all
the parties involved.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
8.24
Fairness can impact on the environmental effectiveness of the scheme in a number
of ways. For Phase II, if decision makers do not consider the Phase I allocation
fair, they will be more likely to try and increase their own countrys allocation in
order to improve their national position. In addition, if Member States do not
consider cap levels to be fair, they will be less likely to support the scheme
beyond Phase II. We explore how harmonisation could impact on the perceived
fairness of the scheme below.
Fairness between countries and sectors
8.25
8.26
For Phase II, the following steps towards harmonisation could help to make the
NAPs more environmentally effective.
The use of the projections described above to show the level of effort a cap
level implies beyond an agreed business as usual level, both at a national and
sector level.
The use of the projections above to show at what level a national cap should
be to be considered in line with Kyoto, given each Member States
contribution under the burden sharing agreement (which, as we have
discussed, is a commitment that has been agreed to be fair).
Comparison with historical emission levels could provide important additional
information for the assessment of caps and could build a second pillar for an
integrated assessment.
If consistent projections are established, then the aggregate compliance costs for
sectors and Member States calculated on the basis of harmonized projections and
abatement costs could serve as an appropriate indicator for fairness. However, as
discussed above, some parties might not consider this approach to be fair.
Transparency
8.27
Harmonisation of the way that the cap calculation methodology is explained and
presented could facilitate comparison of the caps between countries and also the
evaluation of their level.
8.28
We consider that the NAPs would be more straightforward to understand and
evaluate if:
the cap level was described in the same way in each country (for instance, an
X% reduction on a uniform historic base year32);
Experience from Phase I and various climate change negotiations has shown it would be
nave to imply that it such a formulation could be determined without debate. Some
discussion will be inevitable to fix the number of allowances to allocate, however the
final cap level is described. Our point here is that describing the cap level in a simple,
fixed way sets a useful precedent for future phases and minimises room for
misunderstanding.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc

an analysis of relative abatement costs and the methodology used to take them
into account was provided;
a transparent description of any projections (including key data, assumptions
methodologies and sensitivities) is provided if projections are used to inform
the cap setting process;33
the reporting format to set out the assumptions and analysis behind the cap
level (covering areas such as those described above) was standardised;
a common set of indicators is developed at an EU level, reported by each
Member States, covering the areas described above;
timetables for the stakeholder consultation process were published and
regularly updated for each Member State; and
each Member State published all relevant documentation on a single national
website.
8.29
For instance, it might be possible for the Commission to set out guidance that
required the NAP submitted to include the points listed above in documentation
submitted as part of the approval process, and that that information be made
public.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
BEYOND 2012: EU CAP OPTIONS
Introduction
In this section we discuss the issues and challenges facing decision makers
beyond 2012. In this context, we summarise the range of approaches that could
be used to set cap levels beyond Phase II in order to ensure environmental
effectiveness. We also make some recommendations for the ways that caps for
the EU ETS could be set in the long-term.
Relevant issues and challenges
In the text below, we set out the headline issues and challenges facing decision
makers beyond Phase II. These issues influence the range of options available to
set caps in later phases and therefore their likely levels, the scope for economic
efficiency, the ways that fairness might be incorporated and the extent to which
transparency in decision making will be possible.
Beyond the Directive
The Emissions Trading Directive sets out some guidelines for future phases of the
scheme. For instance, it establishes that phases will be five years in length and
that the timetable for the delivery of NAPs and the surrender of allowances will
roll forward. However some conditions, such as the limits on auctioning, are only
set as far out as Phase II. As a result, the fundamental rules, on which all
decisions for the Scheme are based, will be amended after Phase II.
Next Kyoto commitment period
The first Kyoto commitment period corresponds to Phase II of the Scheme and
Member States have agreed and committed to emissions reductions to achieve in
this timeframe. No such commitment has yet been made beyond Phase II. Two
key questions remain that will affect decisions regarding EU ETS caps in
particular.
The likely nature of future commitments: i.e. the way that caps will be
coordinated with wider Kyoto commitments. For instance, whether or not a
cap for the traded sector will form an explicit part of any future burden sharing
agreement.
The likely nature of EU commitments: both in terms of the level of abatement
that will be required from the EU and also the way that this will be shared
across individual Member States.
Future burden sharing agreements
The burden sharing agreement, which splits the wider EU target amongst the
individual Member States also only covers Phase II. It is possible that a similar
agreement will be reached for future Kyoto commitment periods. However, it is
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
also possible that the abatement requirements may be spread out in a different
way. The approach taken to burden sharing will determine the abatement required
from a Member State, which will influence any decisions on cap levels.
Extended time frame
Although the business plans of commercial organisations already stretch beyond
Phase II, 2012 is a relatively long way off for decision makers and Governments
currently trying to determine caps for Phase II. Experience has shown how there
can be political reluctance to make medium-term commitments on climate change,
particularly before it is clear what impact existing policies and measures will have
had by the time those commitments come into force.
Need for long-term certainty
Although the wide range of influences that impact on emissions means that some
degree of uncertainty is inevitable in any carbon market, long-term certainty is
important if operators are to make investment decisions that are optimal from an
environmental perspective. Decision makers can assist by setting medium- and
long-run goals for schemes such as the EU ETS, in order to help participants plan
for the future.
Interaction with other schemes and mechanisms
It has yet to be seen how successfully the project mechanisms will be integrated with
the EU ETS in Phases I and II. In the longer term, it will become feasible, if not
essential, to integrate the scheme with other initiatives to reduce emissions on a global
scale. The impact of such integration on cap setting will depend on the initiatives to
which the EU ETS is linked and the sectors and gases that they cover.
How much national  how much European  how much global
One of the key questions in considering caps in the long term is the extent to which
abatement of greenhouse gases will be determined at a national, EU or global level.
By its very nature, global warming needs to be tackled in a cohesive way. In the
context of the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that international agreements to constrain
emissions will continue to form the framework for abatement.
9.10
The scope of any international agreements will be determined to a large extent by
the political views of the key governments. This will affect whether or not a
global cap and trade scheme will be introduced. With the EU, and countries like
Japan, Canada and some US states setting up emissions trading schemes, there is
arguably a political impetus to establish an international trading scheme.
Although it might be argued that the involvement of some of the non-Annex I
countries could help to support such a critical mass.
9.11
Whether and how international targets are cascaded down to individual countries
will depend to some extent on the infrastructures already in place to accommodate
targets. The EU ETS will form a useful platform to build on. Not only has it
established the rules for international emissions trading, it has also familiarised a
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
large number of operators with the challenges and opportunities that such a
scheme presents.
9.12
Looking at the balance of commitments between national governments and the
EU then, this will depend on a number of far reaching questions, including:
the nature and membership of the EU in the future; and
the balance of power between national Governments and the Commission.
EU wide commitments could negate the need for national decisions on caps.
Equally the principles that underpin the EU point to the continued national
involvement in the detailed implementation of any future trading schemes.
Future approaches to the EU ETS  key questions and guiding
principles
Future (long term) cap
Length of Phase
9.13
The first question when considering cap levels is the number of years that any cap
will cover. The Directive currently establishes that all future Phases will be five
years in length. From an environmental effectiveness perspective, a key
advantage of five-year phases is that the cap is updated relatively regularly which
will ensure that it does not become out of line if emissions trends are other than
expected. One of the disadvantages is that it does not provide the long-term
certainty required for operators to invest in the optimal way.
9.14
Alternatives would either be to have shorter phases (such as the three years used
for Phase I). Although this provided more flexibility to ensure that the total
number of allowances is likely to achieve real emissions reductions beyond those
that would have happened anyway, the regular changing of the number of
allowances allocated would not assist operator certainty or transparency.
9.15
The other approach then is to dispense with the principle of Phases and set caps
according to predetermined path, in which the number of allowances changes
consistently from year-to-year (e.g. an X% reduction on the previous year). The
main advantage of this approach is the long-term signals that it provides for
investors. However, the allocation methodology for individual installations would
also need to be fixed if it is really to provide long-term certainty. Another
disadvantage is that it would not be possible to factor in economic efficiency to
this approach except for when caps are set initially, or take account of unforeseen
changes in circumstances (such as movements in fuel price relativities).
EU-wide commitment or national caps?
9.16
In the longer-term, it would be possible for an EU wide cap for the EU ETS to be
set, rather than individual country caps. The main advantage of this approach
would be that the total number of allowances issued, in our view one of the key
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
determinants of the environmental effectiveness of the scheme, could be set in a
considered way that reflected each of our criteria (efficiency, transparency and
fairness). Under this approach, even if Member States inflate individual caps to
protect international competitiveness, the total number of allowances would
remain unchanged.
9.17
A second key advantage is that by committing to a level of emissions from the
traded sector, on the assumption that there also continues to be an economy-wide
target,34 an EU level cap would also imply a level of ambition for the non-traded
sector. If the level of emissions is set at an EU wide level, this will make it easier
to ensure that the emissions reductions sought from these installations reflects
their ability and propensity to abate. The information used to strike this balance
would of course need to be published if the approach is to be transparent.
Harmonisation
9.18
Whether or not an EU-wide cap is possible will depend on the decision-making
process beyond Phase II and also the political momentum behind such an idea.
Given the Kyoto target was agreed at an EU level, it should be possible in
principle; however it would inevitably take some time.
9.19
It is worth bearing in mind that since the Kyoto Protocol provides for Member
States to meet national targets flexibly, it could be argued that it is not appropriate
for targets for individual schemes to be assigned. If the scope of the scheme is
extended (discussed further below) such arguments would carry less weight.
9.20
A second-best to an EU-wide cap would be for a harmonised approach across all
Member States. We have proposed some ideas for harmonisation in Phase II in
Section 7. Harmonisation could help to ensure that all countries take into account
the same factors when determining cap levels, so that the final level of allowances
issued will deliver real emissions reductions beyond those that would have
happened anyway.
Full auctioning
9.21
An EU wide cap of the kind above would need to be distributed between
installations in one way or another. From an efficiency and environmental
effectiveness perspective, our preferred approach to allocation is auctioning. Full
auctioning of an EU wide cap in a harmonised way would lead to an efficient
distribution of abatement. For full auctioning to work successfully, the rules and
mechanisms put in place would need to be equally open to all participants in all
Member States (and they would need to be transparent and fair).
This assumption is based on the fact that the key driver of climate change is the total
GHG emissions (i.e. from all sectors) and therefore targets are likely to be set on an
economy wide basis.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
9.22
Another advantage of full auctioning is that it would reduce the need for market
intervention of the kinds proposed for Phase I. The possibility of windfall taxes35
distorts the incentives of the scheme, and also introduces further regulatory
uncertainty36.
Burden sharing
9.23
Many of the arguments in favour of grandfathering (e.g. that it compensates
stranded assets and eases the transition to assigning a value to emissions) are
eroded once the scheme has been up and running for a number of phases. For
instance, installations have had warning that the costs of carbon should be
incorporated in investment decisions. However, full auctioning might not be
possible for political reasons. Decision makers might continue to feel it necessary
to reduce the costs incurred by industry by allocating at least a proportion of
allowances for free.
9.24
Under these circumstances, it will be necessary to continue to determine who
these allowances are grandfathered to. National concerns regarding
competitiveness and the differential makeup of the traded sector in each country
will strengthen arguments in favour of allowing national governments to perform
the allocation.
9.25
The most likely way for the burden to be shared between Member States is
through a bargaining approach, since this allows each country to promote national
interests in a world where each is competing for a share of a finite number of
allowances. In theory, so long as the market is liquid, the way that the total
number of allowances is allocated between states (and between installations, for
that matter) should not affect the level of emissions or the costs at which they are
achieved.37 Thus, the key is that this initial total number, for the EU as a whole, is
set taking all of the criteria for environmental effectiveness discussed in this
report into account.
9.26
Any burden sharing agreement could be separated out between the contribution of
the traded and non-traded sectors. The main advantages of such an approach are
the certainty and transparency that it could provide. The main disadvantage is that
To recoup revenues from free allowances in those sectors where the cost of carbon will be
passed through to prices.

environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union Emissions
Trading Scheme: Structural aspects of the allocation authored by the ko-Institut.
However we have seen in Phase I that, in practice, the allocation methodology can impact
on investment decisions. For further analysis of how and why this is the case, refer to a
separate report The environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency of the
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme: Structural aspects of the allocation
authored by the ko-Institut.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
it reduces the flexibility for Member States to meet the total emissions level, and
so could compromise efficiency.38
Inclusion of other sectors and gases
9.27
Member States may choose to unilaterally expand the scope of the scheme in
Phase II to include other installations that emit carbon dioxide, process emissions
from other sectors and other gases (over and above those in Phase I). In the
longer-term, it would be possible to expand the scheme in all these directions, so
long as a single fungible currency39 could be developed (this would require
standardised monitoring and reporting protocols that are internationally
recognised and consistently enforced).
Advantages
9.28
We list the key advantages to such inclusions to the scheme from an
environmental effectiveness perspective below.
Increased liquidity: the wider the coverage of the scheme, the greater the
number of operators involved and the emissions to be traded. As we have
noted above, a liquid market is essential if a trading scheme is to deliver
abatement at least cost, so this is a key point for environmental effectiveness.
Possible erosion of some competitiveness impacts: one of the concerns raised
in the pilot phase of the scheme is that by capturing only a subset of
installations and allowing the definition of an installation to vary between
Member States, not all similar emissions sources are captured under the
scheme. Extending it to cover more installations could therefore reduce any
such competitiveness impacts. This could improve the fairness of the scheme.
Reduced monitoring costs for some kinds of installations: by including a
subset of gases and sources, some installations have needed to disaggregate
data for monitoring and reporting purposes, for instance introducing submetering. This imposes additional costs on participants (so impacts on
efficiency) and may also make it more difficult to monitor and report emission
effectively (affecting transparency).
Reduced room for differences between countries: it is possible that expansion
could reduce the potential for differences in definitions between countries, by
capturing a wider range of emissions sources and so reducing the leeway for
individual Member States to exclude installations from the scheme.
Allowing the market to define the appropriate level of abatement from the traded and non
traded sectors results in a more efficient distribution than administratively set levels. If
the balance of abatement between the traded and non-traded sectors is defined at the
outset, in the burden-sharing agreement, it is not then possible to adjust this balance in the
light of changing circumstances (such as movements in relative fuel prices).
Such as tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Disadvantages
9.29
9.30
There are, on the other hand, some disadvantages to this scheme expansion.
There are more emissions to monitor and report: thus increasing the
complexity,40 and so possibly reducing the transparency, of the scheme.
High costs of implementation for some sectors: it will be more costly to
expand the scheme to some sectors than those incorporated under the
Directive as it stands at the moment. For instance, extending the scheme to
mobile sources (particularly any that move internationally  transport and
aviation, for instance) would require considerable adjustment to the rules. It
might be more transparent and less costly to link a separate scheme for
emissions from such sources to the EU ETS rather than trying to incorporate
them within in it.
Complexity of allocation distribution: if grandfathering continues to be the
preferred method of allowance allocation, expansion of the scheme will make
this process considerably more complex.
Compliance costs may outweigh the benefits of abatement potential for some
emitters, particularly those sectors where inclusion would be especially costly,
such as transport and aviation.
From a cap perspective then, the more kinds of emissions captured in the scheme,
the greater the number of issues that need to be considered when setting a cap.
For instance, in order to establish need, projections for an expanded scheme
would need to look at a range of gases, not just carbon dioxide41.
Principles for expansion in an environmentally effective way
9.31
WWF has asked what kinds of expansion would most impact on the
environmental effectiveness of the scheme (focussing on cap setting here). We do
not have a view on particular sectors. Instead, we consider that to meet this aim,
any expansion should be based on the following principles.
Significant emitters of greenhouse gases: inclusion of larger emitters42 will
mean that the liquidity and so efficiency of the scheme is enhanced at least
implementation cost.
In an extreme case, the increased complexity could cause the operation of the scheme to
become unmanageable.
Although it is worth noting that these sorts of considerations are already taken into
account in the context of national climate change policy, so it is not necessarily that new
work would be required, but that the context for it would change.
For instance, the UK has consulted on whether the scheme should be expanded to the
following sectors: gypsum, glass, foundries and other ferrous metals, petrochemicals,
rock wool, integrated steelworks and offshore flaring.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Sectors where emissions can be clearly defined, monitored and reported: both
to ensure that the scheme remains transparent and also to maintain the
environmental integrity of the scheme.
Sectors where the costs of expansion do not outweigh the abatement benefit
that can be achieved from them: we do not consider that expansion of the
scheme to small emitters with high abatement costs would be fair.
Expansion is harmonised: to ensure that the coverage of the scheme is fair
across member states and also to make any analysis of the emissions and
abatement potentials of participants as straightforward as possible.
Interaction between EU ETS and future EU burden sharing agreements
9.32
One of the areas that we have touched on above is the fact that the way that caps
are set in future phases of the scheme will affect the way that Member States meet
national abatement targets. Some of the issues around this interaction, which are
of particular concern from an environmental effectiveness perspective, are
highlighted below.
Efficiency considerations (marginal costs)
9.33
One element for achieving environmental effectiveness is that emissions
reductions are achieved in an efficient way. One way to enhance efficiency in a
liquid market is to provide operators with as much flexibility as possible. Setting
sub-targets for particular policies and measures43 within a particular overall target
can curb this flexibility, but this impact must be balanced against the increased
transparency and certainty that it provides.
Fairness considerations
9.34
Another important issue is fairness. Agreeing the burden to be carried by
different installations can influence stakeholders perception that the approach is
fair, particularly if it is structured to take into account issues such as the relative
costs of abatement.
9.35
We have mentioned how equalising the cost burden to be carried by sectors and
Member States is perceived as fair by some. Such an approach is only possible
through international cooperation and a coordinated attempt to spread the
abatement required.
Transparency considerations
9.36
Setting explicit targets for different policies and measures can provide clarity and
therefore aid transparency. At the same time, since international agreements are
more likely to be the result of a bargaining approach than national agreements,
i.e. in theory it would be more economically efficient to allow the market to decide where
abatement should occur rather than divide up the abatement effort administratively.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
transparency may be better served by allowing individual Member States to set
and explain the reasons behind caps themselves.
Politics and bargaining
9.37
Given the number of interest groups involved and the international nature of the
challenge, political concerns will continue to be a feature of cap setting beyond
Phase II. There are likely to be a range of views around whether it is appropriate
to set EU ETS caps as part of wider climate change agreements or not. It is most
likely that the final approach will be the outcome of bargaining by all the groups
involved.
Auctioning or not
9.38
We have highlighted above how, from an efficiency perspective, full auctioning
should be implemented as soon as possible. However, as we have mentioned
above, there may be some political concerns that limit the speed with which this
can be adopted.
9.39
From a practical perspective, auctioning could be introduced incrementally:
Through requiring partial auctioning at a national level, by stipulating the way
that the levels set out for the early phases of the scheme should be applied.
By auctioning allowances to particular sectors, perhaps focussing on those that
are best placed to pass on the costs of carbon to prices (the power sector has
been identified as one such sector in some countries in Phase I).
However, since neither of these choices need affect the total number of
allowances allocated, we do not focus on them here. Equally, questions of how
often auctioning should take place and how the revenue thus raised might be used
are structural rather than cap-setting issues.44
9.40
One of the advantages of auctioning would be that it could reduce the need for
national allocation plans and therefore the whole approval process that
accompanies them. For instance, if an EU wide cap sets the total number of
allowances to distribute, then the concept of allocations disappears since none of
the allowances would be handed out for free. Instead, each operator would decide
the number of allowances it should buy to cover emissions from its installation.
9.41
The most efficient approach would be for a single independent body to be responsible
for auctioning all allowances, since this would minimise the costs to set up the
necessary systems and would help to ensure that the process is transparent and open
to all parties on the same basis. It would also help to ensure that allowances are

effectiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union Emissions Trading
Scheme: Structural aspects of the allocation authored by the ko-Institut.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
released onto the market in a co-ordinated and pre-defined way, to ensure that the
availability of allowances does not adversely affect market signals.
9.42
If auction is implemented incrementally (by focussing on particular sectors,
countries or both), then the quantities for auction should be determined on the
basis of economic efficiency (as we have recommended should be the approach
for cap setting under a regime with free allocations).
Alternatives to auctioning that ensure environmental effectiveness & efficiency
9.43
We have highlighted above that our preferred approach to the distribution of
allowances would be auctioning. There are a range of approaches that would help
to ensure that any resulting distribution is environmentally effective:
As we have discussed throughout this report, our preferred approach to cap
setting would take into account the marginal costs of abatement in different
sectors. This should be incorporated to share out any burden beyond Phase II.
This cap should be expressed as a distance to target.
In terms of fairness, any sharing of a burden should consider efforts already
made in different countries and also the differences in costs and potential for
abatement in the Phase for which the cap is being set.
The shared burdens should be expressed in a clear and transparent way. The
burden sharing approach used for Phase II is relatively simple to understand,
although the use of bargaining means that it is not possible to see exactly how
cost and efficiency concerns have influenced the final outcome.
Transparency in decision-making is key if the caps are to be environmentally
effective in the absence of auctioning. As we have found for Phase I, it is
difficult to evaluate the efficiency of caps unless they are presented in a clear
and transparent way. Such clarity is relatively straightforward and cheap to
achieve, but can have a significant impact on credibility and the long-term
success of the scheme.
Each cap level must be consistent with existing international and national
commitments.
Lessons that should be drawn from the long-term considerations for Phase II
9.44
Given the longer time frame, there is much greater scope for changes to the cap
setting approach used in the EU ETS in the longer term than for Phase II.
However, there are a number of lessons that we can draw from the issues set out
above to inform the Phase II caps.
There is a need for certainty to promote investment that delivers emissions
reductions: this could be enhanced by indicating how the level of caps and the
way that they will be described will be approached in the long-term.
The discussion above highlights that there is considerable uncertainty beyond
Phase II: one way to reduce the perception of regulatory risk and so to
promote environmentally efficient behaviour is to provide early warning.
170EnvtEffectivenessA_v6_0.doc
October 2005
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU ETS
Long-term statements and early warning will only be possible if there is
political backing behind them. The discussion above highlights just how
many decision makers will be involved in the deciding the future of the
scheme. International, regional and national issues will all be reflected in
future cap discussions.
Harmonised NAPs could provide a sound starting point for the future: Phase II
could set a precedent for future Phases of the scheme. In addition, a
successful scheme that has set up an infrastructure for emissions trading could
form a platform for a wider scheme post 2012.
Burden sharing and national, sector or installation-level allocations should not
be conducted in isolation: it is essential that the interaction between each of
these be considered if the total number of allowances allocated is to be at an
effective level.
Beyond 2012: cap recommendations
9.45
Given our analysis of the Phase I NAPs, the key issues that we consider important
to set environmentally effective caps beyond 2012 are set out below. These are
points that could be borne in mind by all decision makers when determining
policies for the period beyond Phase II.
Decisions should be made as early as possible not just on the cap level, but
also on the principles for the long-term operation of the scheme in order to
provide operators with a degree of certainty.
The total number of allowances and role of project credits should be set at as
aggregate a level as possible (i.e. an EU level).
Harmonisation of approach at any level would help keep things simple,
reducing the range of methodologies that interested parties need to understand
and facilitating the like-for-like comparison of each aspect.
Steps should be taken to ensure that a liquid market develops  this objective
could be facilitated through expansion of the scheme.
The length of each Phase should be fixed. Keeping at the same length as
Phase II (5 years) would help ensure consistency.
Projections will inform the debate but a single, published set should be used
by everybody.
Given the uncertainties surrounding projections, targets and commitments
should also be described against a historical base.
Rules and decisions should be explained in as transparent a way as possible.

SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK
Summary
10.1
10.2
In summary, Phase I has provided an opportunity for Member States to develop
cap levels that determine emissions levels over three years. As future phases of
the scheme cover five years, it will be increasingly important that our four criteria
for environmental effectiveness are considered when setting caps. To reiterate,
the criteria that we have identified to ensure environmental effectiveness are:
level of cap: beyond business as usual, and in line with Kyoto and in line with
Kyoto and national targets;
economic efficiency;
fairness; and
transparency.
Member states have used a variety of methodologies to develop caps for Phase I
that have been presented in a wide range of ways. None of the Phase I NAPs
analysed in this report met all criteria, and opportunities exist for improvement in
the next phase.
Recommendations
10.3
We have summarised the key areas for improvement in each of the NAPs in
Section 7 of this report. In particular, we consider that there are areas where
increased harmonisation could improve the environmental effectiveness of the
scheme. For instance, ensuring that all Member States provide a sufficient
amount of information to the level of detail necessary to understand the cap
calculation would greatly improve the transparency of the caps.
10.4
Our preferred approach to cap setting is to take into account the marginal cost of
abatement and to express the cap as a distance to target.
Outlook
10.5
Looking forward, significant challenges exist to ensure that the scheme delivers
emissions reductions beyond those that would have occurred anyway. There are
some key issues that it is worth highlighting:
Political acceptability: caps must be acceptable both across and within
countries to ensure the credibility of the scheme.
Negotiation process: the setting of EU ETS caps beyond Phase II will form
part of the wider climate change negotiations that will define international
